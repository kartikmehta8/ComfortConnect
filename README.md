Our project is a voice-based platform for mental health support, addressing the global public health concern of limited access to mental health resources and social stigma around seeking help.
</p>
</h3>

- The platform includes **three Amazon Alexa skills**: a mood tracker, an ambient noise skill, and a voice-only social media platform for community and support.
- The platform is also integrated with **Twilio and OpenAI** to provide accessibility through normal calling and WhatsApp chatbot features.
- **Machine learning models** are used to scrape data from anonymous online platforms such as Reddit to provide effective remedies for mental health concerns.
- The platform aims to improve overall well-being and happiness by addressing mental health, which is a significant factor in determining happiness and well-being as per the **World Happiness Report by UNSDG**.
