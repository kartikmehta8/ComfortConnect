Mint is a voice-enabled and multilingual application available in Indian regional languages for adolescents, adults, and PWDs to detect mental health issues and aid people in managing them. Mint can detect schizophrenia, suicidal intention, anxiety, and depression.<br>
"TicTac" is Mint's video conferencing and chat platform where users can connect with support groups and doctors. Mint tracks the real-time location of the user which enables the caretakers to know the location of the patients and helps to analyze the behavior of the users. <br>
Mint has a very simple passwordless authentication system that can be used by all kinds of users. An interesting aspect of Mint is that it offers music and art therapy to the users which helps in the upliftment of their mental health.

## Features
### Early Stage Schizophrenia Detection
-	According to the article ‘Schizophrenia Detection Using Machine Learning Approach from Social Media Content by Yi Ji Bae’, the linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) analysis of the posts from reddit shows elevated use of words relevant to health issues, anxiety, negative emotions, and first-person singular pronouns among users in schizophrenia compared to healthy controls.
-	This forms the basis of the classification of text by machine learning.

### Anxiety & Depression Detection
-	People suffering from anxiety and depression often express it through text on social media. Clear indicators like words related to these can be seen in the posts. 
-	These indicators form the basis of classification.

### Suicide Detection
-	Suicidal ideation is people’s thoughts about committing suicide. Potential victims with suicidal ideation may express their thoughts of committing suicide in the form of fleeting thoughts, suicide plan, dangerous intentions or behaviors before tragedy strikes. 
-	These form the demarcation between normal texts and suicidal texts for machine learning.

### TicTac: The Mint Conferencing Platform
- Patients can connect with their doctors online. 
- Schizophrenic patients do not have access to group therapy in particular, with online chat-rooms, they will be able to get the support they need.
- Patients having other mental diseases can also connect in their specific rooms to help each other through talking about it.

### Multi Language UI
- To facilitate users from all over India, Mint uses Google Translate to make all the information on the application be available in their local language thereby making language a bridge instead of a barrier.

### Login Without A Password
- People having mental issues might find it inconvenient to remember several different passwords. 
- Passwordless authentication system by SAWO offers a more secure login for the users with an improved UX. 
- This authentication system is now being considered to be better than passwords with biometrics, SSO and social login.

### Minty Art Therapy
- Art therapy can be beneficial for the adolescents using our application as well as the adults. 
- Art offers a sense of relaxation and accomplishment while engaging the users in a mindful activity.

## Future Scope
### The Minty Dashboard
- Data visualisation helps users analyse their activities and helps them to improve / change any habit they are undertaking. It is a compiled report of the different activities and features that the user is using on the app. This report can be used by the user directly or provided to their doctor.
- The report will contain:
1. Record of user visiting different places. 
2. Record of user taking their medications on time. 
3. Record of user exercising. 
4. Record of user spending time listening to music. 
5. Record of user spending time on the support group channel.
6. Record of user spending time doing art therapy.

### Minty: The Voice Assistant @Mint
- Considering our users belonging to the PWD group, with the help of AlanAI, the entire application can be accessed without navigating manually but by voice activated commands. 
- With the growth of voice assistants, voice UX is a new paradigm that our application will shift to.

### Mint Tracks Real-Time Location
- Schizophrenic patients need to be with their caretakers at all times to ensure that they are not harming themselves. In case one such patient goes out of sight of the caretaker, location tracking will enable the caretaker to reach the location at the earliest.
- This location tracking can also enable the doctor to judge the daily activities of the patient such as the places he visits, which can help in control of addictive and destructive behavior.
