brokenwithpain,2022-03-14 18:22:30+00:00,Lost,"I’m so hurt I could use a hug right now now but no one is around. I have no one but my kids and as much as they have seen and heard they can’t begin to think of how I can possibly feel right now nor do I want them to have to know because they are just innocent babies that have seen and heard more than they ever needed to. I need someone to understand or maybe I just need to understand myself more. I feel lost I’m fighting once again to keep this relationship going and for what? Who is it that I’m making happy by doing so what am I trying to achieve? Happiness of course who doesn’t want to be happy that’s all I have ever wanted was for all of my family to be happy. I feel so misunderstood everytime I try to make things right I do wrong and it’s not my intentions but that’s how I get treated. I’m made out to be some malicious bitch with ill intent as if I’m being sarcastic for trying to do good. I question if I have ever experienced happiness I want to know what it really feels like. I feel broken and hurt I don’t know what will lead to fixing that. Is this going to make me happy or will it just make me think thats what I need to be happy. I feel there is no fixing this and maybe it was never supposed to be but it was forced and now this is me dealing with it. I don’t know what’s right and what’s not anymore I don’t know what’s supposed to be and what’s not. I’m hurting from the inside out I feel broken. I don’t have anyone to talk to my mom is the only one that even is close to someone I can talk to but she is dealing with her own stress and I’m not sure she can ever understand what exactly it is I’m going through and there’s always a sense of judgment I feel why bother. I have never had many friends I always thought a small circle was best keeping only the ones in my life that I thought truly cared but over the years I have found no one truly cares when I need them they aren’t around I have none but my kids and they are to young to understand and I don’t want to put my burdens on them to what make myself feel better that’s not their job it’s my job to protect them from hurt not to involve them in my hurt. I have been down the road of leaving before and all though I felt like I could be happy I have to question what was real. I put on a front and pretended to be happy most of the time. Fake it til I make it deal but I found myself alone and crying and feeling used and I needed back what I was used to having which was my love of my life and someone I can’t see myself without the father of my kids but I feel it’s my perception of what I want him to be who I always hoped he could be for me because when I think of him it’s never what my reality is with him. He doesn’t understand me I honestly don’t believe he even cares about me although I would give anything to have that care. I feel I need it so bad to be complete I feel so sad when he’s not here but why what do I get from it? I don’t know the answer to it. Why do I crave someone so bad that doesn’t feel about me the way I feel about him and why do I feel that way when I don’t get much happiness from it but only hurt. My heart is shattered it has been for years, I never seem to make the right decisions. I want my dreams my fantasies in my head to be real but the reality is far different. I feel everything is so beyond repair and there’s not much I can do to fix anything and what is there to fix anyway. I always find out even when I have him that it never brings me the happiness I think it will. I want him to love me the way I love him. I want a best friend to care about me and treat me good and want to be around me someone that’s genuinely happy with me and I don’t think it’s in the cards for me. I don’t know what my purpose is what I’m supposed to be doing who I’m supposed to be with if anyone. I tried with him I tried without. I was lead to believe I could be cared for and thought it was finally what I needed but it never felt right and it was never right I was just being used and manipulated into believing so. I get so angry with myself because it seems any decision I make is never a good one and I’m not sure there even is a good one. I don’t know what there is I feel torn and so fucking lost. I cry and beg and plead for what? What is it I’m trying to achieve I can’t make sense out of it. I know I want my kids happy I have changed so much as a person but not good enough I haven’t been able to protect them from everything and they have seen and heard things I wish they never had. Does it make me a bad mom? I hope not but I don’t think I’m the best. I let my emotions get ahold of me and lash out at times and argue with their father which has anger issues and it doesn’t matter if the kids hear him saying the hurtful things he says about their mother. It’s now gone as far as them hearing about our sex life that is a disaster because he won’t keep his voice down. I’m ashamed and embarrassed I can think of a million emotions of how I feel besides the good ones. I look at some other relationships and families and I am so envious I want it so bad that happiness that bond the loyalty I need it but am I the one keeping myself from that or do I even deserve it. I understand how people Jill themselves because I have sat there with the 9mm in my hand many times knowing I can end all the pain and I have the power In my hands but then I realize it’s inky my kids I will hurt. I have to ask myself who else would care? I would say my mom but she would get through it but my kids I believe would be crushed and for that reason I can’t ever pull the trigger. I don’t know what to do other than cry. Why is it that I don’t deserve to be happy am I possibly not a good person I have to question that. I try to be but I’m not sure it’s ever good enough I just want the pain to stop. I want the heart ache to stop and I especially want my kids to stop hurting. I want to make the right decisions for them but I never know what it is. If I stay they hurt if I leave they hurt it’s fucked up and I don’t know what to do. The walls are closing in and I try to stay strong for them but the reality is I’m very weak and feel useless"

Puzzled-Ad3413,2022-03-14 08:37:19+00:00,Male Reddit users advice needed,"I have been with my BF for almost 4 years (come May) my BF had a change in job which effected his life alot about 1 year in, he doesn't feel happy unless he is the boss anymore (is my theroy), he has switched jobs from mechanic, liquor store manager, temp jobs and car sales men. He's switched more than I can keep track of. I didn't grow up with money so it didn't bother me. We keep all finances separate income and outgoing (we've lived together for 2 years? Maybe 3?) so as long as he had his paid I didn't care. We fight because when we first got together we had sex often (I lost my virginity to him at 19, he was 29) now it's 2 times a month if I'm lucky. He said he is depressed, he said he feels like he has nothing to look forward to, no goals. I told him to set goals, gave him a few ideas, but he shot that down. He didn't show any stereotypical signs that he is depressed. He still eats, showers, does his hobbies, doesn't sleep to much or to little, keeps the house clean, plays games with friends etc. I don't know how to help him, any advice for the depression?
TIA"

My late discovery of my mental illnesses has resulted in me feeling like I don't know who I am and I've been falling apart ever since.,"I didn't get diagnosed with ADHD until I was 21. I was diagnosed with Asperger's / High Functioning Autism when Covid hit around 2 years ago. I'm 37 now. I've questioned everything in my life up to this point now. Did I fail at X because it just wasn't for me? Did I fail at it because of ADHD? or Did I fail at it because I'm autistic? All of the life experiences that helped shape me have come into question now and I just feel like a fucking mess. The foundations of who I am have been rocked and just slowly crumbling since. 


I'm so fucking sad and feel like I can't comprehend if I'm even right or wrong about anything anymore. I just feel like I'm a screwed up mess that everyone eventually just doesn't want to be around. 

I'm just so fucking sad. I have no one to relate to about anything."

I lost my job the first week in February and it’s only gotten worse but it was almost as bad when I had a job. It was a remote sales job where I was the only one in my territory. My boss is old and the National sales manager quit so he fired me bc he couldn’t manage me and I wasn’t selling up to par. I don’t blame him bc I def wasn’t doing enough.  But not I have all the free time in the world.  The only activities I have are basketball and the gym! I literally do NOTHING else and I barely do those! Couple times a week max especially recently. I’m nervous about my next job this is beginning to become a pattern. I’ve had 3 different jobs in the last 7 years and probably about 2 years of gaps in between.  Recently my anxiety came back HARD and I’m dying inside.  Want to do more but struggling to find the motivation to do ANYTHING.  Insomnia has gotten really bad as a result of anxiety and I can barely do what I’m doing now. NOTHING. 

I’ll go through 2022 for you.   

Starts with oversleeping from insomnia the night before.   
Wake up around noon.  
Decide whether I want to jerk off or not Decide what I want to eat.  
Drink coffee so I can have a bowel movement.  
Get immersed in useless clips on my phone and social media Check emails for work (before I got fired In February) 
Decide what I want to eat again 
Decide whether I want to take a nap  
Decide whether I want to go to the gym  Decide whether I want to take a nap  Decide whether I want to gamble on a random sports events 
Decide whether I want to ask my girlfriend for sex to which she usually says no (dead bedroom problems)  Watch tik tok Worldstar social media and other random videos and Reddit until 12 Am 
Watch a movie till 2 am bc I couldn’t sleep  
Insomnia till 5:30-6-am   
Wake up at Noon
Rinse and repeat"

I had hoped to get better for a while, but nowadays, I honestly think it will last my entire life.  Without the meds I just go crazy and I've tried many things to help with this condition, but it's no use.  I am slowly becoming more and more socially isolated and losing hope in life.  It wouldn't be the first time I've thought about suicide, and to be honest I almost killed myself during a crisis, which led to my diagnosis at 18.  I feel like I drag myself through life instead of actually living it.  I can still work (despite having been away several times), spend some time with my family and friends, but it's getting harder and harder.  I feel more and more uncomfortable with people and this leads me to isolate myself.  I don't really know what to do or what to ask here, I just feel like I need to talk to people other than psychologists and psychiatrists."

Perfect_Try7261,2022-03-14 02:47:22+00:00,Exercise mood hack,"Working out while depressed feels horrible and it is the LAST thing i want to do. It hurts it sucks and you don’t even want to get out of bed let alone try and concentrate on a pointless push-up or even a walk.

I realized that if I suffer for 30 minutes doing the bare minimum, like a walk or something, yes it’s horrible suffering, but the next day I wake up feeling a bit better.

If I want to feel slightly better tomorrow, I need to exercise today. 

I feel like depressed brains have a hard time computing that. We want things to feel better now, and don’t have any hope for the future to feel better. 

Hope it helps somebody"

whycantibegoodat,2022-03-14 02:30:21+00:00,Frustrated with myself,"I feel like I’m slowly developing mild depression. I don’t want to get diagnosed, I don’t want people that I know to find out. I do say I think of killing myself a few times a day and picture my death. But it’s a challenge I feel I will one day beat.

To try to keep things short. I feel like a failure, feel worthless. I feel like I should be privileged that I have accomplished decent things in my 20s but I feel like if Im not at the top of my game on at least one thing. I get very frustrated and some might say extremely down about it while trying very hard not to show. I try not to be average at things I generally am interested in. If i am not satisfied with a rank in a game I place in or a goal I set for myself. I always think what’s the point and it goes downhill there.

I don’t kill myself because part of me is like Peter Parker saying to himself trying to do better. Another just wants to relax and not worry about anything. Another is very angry at myself and disappointed. I feel I have different viewpoints that conflict with one another. Ultimately if u met me, I would say I am very normal, people would say I am doing okay to good, I strive to be nice, kind, honorable, and hold myself to a very standard if possible.

Another thing I would like to put here is people say I am quite mentally strong and able to take difficult days or things mentally. I just worry about being in a hole. I get body aches when I’m in my sad moods. I also have graduated from college, don’t have a gf (something I eventually aim to pursue), play a few games at a very high level (shooters). But a few phrases that resonate are “never good enough”, “what’s the point”., “it’s all my fault”, “anything bad that happens to me happens because I didn’t do good enough and I deserve this suffering”.

Sorry for the probably misconstrued text lol, I just need to vent my insecurities and aim to fix them one day, but I will say it’s sometimes like a cycle that ends in me not wanting to improve."
LawrenceDigitalNomad,2022-03-14 02:23:55+00:00,"My entire life has been nothing but shit. Due to recent events of the past few weeks, I have decided to take my own life."," 

This  is a decision that I am content with. I am at peace with it. I am not  posting this as a cry for help, nor am I begging for attention. I am  just looking for people to talk to, maybe people that can relate, or  other people that suffer from depression as well. I would love to be  able to help anybody else that suffers the way that I do. If I can save  just one person before I pass on, it might actually make me smile for  the first time in ten years.

My  entire life has been nothing but shit. I was born into a family where my  father was a raging alcoholic/druggie, my mother was psychotic, my  grandfather was in the Klan, my grandmother was a devout Christian  (moravian), and my uncle was nuts.

I  was beaten at home, bullied at school, and lonely everywhere else. My  grandparents knew that my father was beating me, but did nothing about  it. The school knew that I was being bullied, and started saying that I  had an over-active imagination and ADHD, so they could pretend that no  bullying was happening in their schools. I've never had a friendship  last for more than two weeks, half of the time because I never learned  how to talk to people, and the other half because the other person  stabbed me in the back, and cast me aside once they had no more use for  me.

I have a lot of stories. I've  been in a mental home, I was forced into special needs classes in an  attempt to hide a bullying scandal, my dad hit me in the head with a  baseball bat (and tore down my treehouse with his car, and beat our cat  to death in front of me, etc etc etc), and much more.

I've  always been a kind and charitable person, and I'm a pacifist. I detest  violence to the highest degree. Seeing anything to do with violence  breaks my heart every single fucking time.

The  most extreme turning point (for the worse) in my life happened when I  was 20. When I was 14, I was living with my mother (she had run away  from my dad at 5), and I went to a different school. I started talking  to this girl, and after a few days, we started dating. She was my only  girlfriend ever. She played with my hair, said cute things to me, pat my  head, hugged me every time I asked to be hugged, was my first kiss,  etc. I've never been interested in anybody for sex, I've just always  wanted the cute and romantic side to it. After a week, she broke up with  me. Never told me why. I was devastated, but at the time I was also a  teenager. My mental state wasn't as badly fucked as it was when I was  20.

When I turned 17, the girl had  been in a horrible car accident, and was diagnosed with amnesia. I  found out about it when I was 20. I met her on Facebook, we started  talking, and we got along great. After about a month of that, she said  that she needed a new computer to work from home (this was the beginning  of the veerus for the United States). At first, I went to a guy that I  frequented on eBay for cheap computer parts, but he didn't have any  whole computers in stock. So me, being the absolute moron that I am,  gifted her my own gaming computer. I told her if she could drive down  here, she could have it. She came and got it the next day.

The  day after that, she messaged me on Facebook, called me a manipulative  psychopath, and blocked me on everything. In that moment, something  inside of me snapped, and my mental health tanked. It's been two years  since that happened.

I've had no  joy in my life. No friends. No family. Nothing to leave behind. I kept  searching for hope that there is one genuinely good person out there in  the world, and never found it, so after that, I went with the hope that  maybe humanity isn't *that* bad. Then.. You know what happened in the past two weeks.

This  is the final straw for me. I'm tired. I'm lonely. I'm fed up. I can't  keep hoping for humanity anymore. I'm ashamed to be a human. I don't  want to be a human. Fully positive in the fact that nobody will miss me  when I'm gone, I have started the process of purchasing a firearm  (specifically, a .45). I know that handguns create a huge mess, so I  have resolved to head to a bridge overlooking a large river, or the sea,  after midnight when nobody is around, and shoot myself, so that nobody  ever has to see my body (or if they do find my body, nobody will ever  think it was a suicide).

I don't  want sympathy. I don't want help. I don't want anybody to try to  convince me not to. I just want to vent, and I want to help others in  need. That's all I want. I know that in my final weeks, I could be  whoever I want to be, but I only want to be a kind and charitable  person. That has never changed, and it never will.

The  day before I go out, I will donate all of my money to charity, except  for $50 (in case I need money to get gas to drive to the bridge, decide I  want Subway one last time, etc).

So.. Any questions?"

Well, I stuck it out but nothing has changed. There's nothing left to live for, everything has deteriorated and I'm not talking about anything recent, this has been in the works for years. So it's over. 

And to everyone that says ""It will get better, just stick it through"". You have no idea that will happen, nothing has gone my way in life, not even in the most miniscule amount so why would it now. To be honest, I've been dead for months now, the empty shell of my body is just going through the motions. 

As far as my family, they'll just have to move on. They're just going to have to. I'm not leaving any note so they won't have an explanation, which I believe will hurt them deeply but not as much as if they knew why. Nonetheless I hope they will still love me. 

Peace y'all."

My ex partner of 1.5 years broke up with me and this was a few days after my bday and few days before Valentine’s Day. After that happened I feel like I lost a part of myself and my abandonment issues have really skyrocketed and my anxiety has just been up the roof. I’ve been seeing a therapist for about three weeks now and it has been really helping. There are still many nights where I can’t fall asleep and just think about my ex and it really doesn’t help even if he broke my heart and disrespected me at the end. I know I have to move on but I care so much for people. It controls me so much to the point that I just don’t for about an hour or so. I feel like all the people I give my all love to walk away when things get hard and I’m left to pick up the pieces and be strong by myself again. This feels more like a vent but life has just been really bad and wanting to be someone is such an urge. I tried to do some casual dating and met about three people but I didn’t wasn’t that fun tbh. I think I’m just better off learning to love myself more but I just get scared that it will take a long time or that I’m never gonna find a partner that puts the same energy towards me and doesn’t give up on me :,)"

I'm so sad and alone, I've had my childhood taken away due to abuse, my teenage years taken away due to abuse, and now here I am at 24 falling apart laying in bed all day, I can't eat because my stomach is in pain 24/7, I couldn't even do a job at target. and now everyday I feel like I don't even exist anymore. I'm venting but the only glimmer of hope is I might just might get a job at a racing museum and work there with my brother, if not I don't know what I'll do, I've been feeling suicidal lately, I think I'm losing hope and the will to live."

dbumba,2022-03-13 04:29:02+00:00,"midnightdread thoughts, writing helps them go away","The Dread 

An oily weepy cloud

Drifts into the spaces in between

It gives no warning, makes no sound

A noxious vapor green

It's poisonous and odorless 

Porous on your skin

A fog on the horizon 

A parasite settling in

The Dread creeps in your thoughts 

At the quietest time of day 

A gentle soft reminder 

That things are not ok

The Dread is never loud or mean

It's more a coaxing gnawing groan 

An existential worry 

Of everything unknown

Or maybe haunts the fear 

You're going to die alone 

A cerebral invasive species 

Mental Kudzu overgrown 

Lingered thoughts don't decompose

Plastic knives and Styrofoam 

The Dread's a subtle shift of mood 

A florescent lighting's drone

A nihilistic nagging or 

Doomscrolling on your phone 

A cirrus cloud of sadness 

A lost dog without a home 

Your insignificance compounded with

The guilt of everything you own

...Or the overwhelming om chant 

Of every mistake you ever made

And the regrets of things yet to come

Leave you paralyzed, afraid

Nothing even brought this on

You were fine a mere few minutes ago

Or maybe we just fill our days with distraction

So we don't get a chance to feel this low

The Dread creeps in unheard 

A frigid midnight snow 

Before you know it, you're buried in

And there's nowhere you can go"

NationalBreadfruit98,2022-03-12 17:01:21+00:00,"This is a long read, but I really need advice","So I'm waking up this morning feeling slightly better. By no means am I waking up and my depression just disappeared, but y'all know how some days are harder than others? Today I'm coming out of crippling anxiety and depression and making my way into just mild anxiety and depression.

Anyway, long story short, this week was rough and I need some advice on how to handle the aftermath of all of this.

I took almost a full week off work. My depression the past few days has been so severe I've rarely left my bed. But since I'm feeling a bit better, I want to get back to my usual routine and go into work tonight. I did submit a claim for FMLA which is still pending because I have yet to see a therapist/psychiatrist. The soonest appointment I could find for a psychiatrist to see me isn't until the 23rd. Nobody has signed off on my leave so it's a possibility it will get denied if the doctor I see doesn't sign off on it. 

Side note- I've taken leaves prior to this one for the same medical condition. But the 2 times prior, I was 1. Doing an out patient program for 30 days and 2. Was actually hospitalized. So this time is very different and I'm needing to actually find a regular therapist to see me. Which I currently do not have but I know I absolutely need one. 

I had a few refills from the last doctor I spoke to for a prescription of Lexapro and buspirone. I did refill those prescriptions but have yet to pick them up. Lexapro made me feel a little loopy the first few days the first time I tried it and I'm a little nervous to take it and go into work with those same side effects.

This story is getting longer than I intended.... basically what I'm asking is:
1. Should I wait to return to work until after I've seen a psychiatrist? (11 days from now)
2. What are the chances my FMLA will get denied considering I haven't been getting treatment, I've just been struggling with depression so drastically I've been incapable of leaving my bed?
3. Should I start taking meds and wait to go back to work until my mood has stabilized?
4. Should I hold off on the meds until I'm under a professionals supervision?
5. What can I do between now and my doctor's appointment to maintain my sanity?"
sadbloboftears,2022-03-12 16:46:59+00:00,Depressed but found a purpose,"I had been depressed for a couple of years after realising that I had been abused by my family physically and by a relative, for sexual assault. I was in denial for a long time. It was rough and painful. 

But I realised recently that something that’s kept me going was teaching young children. We can still all do good despite our struggles. 

If you’re giving up today, don’t lose hope. I hope you find the purpose you need one day at a time."
jlukeg,2022-03-12 14:29:05+00:00,It tells you you're alone.,"One of the most divisive things depression does is tell you that you're alone. Though you may be ""alone"" in a room by yourself or the people directly around you don't understand, you're not alone in your suffering. 

Millions are affected by this terrible thing we call depression. The more we can talk about it, the more we can share our experiences the better off we will be as humans. 

I know it feels so hard right now, like you're not sure if you'll make it through another hour let a lone a day, but YOU are proof that you can do it, that you have done it. Don't let your mind get the best of you. You matter, you matter, and you're not alone. 

I believe you can do it. One day, one hour, one minute at a time. If you do one thing today do this: say I AM ENOUGH out loud, in a mirror to yourself. You are enough. 

Keep it kind 💛"

After parties or get together with friends, when I get home I get these ideas that they hate me or like I am unwanted. Even the slightest action, like being ignored or seen makes me just hate myself for being a “loser”. And yeah, part of this feeling is from my grades, unpleasant to my eyes. I don’t really hate myself, I guess I am extremely sensitive that it’s not normal.

But today, I was driving home and I almost let it happen, I almost crashed into a car at an intersection and the fact that I didn’t even flinch or feel my heart heart rate go up, or I didn’t get that “oh shit I almost died feeling” is triggering to me.

LawrenceDigitalNomad,2022-03-12 04:05:58+00:00,"My entire life has been nothing but shit. Due to recent events of the past few weeks, I have decided to take my own life."," 

This is a decision that I am content with. I am at peace with it. I am not posting this as a cry for help, nor am I begging for attention. I am just looking for people to talk to, maybe people that can relate, or other people that suffer from depression as well. I would love to be able to help anybody else that suffers the way that I do. If I can save just one person before I pass on, it might actually make me smile for the first time in ten years.

My entire life has been nothing but shit. I was born into a family where my father was a raging alcoholic/druggie, my mother was psychotic, my grandfather was in the Klan, my grandmother was a devout Christian (moravian), and my uncle was nuts.

I was beaten at home, bullied at school, and lonely everywhere else. My grandparents knew that my father was beating me, but did nothing about it. The school knew that I was being bullied, and started saying that I had an over-active imagination and ADHD, so they could pretend that no bullying was happening in their schools. I've never had a friendship last for more than two weeks, half of the time because I never learned how to talk to people, and the other half because the other person stabbed me in the back, and cast me aside once they had no more use for me.

I have a lot of stories. I've been in a mental home, I was forced into special needs classes in an attempt to hide a bullying scandal, my dad hit me in the head with a baseball bat (and tore down my treehouse with his car, and beat our cat to death in front of me, etc etc etc), and much more.

I've always been a kind and charitable person, and I'm a pacifist. I detest violence to the highest degree. Seeing anything to do with violence breaks my heart every single fucking time.

The most extreme turning point (for the worse) in my life happened when I was 20. When I was 14, I was living with my mother (she had run away from my dad at 5), and I went to a different school. I started talking to this girl, and after a few days, we started dating. She was my only girlfriend ever. She played with my hair, said cute things to me, pat my head, hugged me every time I asked to be hugged, was my first kiss, etc. I've never been interested in anybody for sex, I've just always wanted the cute and romantic side to it. After a week, she broke up with me. Never told me why. I was devastated, but at the time I was also a teenager. My mental state wasn't as badly fucked as it was when I was 20.

When I turned 17, the girl had been in a horrible car accident, and was diagnosed with amnesia. I found out about it when I was 20. I met her on Facebook, we started talking, and we got along great. After about a month of that, she said that she needed a new computer to work from home (this was the beginning of the veerus for the United States). At first, I went to a guy that I frequented on eBay for cheap computer parts, but he didn't have any whole computers in stock. So me, being the absolute moron that I am, gifted her my own gaming computer. I told her if she could drive down here, she could have it. She came and got it the next day.

The day after that, she messaged me on Facebook, called me a manipulative psychopath, and blocked me on everything. In that moment, something inside of me snapped, and my mental health tanked. It's been two years since that happened.

I've had no joy in my life. No friends. No family. Nothing to leave behind. I kept searching for hope that there is one genuinely good person out there in the world, and never found it, so after that, I went with the hope that maybe humanity isn't *that* bad. Then.. You know what happened in the past two weeks.

This is the final straw for me. I'm tired. I'm lonely. I'm fed up. I can't keep hoping for humanity anymore. I'm ashamed to be a human. I don't want to be a human. Fully positive in the fact that nobody will miss me when I'm gone, I have started the process of purchasing a firearm (specifically, a .45). I know that handguns create a huge mess, so I have resolved to head to a bridge overlooking a large river, or the sea, after midnight when nobody is around, and shoot myself, so that nobody ever has to see my body (or if they do find my body, nobody will ever think it was a suicide).

I don't want sympathy. I don't want help. I don't want anybody to try to convince me not to. I just want to vent, and I want to help others in need. That's all I want. I know that in my final weeks, I could be whoever I want to be, but I only want to be a kind and charitable person. That has never changed, and it never will.

The day before I go out, I will donate all of my money to charity, except for $50 (in case I need money to get gas to drive to the bridge, decide I want Subway one last time, etc).

So.. Any questions?"
AstridRoalsvik,2022-03-12 02:04:50+00:00,in a dark place,"I'm in a dark place right now. I haven't felt suicidal or like self harming in a long time. But tonight I keep thinking about cutting or taking all my pills before I go to sleep. I'm sure it will pass, but it all feels so hard right now. My health hasn't been great but the doctors don't know what's wrong so I have a huge medical bill and nothing to show for it. My savings is practically gone due to other bills too. I was planning to visit family this summer but there again, money, and my mom played pity party about some things making me feel terrible. She is showing early signs of Alzheimer's so I'm trying to be patient. But I also didn't even get a card or a phone call from my family on my birthday so being treated like that felt even worse. I've told them about my health concerns and procedures too and they don't even check up on me.
It's all so woe is me to say. And sometimes it's not a big deal, I just move on. But it's hitting hard right now. Everyone has shit going on I try to help with, but then I feel forgotten. But I don't want anyone else to feel that way, so I keep going!
My toddler has been my readon for living. But I almost feel she is better off without me too.
I wish I could confide all that to someone but I don't know who. My husband won't listen. He acts like a child sometimes and again, I handle everything with little acknowledgment. Not always, but sometimes.
I try to be strong but tonight I just want to give up."

Why is it so bad, why does it have to be this way. I mean everything, the backwards political landscape and the mental gymnastics people take to....what? Make things better for others, why doesn't that ever fucking happen, how can the world fail at so many angles.
It's not fair, I understand that much, but why? It doesn't make sense and I can't stop thinking about how shitty people are treated. Then I hate myself for being in a privaleged life that I didn't earn and do not deserve. There is 100% someone out there who could use my resources for something better, but it doesn't work like that.

Everyone knows this is stupid, everyone just wants their piece on the chessboard to be successful, they will sacrifice other pieces for power. Some (the ones with power mostly) are quite obvious about being evil and no one does a thing.

Life is sad, very sad, I don't know how much sadder it could get. If there was a solution why has no-one found it, personal greed? Is that it. Things are either getting worse or we're just being informed of it more via the internet.

Why, why does it have to be like this. I know this makes no sense but mainly wanted to rant since my brain won't stop bloody thinking about it. People are stupid including me, I keep hping science will come up with some magical cure. But it's a long time to wait and I'm not enjoying it. It would literally just take this sub of 87k people to revolt against an entire country. 

Theres like 50K (tops) people who are supposed to be governing, they wouldn't fight back either, they'd just use pawns. Also we just cannot get organized. They just use pawns like the army etc, but if they revolted too (or just convinced some others to not get in the way), we could change things.. 

tldr; Things are just WRONG, people don't give a shit. It's all dogs on instagram and cute outfits, this is our world now and it's in a pityful state."
NC67NH,2022-03-11 20:19:50+00:00,I don't know anymore.,"Hello.

I am 23 and a 4th-year medical student. Lately, I have been feeling awfully depressed. But before I go on, I would like to mention that I am not and never have been diagnosed with depression and anything I say here is purely from my perspective. 

A little bit of background first is, I think, appropriate. All was fine until I joined medical school. This is not to say that medical school is the source of all my problems though. In high school, I was what you would call a socially-awkward kid. In some situations, I just say some stupid stuff and end up looking like I have a foot in my mouth. But after high school, that's when things started to slowly take a turn for the worst. I'm not a person that handles stress very well. So, I started to delve into things like porn, for example, and massive hours of procrastination to try and get away from it all. That has definitely made things worse, especially the porn. I don't have a massive problem with it. I feel the urge to watch it almost weekly now but whenever I do, boy is it painful! I feel like absolute shit and just want to stay in my room and not talk to anybody and I become mean to whoever tries to do so. This led to me failing in my first year of medical school because I just gave up for a few months then.    

I have felt like this for a few years now, but it has been getting a lot worse over the past few months. I have gotten to a point where I get so anxious in social situations that I can't even speak properly anymore. This has led people around me, including my close friends, to lose respect for me. I feel that's the case anyway. Whenever we are hanging out, it's like they act as if I'm not even there and I'm afraid to speak to them about anything because I get way too anxious for fear that I might say something stupid and get laughed at and lose their respect even more. Trust me, this has happened all too often.  More days than not, I feel absolutely worthless and now I'm starting to feel bad for the people close to me for being stuck with me. Now, I just don't want to see my friends and family anymore. It's just too stressful. Add this to the stress of being in medical school, it becomes crippling. I can't even remember much of what I learned over the past 4 years or so because I'm just constantly stressed. I have a month off from school at the moment so, if you've got any advice on how I should proceed, please, it will be much appreciated."

I’m nearing 30 years old and I feel so lost in my social life. That is to say I have none. I don’t have friends, I don’t go out on my free-time, I tend to stay away from social gatherings and even grocery shopping takes a lot out of me. The only people I talk to is my co workers when I am at work and my parents every now and again. The thought of “going to new places and meeting people” is enough to leave me parallelized in bed. I hate when I mention “loneliness” that the first couple of responses is always on the line of “well then go out and meet people”. I feel like I’m just a burden and creep when I’m out. Why would I approach a group when they already have their friends and place within that friendship. Why would anyone consider taking me into a part of their social group?


I work out ( I have a home gym), try to eat right and spend my time reading and trying to learn new things. I live in a small town in Maine so I don’t have any opportunities  to “join clubs”, “enjoy the nightlife”, or any other activities others suggest to meet new people. And even if I was afforded such chances the idea of “meeting new people” on my own is terrifying. I’m short and awkward. I don’t understand many of the social norms and unwritten rules that others follows. And since I’m not a hunter,fisher, or partake in “beefing up” my vehicle or go “offroading” I find myself lurking through online libraries and watching YouTube all day. 



When I do manage to muster the energy and will to go for a walk around my town I find it so hard to even look up from the ground and wave and say hello to someone passing me by. I always make it a point to not make eye contact and move quickly pass them. It’s frustrating on one end I’m scared to make contact with somebody else and therefore I do my best to stay alone but I do such a good job of it that the social isolation is slowly killing me. 



I just don’t know what else or where else to go. I hate people and yet I want to have at least one friend. I feel so depressed lately and its been getting worse and worse. I don’t want to go back to therapy. After nearly 10 years I’ve pretty much heard it all and done what I can do improve my position in life and yet I’m still in the same spot. My anxiety and paranoia leaves me in a lonely spot. I am starting to hate my life and everyday is becoming the same routine to the point that work is the only way I can tell my days apart. I had  girlfriend two years ago but that ended with her going back to her ex and leaving me a wreck. I refuse to use social media because I am an extremely private person. I uphold privacy in the highest regard to the point where I feel as if it’s affecting my life in a negative way. I just don’t know to to make and maintain relationships in general. 



I need help but I’m not sure in what form and how to get it. I want to feel normal or maybe I’m just cursed to be lonely and fighting off these depressive thoughts. I just want a friend or for someone to point me in the right direction. Maybe I’m autistic, maybe I’m an incel and I just never knew. I just wish I knew what the hell is wrong with me so I can feel a tad bit better. 


If anyone does read this please help. I just don’t know what to do any more. All I know I can’t keep going on like this."

LawrenceDigitalNomad,2022-03-11 05:04:06+00:00,I've finally become at peace with leaving this world behind.,"(Pre-Context: This is not a cry for help. This is not me seeking attention. I just want somebody to talk to. I also hope that people relating to this post can comment, and that I can help them through dark times while I'm still here.)

(22, living in the United States.)

My life has always, and will always be shit. I was born to a drunken, abusive father, a psychotic mother, an insane uncle, grandfather in the KKK, and an overzealous grandmother.

I was heavily bullied at school, heavily abused at home, and always felt lost wherever I went.

Whenever I was around 7-8, I started noticing that everything was getting harder than it already had been. I had less energy, I didn't laugh as much as I used to, and other sorts of hints. As the months went on, it got worse and worse, so I went for tests, and was officially diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) at the age of 9.

After that, life only got worse. I've never been able to hold a friendship for more than two weeks, half of it being because I never really learned how to talk to people, and the other half being that the people I was kind and charitable to, took advantage of me, and used me until I had nothing left to offer them.

I had one girlfriend in my entire life. We dated for a week when I was 14, and then we just broke it off. I don't even remember why, but she came up to me a week later and basically told me to get fucked.

When I was 20, I had found out that she had been in a terrible car accident when I was 17, and lost her memory. I found her on Facebook, and we got along great. I wasn't happy, but.. I started to feel again.

Anyway, one month passes, and she has to work from home, as this is the start of the (veerus). At first, I went online to find her a cheap computer - I knew a guy that sold entry-level gaming PCs and laptops for cheap, but he was out of stock at the time, so me, being the idiot that I am, gifted her my gaming computer, so that she wouldn't lose her job.

The very next day, she messaged me on Facebook, told me that I was a manipulative psychopath, and blocked me on everything.

That was the last straw. My mental state regarding my depression had already been on the decline, but once that happened, it nosedived. I became a recluse, I didn't talk to people unless I absolutely had to (i.e. at work). It's gotten so bad to the point where I'm constantly sick because of the stress.

The final straw was.. Well.. The events of the past few weeks. Because of that, I can never view humanity the same way again. I had been hanging on to hope for over a decade, hoping that I could find one good person in the world, or that humanity 'wasn't that bad'. Then.. All of this happened. I can never view humanity the same way again. I'll never be able to. Because of that, I have decided that it's time.

Now, it's not going to happen tonight, this week, or maybe even this month. I have decided to purchase a handgun. After posting questions across Reddit about which caliber is the best for the job - and using a browser extension to clear all of my posts and comments, I have discovered that the best tool for the job is a .45, so this is what I will be going for.

I have a clean record, so if I have to take a concealed carry course to purchase a handgun, I will. It won't cost much, I can afford it. The question is how long it will take.

(Post-Context: Please don't try to talk me out of it. This is not me looking for any other solutions, I just genuinely want to talk. It can be about anything, so long as we're not trying to change my mind. If anybody comments on this about depression or related illnesses, I am more than happy to help while I'm still here.)

(There is TONS of things that I left out \[this post would be 100,000 characters long\], such as the abuse I suffered at the hands of my father, how my school pretended I had an over-active imagination and was never bullied, etc, but I won't get into all of that here.)

**Have a good night.**"

cinnamong99,2022-03-11 01:39:05+00:00,march 19th is the day 💗,"my last day on earth. and i’m serious. it’s fucking *terrifying*, the thought of the rope breaking, brain damage, being punished in an afterlife, or reincarnated. it’s all so so horrific and scary. but i am at the point where the risk of those is worth it because there is also a chance i will find relief with death. i’m really scared, i don’t want to be so hopeless that this is the only option, but it’s been years and it honestly is. i can’t keep fighting. we all die in the end, i just want the end to come sooner. 

i wish i didn’t have to do it myself but i guess for once it’s something i can control. i have a $200 hotel room booked (i’ll leave a note outside the bathroom so nobody has to be traumatized by seeing my body), i’ve been there before the perfect place to do hanging. and i already paid for the room so if anything it’s even more motivation to go through with it. i have had a rope around my neck before and the perfect opportunity about a year ago and for some reason i couldn’t make myself do it, but everything gotten even worse since then. 

i don’t want to back out. i wish i had a friend to do it with me, i don’t want to leave alone. and i wish people would support me in my decision rather than telling me to keep going. there is NO reason to stay alive. i’m exhausted and i can’t do this anymore."
Pickleface32,2022-03-11 00:02:17+00:00,Feeling like a failure at 34.,"I just don't like being around people more successful than me in income, social status, family, etc.

I am a lone wolf. Suffered from abuse and neglect since my mom died when I was 3. I don't want to be alive, but I just push through the days. I've suffer from terrible acne with no hope in getting rid of the appearance of pores. I don't like seeing everyone else but me decent looking. I get so down being born with autism and a brother who is mentally challenged. Life is extremely unfair and to make matters worse, I suffer from temporomandibular joint dysfunction. I've tried therapists, meditations are unreasonably expensive in the US. I kind of believe if a life has been wasted being stuck in depression at age 50-75, people should have the right to terminate their life rather than suffer a sad lonely life.  Sure I sound like a negative ned, but if you had some mental health issues in a world that lacks adequate resources unless you're rich, you would be too."

What did you do today? How many hours have i spent, nether truly here nor truly there. Just frozen. Wanting desparately to begin anything. Get up and shower or work out or drink water or make a change or dance along or be a person - just get up. My insides, coating edges of blank atrophy. How hard can it truly be? People do this every day. They make their life every day. Why can't i? Why am i stuck here? Why am i stuck like this, with only my heart and no beat? The shifting warning - you need to start swimming. You can't always just float. But what else, when my limbs don't move and there's no sound for the breach of my throat? What else, and where am i going? What shore am i supposed to even be wading out for? Nothing and nothing and nothing. The swinging, empty bridge, and no railling."

I mean, there’s like two or three, but they’re only around because they need something from me. I have nobody around me, except for my real family that wants to be around me, for something unconditional. I don’t have anyone that genuinely enjoys my company. About five years ago, I had many more friends. I don’t know if they were real, but they were around nonetheless. Now, barely any. What went wrong?"
LostSoul11111,2022-03-10 20:23:56+00:00,"When it’s not sadness anymore, the person I was is dead","I just needed too write this, things are so lonely. And I am tired. I am already dead, I just exist . can’t be happy or kind to myself. I have always struggled with social codes and with myself, because of my adhd and autism.  before I could laugh, I had friends and I was an extroverted person. I struggled with a deep sadness. But for the last 3 years it’s been deeper. I have become so afraid of myself and my mind. The voices tells me not too eat or my medication, and tells me I don’t deserve too be happy. And that I can’t go out and be with other people because iam an psychopath. I sit in my room day after day, and speak less less with other people. And I am always afraid. I cry everyday, and it feels like I live in an déjà vu or an limbo. I just don’t understand why I born? I just bug people, and steal their energy. 
3 year of isolation has killed my soul. I don’t know how too make new friends, talk too people without being scared. And I don’t know if I can ever get myself out of my limbo.  I want love, hugs and a person to take care of me and make me feel safe :("
agreatbigfailure,2022-03-10 19:48:23+00:00,Looking forward to death,"So for about five years I’ve been extremely depressed, anxious, suicidal OCD , bipolar you name it I’ve been suffering with quite a lot. 

My life is nothing but difficult I have no skills or natural talents I’m not good looking either I’m basically useless. I have no aspirations and I don’t enjoy anything about the human condition as we are expected to just put up with, for example school, clubbing ,drinking, competing with other people For example in the corporate world or money or external appearances all pointless social interactions , buying materialistic goods I just don’t care about that stuff at all anymore it all repulses me. 

I feel like any certain people are made to succeed in the world with its current conditions and mentally this world is so unbelievably suffocating and soul crushing to me I just can’t bear it like I’m not able to take on life honestly I look forward to death. I only look forward to sleeping and Regularly wish I would never wake up in the morning when I fall asleep I feel so peaceful on my mind and soul feels free of all that hurts me in this world. I wish I was never here and I feel stuck Like my dad is not on the scene my mum is a difficult character .  It’s awful feeling like your guilt tripped to stay here, if I had no parents I would definitely kill myself a long time ago but because one of my parents do I feel like I’m in imprisoned.

Have you ever felt this way ? have you ever been able to overcome these feelings and if you did how did you overcome this mindset?"
andelanov,2022-03-10 19:27:04+00:00,My libido it's getting really LOW,"I have always living with anxiety and stress, others times with depression. Lately i been really sad and anxious bc a health problem that makes my self esteem lower, college and other stuffs. I have a boyfriend, he is amazing, he really loves me and cares about me, tells me that he loves me everyday, nothing like i ever experienced before. I always had a normal sexual life, sometimes when i'm alone like every other normal human,  i touch myself, my libido has been always normal for my age. Since i get more depressed, i started to notice that i am not attracted that much to sexual moments with my boyfriend, and even sometimes (but less) with myself. It's been like this for over a month. We used to have our sexual moments every weekend, sometimes week too. Now sometimes when he wants to have intimacy, i get sleepy, or i try, but in just a couple of minutes i get distracted or not in the mood anymore. I don't like this, i don't like that my anxiety, stress and sadness it's getting in my sexual life. Now i don't have real intimacy since 3 weeks or more (with a boyfriend/girlfriend isn't very common). I want to have my normal libido back, i want to have intimate nights with candles and massages with my boyfriend again, but i think my mental health has started to possess this part of my life, and i hate it, and my worried that my boyfriend may dislike this. I have talk to him about this, he understands and doesn't pressure me, which its good, but i'm not enjoying this, and i know he won't one day either. We just to barely watch tv when we watched bc all the passion i felt, but know i get sleepy or i don't want to do it. Does anybody experienced something like this?"

Aidens_curse,2022-03-10 06:05:29+00:00,Feeling nothing but pain and misery even nothing is wrong,"Depression has given me happiness and sorrow. I keep wanting to hurt myself even when I feel better at times 😔. I have people who love me, but I still hurt them and I'm still young. I have had depression since I was about 7 or so and my mother was the only real parent that I had who could make decisions for me but she was hardly around mentally and now she is nowhere to be found mentally and physically. I lost hope because of the way I was treated and it hurts. I found someone to love and yet I want to hurt them because I am cruel and filled with pain. Even now I feel I have nothing to live for but I know I do and it's completely tearing me apart. Some days I do feel good enough to even get myself to eat a full meal but it's still inconsistent. I want to constantly feel sad and hurt myself and others. I know other people do feel the same as me but depression really does cause too many problems and it is probably the most deadly thing for humans if not treated. I urge everyone to seek help if possible as will. You are not alone."

I haven't really had friends since middle school and they weren't exactly great. I'm shy. It's hard to talk to people. I'm trying to work on myself, put myself out there and be more confident. And I did... and it blew up in my face and now I don't know what to do. I was so excited and now there's nothing to look forward to. I know it's small.

things being absent i can barely talk to boys or girls. i can barely order or checkout anything without struggling. Middle School i did a lot of gym and i got healthier but i still felt horrible the whole time. tell you what trying to match up with people was such a crash course in gym class because all of us were hormoned as fuck. Due to recent events i am very unsure if i even have a future at all. 

i live around and have blue collar types who were the pull yourself by the bootstraps types and i really look up to them but i have many conflictions from different parts of society. i wish i could be a proper man but currently i am a depressed anxious wreck. i only ever feel worthy of anything if i produce something of use and value or kill my body and mind. honestly i just feel hopeless and while idk if this is the best sub to vent about my Man issues it really does effect my outlooks and feelings on life."
LynnFox,2022-03-10 00:56:38+00:00,I googled toxic plants and feel better now,"I had a bad day today, lots of crying and self-pity. Don't really know what triggered it but I probably just needed a quick break mental down. Yay. 

One of my big issues is my declining physical health. I'll probably be in a wheelchair in 10, at most 15 years. And it's going to be a long and painful demise. I'll talk about it in therapy soon, so maybe I'll find a little more hope for me there (finally found a new therapist).

But for now it brings me peace that there are easy ways to go once I can't take the pain and suffering anymore. I'll probably be on opiates in a foreseeable future and knowing there's other ways out helps me calm down.

I'm not suicidal, I can do life for a good while longer. But I can't do it forever."

LawrenceDigitalNomad,2022-03-10 00:19:15+00:00,I've finally gathered up the courage to commit suicide.," 

My life has always been shit, and it's gradually gotten worse since I was 9.

Now  that I've seen what's going on with Ukraine, I'm never going to see  humanity again. I've struggled through MDD for 9 years (I'm 22 now), and  I've held on for the hope that I found find just one good person. Now  that Russia is bombing children's hospitals.. I'm tired. I'm too tired  to do this shit anymore.

I'm not  sure what the process is for purchasing a firearm, but I'm sure it can't  be that hard, as I don't have a criminal record. If I have to purchase a  concealed carry license, I'll do so and take a weekend class for it.  After asking several people, it seems that the cheapest option - while  still being effective - is a .45, so that's what I'm going for.

Talking  about things helps me feel better, so that's why I'm doing this post. Not  sure when I'll get my hands on a handgun, but as soon as I do, nobody  can stop me.

This isn't a cry for  help, this isn't me reaching out, this isn't any of that. I'm tired. I'm  lonely. I'm fed up. Every single one of my hopes have been dashed. I've  never had a friendship last for more than two weeks. I've never had any  real family. I've never had any hope in humanity, and I've never been  given a reason to have hope.

The  hour before I off myself, I will donate all of my money to Ukrainian  charities, so that hopefully, my money can help save at least one life.  If I give my life for another, maybe I would finally smile right before I  pass, as I haven't truly smiled since I was 12."

I don’t remember my teen years much. I don’t remember the last 3 years much. Sometimes I don’t even remember the previous day(s).

Brilliant-Trifle8322,2022-03-09 21:00:32+00:00,Have you ever purposefully avoided people because you feel you'll drag them into your depression?,"I've always been somewhat lonely but generally try to avoid people as much as possible, for 3 main reasons:

1. I have trust issues, been betrayed and let down so often by people that I constantly have my guard up nowadays.
2. The effort and time required to maintain friendships is often just too exhausting for me.
3. I feel like even if I did try to reach out to others, I'd just drag them into my own misery anyway.

I've occasionally browsed subs like r/Needafriend, but have never once replied to any of the posts even if I come across one, read it in full and think we could get along. I seem to have had a severe case of the hedgehog dilemma going on my entire life, but even aside from that, I don't want to get others involved in my own depression and life issues, even if I never bring them up intentionally, I know my own behaviour and personality is often heavily influenced by my mental health, so it's bound to crop up in some form or other. I've ended up ghosting people over this before as well.

Does anyone else ever feel like this?"

A girl my age should have had a bf or husband instead I just feel like a pos I fucking hate myself to be purely honest with you all. I find relief in saying that. I have always been love bombed growing up so I think it'd great for me to remind myself how shitty of a person I actually am. I'm okay with the verdict because I realize it's truth. I just feel dead and weak. Legit my mind is off my heartbeat is gone I just feel like I'm this phantom living inside of a grey realm composed of misery, torment, pain, and hostility. There is no comfort for me there is no peace there is no light at the end of the tunnel it seems. I am just bound to this life of suffering and I can't take my own life because I have fear so I'm constantly running ideas in my mind of how to find ease within the existence of this disease.

He got severely depressed and stopped contacting me, even his parents, friends everyone. He spent there around 3 years and didn't complete his studies. He used to just stayed at home and sleep. I and his family tried to convince him to return home and start a new for one year. After one year of several tries he finally came home in 2021. Its been one year after he came back but his situation didn't improve at all. He doesn't want to do anything.He basically sleeps all day and night and smokes.He doesn't even eat properly.Only a meal a day! We tried to seek medical help but he doesn't want to go to therapist and when we ask the reason he doesn't even respond. Its become super hard to communicate with him because he just shuts himself and become so emotionless that sometimes I really can't get what should I say. I tried to stay with him and bear this situation for 4 years, hoping that it will get better some day. But I am seeing dead end and its affecting my mental health. Currently I try to go out and have fun with him, but all I can sense is tension and negative energy. I am a very free spirited girl who likes to travel, paint, reading books but now I don't find good vibe from anything. I all the time find myself worrying about him. Am I loosing myself too? -I often ask myself. I really love him and he is the most closest person in my life. I am really thankful to all the memories I made with him and when he is not depressed he is a really caring and most understanding boyfriend who always cheer for my little little success, who knows me more than anyone. I can't imagine my life without him but I just can't take this mental stress on me anymore. I am preparing for my PhD and I find myself in great mess balancing my personal life, work life and my mental peace. My family also want me to move on and find someone new. But I feel guilty and selfish to do that and at the same time I just can't think my life without him. what should I do?"

I've absolutely zero social skills, never gone out of the house unless its a must. No one likes me because of my boring personality and that results in having no friends at all. No talent whatsoever. Can't seem to progress once I reach my limit. I can't even get decent at every possible thing. No matter how hard I try or how long I persist I can never get past being mediocre. I've tried for days, months, years, still no improvement. People seem to get progressively better and better while I'm here stuck, alone. Wtf is this? Why am I so freaking hopeless? All I ask for is having the ability to be good at an area of interest. Is it really that hard? Even writing this takes a lot of mental effort. Can't write a decent essay either. It just takes so so so much more effort to be on the same level as others who can do it easily. My life is f**ked up at this point. Probably the most useless being ever. If you were in my shoes, you'll probably prefer to not exist. That's how frustrating it is. Fml."

It is currently 6 am and I can’t sleep. This is because I have so much anxiety and depression over my body dysmorphia that is a result of me not being to be able to go to a gym for 16 months (3-20 to 9-21) due to Covid. I was a seinor in HS when Covid began and was going to the gym as an athlete, but over quarantine, my parents didn’t let me go to the gym and I did shitty home workouts. Now 6 months back, I have improved, but so much time and progress lost. I can feel the consequences of my underwheleming progress from 2 years ago every day because I’m a loner in college with nothing tk be proud of. I regret not trying harder to convince my parents at the start of 2021 to let me in the gym, they just got really mad when I asked. I am very sad and I can not get over this, it has been on my mind for many months. Has it affected anyone here else like it has affected me?"

White_Circle,2022-03-09 05:40:58+00:00,"This to my favorite band and why I like it, I know if it belongs here.","I Imagine Dragons

I imagine dragons, I imagine dragons in my head. I imagine dragons around my neck like a rope that cut off for my weight. I imagine dragons shape as the cuts I made in my wrist. I imagine dragons will come and take my life from me like those cars I stand in front of when crossing the street. People around me have always mucked me because I like Imagen Dragons music, the band is not that cool or dark enough to be great. Without paying attention the band seems like a happy song, the musical ladder doesn't sound like a broken window, the singer doesn't look like an addict does. I feel like one of those songs that I listen all the time, music that doesn't sound like pain, yet if you pay attention to it you could see the sadness, the pain, the lack of will for life. Every night I'm giving up, I feel dull knives cutting thru my skin and can't stop it. I imagine dragons are shaped like the scars I have made to myself. I'm bleeding out and I feel tire of pushing myself to something that it's not there, I can't evolve into what I wish I could be, I'm falling apart. I don't recognize this hands that hold the knife against my skin, I don't recognize this eyes that don't seem to fine happiness. People tell me the band is a feel good band, that they don't play real music, but in the lyrics of my soul you can find the words of Dan, impregnated with the sadness I find. People around me haven't noticed that I'm walking the wire and I'm about to lose my balance, the last thing I'll do is bring everyone down. Can nobody hear me, I'm dancing in the dark with a rope around my  neck and I cannot breathe, feeding the darkness my innocence is gone, faith is a curse. Can nobody notice I'm crying for help, I cannot take it in, I'm counting my sins and crying in my sleep. I wish I could point a bullet in a gun to my heart, I don't mind death. Pleas don't come close, it's dark inside and the blood runs stale, but I don't wanna let you down, my demons got a hold on me, all I have left is fear. I get lonely even with people all around me. I'll do whatever it takes, please, I'm so sorry, my ragged sleep has washed my dreams away, and left a hopeless empty space. This problem lies on me, a monster that keeps getting stronger, stuck in my head with the power of a thousand warriors, I'm begging the pain to leave me. The happiness within my heart is made of smoke and mirrors and that's all I have, I have to live my life while my blood is boiling, I have to keep pushing to this side of me that wants to grow older, this side has to be the warrior, the kid's scared and wants it all to be over. 
To the rope around my neck. 
I bet my life on you, I'm a bad liar and can't keep pretending. Don't be afraid, look how far we've come and I won't blame you if you turn and go. There's nothing left to say now, I'm giving up, we are done tip-toing in our head, hopefully you'll believe in second chances and levitate me away from my night visions, far from my sad origins without forgetting my roots. If not and it's time, here at top of the world I'm ready to release myself to the bottom of the pit, I'm never changing who I am and I'm drowning on the waters of my soul, where do we go from it's up to you.

bonkybonk001,2022-03-09 05:31:05+00:00,I'm so tired,"I'm so fucking tired. I just want to sleep and never wake up. 
I don't know how I ended up like this.
It's so hard living like this, it doesn't seem to get better. 
I hate college, can't understand a thing, don't even try studying and end up feeling guilty all the time for not studying. I don't really have many friends. The few I had, have gone to different colleges after highschool. 
I haven't made any friends here and my second year ie about to end.
We had our offline exams for the first time since pandemic and I did really bad. I can't tell my parents how bad I scored. I'm so ashamed of myself.
I started cutting in between and it somehow made me feel a little better. I could punish myself that way for not studying, it helped to lessen the guilt a bit. 
There was only one cutter and now somehow it's edge has gotten blunt and it doesn't cut anymore.

I went out with this friend from school yesterday, she was with her friends from college and it was such a good day, we went for a movie, ate outside. And today I feel like shit again for not studying and going out. And feel like I didn't deserve it. It was one of the best days I have had in a very long time. My parents usually don't let me go out. I'm home all the time. The only time I go out is for college. The whole travelling takes 3 hours daily and I get so tired when I reach home that I sometimes skip dinner and sleep. Then I have to wake up early the next day for catching the bus. 

I have all the basic necessities, a comfortable life but I feel like shit. I know there are people struggling so much for even basic things. I don't deserve any of this. I really wish I could swap my life with someone who really needs it, I'm a waste of everything. 

I'm studying cse currently, but I'm so fucking dumb, I can't understand anything. I'm not even interested in this. I want everything to end. 
I'm so tired
There's so much anxiety 
I can't even express how I feel properly

I have thought of running away so many times, I don't know what I'll do. Maybe starve myself to death, have a slow suffering death. 

I can't even walk alone without telling myself it's okay it's okay, almost over. I feel everyone's staring at me and I'm not walking properly. 
I get crying urges out of nowhere. I don't have any friends in class.
My life is so shit. Therapy was shit.
I told my parents once , that I was depressed. They got angry at me. Said I was making excuses for not studying, took my phone away. It didn't help.

There's not a day when I wake up feeling good or I am happy. Everyday is shit. Buy yesterday was really really nice, I felt so normal. 

I'm sitting at the library rn. All I want to do is cry and sleep. I didn't attend any classes today.
This isn't even properly formatted, I dont even know how to write. I'm good at nothing I should die. Fucking retard
My parents are going to be so disgusted by me, not like they are any proud of me rn
They expected me to score good. I couldn't do anything in jee. I thought I was going to fail in the boards but I got 83 % .no idea how. I was very satisfied with it but my parents weren't

I can't talk to people about my emotions and hate it when people get attached

I want to die everything sucks

It hurts so much sometimes but there's nothing I can do

I have talked anonymously, texted people discussing my emotions but after a certain point it does t help


I have thought so much about dying, even tried it few years ago, more than once. It doesn't work.
I want to end everything, I feel like I'm too tired to carry on but then I also don't really want it to end

I don't know what I want"

LawrenceDigitalNomad,2022-03-09 04:19:46+00:00,"My life is over, and it never even began.","For reference, 22 in the United States.  I've had an awful childhood. Abusive father, manic mother, crazy uncle, race-ist (to say the least) grandfather and highly religious grandmother. I was heavily bullied at school, and the schools swept it under the rug, or said that I was making it all up. 

I was diagnosed with MDD at 9, severe anxiety at 12 and PTSD at 17.  I've never had a friendship last for longer than two weeks, and that's half of my own fault, because I've never learned how to make friends or even talk to people, and half because the people I thought were my friends ended up stabbing me in the back.  I've had one girlfriend in my entire life. I'm asexual, but I've always wanted something romantic. Somebody I could buy flowers for, or make breakfast in bed for when they're sick. She was my girlfriend for one week when I was 14, and we broke it off.  


When I was 20, I learned that she had been in a terrible car accident when I was 17, and she had lost her memory. I found her on Facebook, and we got along great.  A month later, because of the veerus (saying the word gets the post autoblocked), she had to work from home. I gave her my gaming computer, so that she could work from home. I did try to find her a cheap computer from a source on eBay I used, but they were out of stock at the time.  The very next day, she messaged me saying I was a manipulative piece of shit, and that I needed serious mental help. Then she blocked me on everything. 


That was really the last straw. Ever since then, I've become nothing more than a wrathful and vengeful asshole, that has no patience, or even any energy to negotiate or debate with anybody. People terrify me, and I can't even play games multiplayer without being all nervous.  It's been almost two whole years since I started turning from a kind and charitable kid, to a full-blown bastard. I don't even try to be - I don't hate humanity, I'm not a psychopath, I'm just too afraid and too sick of people to care anymore.  

I've come to accept that my life is never going to get any better, and that I'm only going to go more crazy as time goes on, so I've finally resolved to do something about it.  When I get home from work today, I'm going to start looking for a weapon. I have the money for it, but I don't know where to start. I do however know how to use the Google and browse the interwebs, so it can't be that hard. If I need to have a carry license to purchase one, or anything like that, I can take a course on the weekends. I've not had a goal that I can actually work towards in so long, so I've finally set a goal for myself, that hopefully will take less than a month. 


My goal is to pass on, as painlessly as possible."

Sorry for weird formatting lol

Ok so I stupidly s/h’d on my neck so I put a band-aid on it and went to school. It’s the beginning of the day where we have 30~ mins to do whatever before the bell. Me, childhood friend (who I’ll call Beth for a fake name), and Beth’s bf (who I’ve been good friends with before they even started dating and am still a good friend with) usually hang out in our favorite teacher’s class until the bell. We’re having some banter (if that is how you use that word) and the following convo ensues

Beth’s bf: “Why do you have a band-aid on your neck?”

Beth: “Where?”

Bf: * points to band-aid *

Beth: * to me * “Where did that come from?”

Me: “It was just a cut”

Beth: “Did ***you*** do that?”

Me: “It’s just a cut”


[Insert her just asking if I did it and me saying it’s a cut x10] Bruh. How?!? I’ve never alluded to being mentally unwell at all and I don’t have a history of it so how did she know?! Anyways, in the next class I have with her she asked if she was paler than me (which I doubted because I’m one of the palest kids in the school and I’ve never seen her as pale) then proceeded to ask me to compare arms. This bitch knew what she was doing. After I showed her my ‘dominate’ arm (right arm) she asked to see my left one (where scars would be if i had s/h’d on my arms(my s/h scars are on my thighs smh)). I swear she knew what she was doing. In the next class, my last class, Beth’s bf was in there and I sat next him like I usually do cuz we’re friends and all. Class goes by with him only asking once about the band-aid and I told him to shut up cuz we were supposed to be quiet. Then at dismissal he asked me again but more seriously. Then later I said “I’m so stupid, this shit is gonna send me to the mental ward” under my breath and for once in this bitch’s goddamn life he understood me perfectly. ***HE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO NEVER HEAR THINGS RIGHT, WTF?!*** Luckily, he’s a chill guy so he just murmurs “*so you diiidddddd do it yourself..!*” My instant response was a very calm  and not at all stressed ^(/s) “**shit.**” We laugh it off and leave for my club not even a minute later. But bro, this shit stressful af. I just needed to get this off of my chest, thanks for reading!"

But recently, I've been just jerking off and not telling him because I understand the need of sex, but I don't want to be penetrated and that's all he wants because he claims it makes him ""feel closer and intimate"". And he said he doesn't want to be with anyone who doesn't want to have sex, and unfortunately that's currently me. And I don't know why, and I feel like we're going to break up now, or that I'm better off alone because I just can't have sex with him anymore. I would rather be at work than at home now, I'd rather be in class than at home with him, I don't want to be at home because I'm always anticipating a ""can we have anal sex?"".

Sorry for the odd format.

These dark thoughts have been with me for a long time but they’ve been getting darker. I gave up on my dreams since they keep getting derailed. I suppressed them with my feelings and wore a mask for many years. I locked my personality away to fit in.
My path was never my choice but I sacrificed everything to get to the highest peak. 
I was told if I met all these ‘requirements of life’, I’d get a chance to do what I want. That was my initial hope and motivated me for many years.
However, I no longer  remember what I wanted to do next. What did I want? 
Empty and obedient.

Here I am now, the top 10% of my cohort and just about to graduate. I have the iron rice bowl and now I theoretically have the most freedom within my job scope.  I feel so hollow.
I don’t feel satisfied with this ‘win’. Just another confirmation that I’m of use in society.

Opportunities seem like another chain  to a debt in the making. I haven’t found anyone to love because I had ‘better things to do.’ I gave up the dating field and social circles to get that grade and move up. I finally got all the ‘requirements’ to start my life, so that the voices can leave my life alone.
1) get a a stable job
2) get the degree
3) unlock your freedom and do what you want (what if this was a lie too?)

Will they ever let me be me? Did they lie again?

I don’t remember what my dreams or aspirations were. I feel so hollow and robotic like an NPC. Even finishing up this last obstacle, people suggest to me to get my masters. I question what my next step should be, is it just fulfil someone else’s dream? Getting the work experience is supposed to help me find my ‘calling’ in life, I have doubts already.

What did I truly want? I don’t know who I am anymore so how do I know I’m doing the right thing? What is my calling in life? I just want to sleep and never wake up. 

I am afraid of the future."

LifeBytes123,2022-03-08 16:11:53+00:00,Another post venting my feelings.,"I have therapy tomorrow once again and it's been almost a year since I have started for my (severe) sex dysphoria and i feel like i should just quit. Nothing is help and i don't like their suggestions, which include:

- transitioning 
- exploring my male body (fucking gross)
- TMS (will do no good if you cannot solve the route of the problem)
- attend LGT meetings 
- get surgery to have feminine features on my face (not something heterosexual men do)
- wear womens clothing

This doesn't actually help MY issue. It may be solutions to typical gender dysphoria, but MY dysphoria. My issue is I'm a heterosexual cis-male wanting to be a cis-female and any middle ground route is not going to help me. 

Since I'm the wrong cis-gender, i don't want to be seen in public or leave the house or work on my body. What's the point? Male body is ugly regardless of the body type. 

I think my best course of action is to just let the depression fester until I reach my threshold and take my own life. Why not? We all die anyways. Why postpone the inevitable if i don't want to be here. Also going to quit therapy because it is a waste of time."

But next thing I knew I was in a hospital and I felt like shit. Never actually died tho, just passed out, cuz ya know, drowning and everything. Anyway, I know nobody cares but it at least let's me know the next time I want to, it will actually be successful."

lliw_kirev2,2022-03-08 06:28:42+00:00,losing hope..,my life has been going downwards since my grandmothers death in 2018 it really hit home because my family and i knew she was going to pass due to stage 4 cancer but me and my family didn’t expect all these events to happen so fast. Her diagnosis came out of nowhere after a random check up. she pasted while i was still in highschool my grades started to flunk but i managed to pick them up for my final two years. after that i joined the airforce in 2021 returned home medically discharged for anxiety i had in basic i also have no car no house of my own i turn 19 this year and just been lost on what to do next my mom i live with now wants me to move out next year. currently i am saving for a vehicle on my own and i currently work at a dead end job with shitty people in costumer service. i deal with anxiety and i feel very depressed just lost in life like i don’t feel like a teen should i’m not antisocial most my friends are on IG and i don’t have any irl. i never been to a party as an adult nor had a girlfriend i feel different then my baby face appearance only makes people think i’m younger than what i am which fuels rejection from girls and disrespect from costumers and others. i hate it and i feel powerless even the stuff i’m doing doesn’t feel satisfying i constantly feel anxious whenever the discussion of my future i brought up. i know this was a lot but i would like some advice and lastly no i am not suicidal.

I have no friends, I mean the few that I have around me, I don't feel a genuine connection. I have no girlfriend but I really want one. People say im good lucking but my confidence is super low. Growing up in LA I was bullied alot and constantly made fun of. Every year I got older I said ""next year will be better"" and it just hasn't gotten better. I'm so lonely. I spend my days just going to work and going home and laying in bed in my apartment. I have nobody. I'm so bored. I have been having suicidal thoughts and I feel miserable. I'm afraid I might one day act on the suicidal feelings. Everybody at work loves me but why don't I have any true close friends??? How do I fix myself?? I'm insecure about everything including my weight and look. I'm 22 but look kind of childish. I'm not progressing in school as fast as I want to either. My life is a mess. I'm really depressed right now, this is the worst it's ever been. I just really want some friends to hangout and do stuff with. I want a life outside of work. I also want a sense of purpose and hobbies. If you guys have any advice for me I would appreciate it. 

Thank you friends"
sheepgalaxy2000,2022-03-08 04:14:00+00:00,Childhood traumas sucks. It affects me up until now.,"I hate my mom so much. Whenever I hear or read the question ""what's your favorite childhood memory?"" nothing good pops up in my mind. 
I remember the days when she hit me aggressively with anything until it breaks just because of a mistake that every child will do. When I grew up as an adult, I realized that what she have done was too harsh for a kid!
She even commented on my weight that I am fat over and over that's why I became bulimic and I hate it because until now I am still bulimic.
I am doing my best to forgive her but I still remember what happened in the past crystal clear. 
Whenever she speaks, I don't want to hear anything from I just pretend that I care.
She even blame me for being diagnosed with PTB! As if I want to be sick. 
She doesn't want me to be independent and rely on her and it's really choking me. I just want to be happy. I'm tired.
Now I'm flunking at school. Currently I'm taking my bachelor's degree and the preliminary exams week is approaching, but I don't want to do anything. I pretend that I'm attending classes but I don't. I just wanna lay on the bed all day and do nothing. I hate this."

I hope I don’t have depression for life.

But lately none of those things are doing it for me anymore. Ill exercise until I cant move anymore and nothing happens. Im blank, a void of a human being. The apathy has gotten so bad that I have lost my inner monologue. I have no good moments anymore. Its constant emptiness. Alcohol, weed, pills, nothing does it anymore. I’m reluctant to try meds because i’ve had bad experiences with antidepressants before and I know all I need is one bad experience and ill finally have the courage to end it. My life in essence is pure misery. I have been putting up with this apathetic hellhole for a solid 2 months now. The longest streak of it so far. The looming thought of suicide is becoming more and more prevalent by the day."

It touched my heart about the fact that my teacher took the time to take me out of class and make sure I was ok, yet the first thing out of me was “I’m just tired, I’m fine”. This man is genuinely a role model for me and he’s the sweetest individual u can ever meet, and as much as I know I wanted to tell him what was really wrong, I just couldn’t do it and I don’t know why. I’ve been saying “I’m just tired” for so long that actually explaining what “I’m tired” really means to someone seems impossible.

Anyways, one of my “friends”, Nick (fake name) came up to me, called me anorexic (I get that a lot even though I have B.E.D.), then said, “how do you feel knowing that you will never gain weight or muscle mass no matter how hard you try?” I am totally trigged at this point and yell “SHUT THE FUCK UP” at the top of my lungs with my absolute favorite teacher standing nearby.

I just want to share what's been going on with me for the past one year. Anyway I hope I don't get hate either. I apologize if the story doesn't make sense, Im not that good in explaining stuff but I'll try to tell it as accurate as possible.

Let's begin my story

One year ago I got into my first serious relationship. Well me and that girl we lasted 2 months, almost 3. She was the only person to accept me for who I was. I really loved her. She was my motivation, she was the thing that helped me during rough days. I went kinda sceptical into this relationship due to previous attempts to have someone who loves me. Anyways this is my last year in high school and I'm out of the small town I live in. I hate it here. I feel like nobody not even my parents love me I just feel like I don't belong here. For example one year ago I had people to hang out with for instance to drink beer and vibe to music and all that stuff. Now I don't have anyone, I feel pretty lonely, I don't go out as much due to the fact that I don't have somebody to go out with. Instead I stay home and watch TV Shows, listen to music and play videogames because that's the only hope I've got left. I really want someone to love me, to support me. I need that motivation to go on with life. Now I just want to die because nobody not even a single soul would give a fuck if I just disappear. I really want to go to a therapist but I don't know how to tell my parents (we don't speak that much) and that therapist is fucking expensive. After I broke up with that girl I started smoking weed, it helped in the beginning, it made me happy, sociable when I was high I forgot about the pain and the things that were happening to me. Now I want to buy some xanax just to get high and forget about pain again.


Anyways, I hope I didn't bother you with this boring story. If you want to know anything else about it I will reply with a comment. Thanks for reading this post once again, I hope everyone here is well and alive. Also I apologize for my bad English."

All my relationships fail. The military left me with fucked up legs and some ptsd and I can’t get help with it frankly I don’t think the same as other people in general and on top of it I legit act way older than I am which is great until you want to build relationships your own age I also am aggressive usually I hide it I know I have to have mental issues but I can’t get any help nor begin to know how really I’m very suicidal but I know doing so would be useless I feel alone not only because I really am but also alone in how I am how I think I hate to post this but I have nobody to talk to I just have really nothing going well in my life and I feel like an absolute failure.

Relationships never lasts with me, in fact I never really had any serious ones I've had maybe 3 relationships but back in high school which lasted 1-3 months.

And if it didn’t then i must sound crazy but hear me out first
I’m trying my best to live a life without regrets and unfortunately it’s not really working 
I have a lot of them and it’s safe to assume that it had a huge effect on me

It really started years ago I was without a doubt a trouble maker but even so I had my morals keeping me strong Until I was placed over in a foster care home
I couldn’t believe what was happening and why it did happen to me of all people I only later found out that my home wasn’t a good place to grow up in we not only had lots of fights but also financial issues. Even so I never really stood still by it until I was alone in my room locked up until the day was over to be only send to my room. 
It was so shocking for me that my behavior changed. It wasn’t much at first and I noticed little of it. I closed up I started to meet less people be less active and keep a lot of things for myself not only that but I just simply smiled through the pain

Through the years I have forgotten what I used to look like when I was smiling for real 
It is such a problem right now because I don’t know which one is the real one I have forgotten who I was but I remember being a better person someone who was a party maker and liked being with friends and family but now I’m totally the opposite 
I AM STUCK
I know what I’m doing is bad but I am comfy now with it

I currently work in a call center and I only make $16 an hour. If I didn't have a family to live with, I'f probably be homeless.

My parents decided it was a good idea for me not to attend high school due to worries they had of my epilepsy. Idk maybe they felt like they couldn't keep an eye on me in case something went wrong? Them doing that has cost me the opportunity to get GCSEs and not be in a position to go to university.

Whatever right? I managed to secure free education at this College which took me in and gave me work experience, at the time I thought it was something good but in reality looking back that college was a money making opportunity and I did more work than studying.

They made me work to the bone, long hours to the point I'll come home drained from work and having to deal with family at home. My dumbass thought these people were looking out for me, the company got closed by the government and they left with no trace to be seen.

I was mentally burnt out working there for 4 years and only realised their intentions once the government shur down as I had this image they were good..they helped me, fed me and have me money.

I was young and stupid. That burnt me out, I wasn't mentally okay and took a holiday to do traveling for 2yrs...

Came backe to start looking for new job with my experience in office administration, sad part is as my old company didn't exist.. no reference, no pay slips, no nothing. 

I started doing clean jobs, even though my family didn't approve.. picked myself up, made friends and even found a girl. Life was okay! It wasn't great but it was okay.. 

Providing for my family, seeing friends and progressing in my career as I went from cleaning offices to working in the office and just grew from there.. 

My career was good working at one of the biggest medical university in the UK dispute not having no education, friends I had some for the very first time!

But oh man did shit go down hill, the girl who I loved and was in process of marrying told me she was seeing someone else and is marrying him in a few weeks.

Friends who I supported at their lowest points I'm their life either financially or just being there for them.. left me/ghosted me and only want something from me.. 

These are people..friends, I was the reason why they worked at some of the biggest companies...got married....grew on Twitch.. prevented suicide..even their housing.. I could list 100s of shit I did for these people and when I am at my lowest NO ONE reached out to me.

Evan as I write this, no one has noticed my absence.. 

Career, dispute being at a high level in my career (mid management) I faced racism to the point where I just quit and started doing temp jobs.. but even with the tmep jobs I'm faced with bullshit from my own family.

I've been the breadwinner or whatever the term is called since I was 17, I got into debt because of these people and still required to pay for everything even though I am unable.. no one works, I tried moving out and I'm getting called out for being a shit son.

What do I do? 

All I want is to live peacefully, stable job, real friends, wife who doesn't want much, and to watch anime and play my video games.

I don't think I'm asking for much.. but recently I am having so many suicidal thoughts.. I know life is a test but boy I have been tested since I was 17 and getting tired of it."

SpareSomeWeed,2022-03-06 16:58:41+00:00,Realizing how lonely I am now that covid restrictions have lifted,I was in my last year of High school when covid happened and I had already distanced myself from everyone at school bc I was struggling with anxiety and shit. And then covid happened and I had a good excuse to be on my own. To not interact with my peers. To not hang out with anyone. But I also isolated myself from all the people around me and now that everything is opening up again and the restrictions have been fully lifted in my country I’m noticing that I’m super alone. My sibling is hanging out almost every day of the week with different friend groups doing several fun things. And I’m just at home. Doing nothing. Only time I do anything is when my parents want to do something (which is barely ever) and now I’m just scared to even make new friends because I feel like I’ve been mentally and emotionally stunted and my brain is still 16 years old

CanadianGangsta,2022-03-06 15:50:10+00:00,It's been a while since I actually feel happy,"I'm not supposed to be like this. I have an honest job and I work from home, I get to spend time with my 2yo and my wife, our parents are healty and we all get along, financially stable, some leftovers after paying bills. Everything is in order, but I am not happy.

In fact, I'm pretty fucking far from happy.

I lose my shit when my son makes a mess, I know he is just 2yo and I shouldn't, but I do, I regret afterwards but I still do. Like when he throws food around, in 5 seconds I would get furious, I need to try very hard to stop myself from screaming at him, and when I cool down, I feel like a grade A loser for getting mad at a baby, but I can't seem to control it. Feels like I have this rage right under my skin, waiting for every chance to explode.

Evey time my wife tells me to do sth or make a comment about me, I feel like she's attacking me, judging me, never once told me I've made her proud or happy. Just endless complaining, and the worst part is, 10 things she bugs me for doing, she does at least 9, and she bugs me while she's doing it. For example, she would be pissed when I use my phone while playing with my son, and she's 5 feet away blasting her Tiktok.

At work, I do what I'm told. No room for innovation, new ideas, or thinking in general. A well progammed bot can easily replace me. 

I feel like I'm trapped, I have so many things I want to do, but I can't leave what I have behind. 

Talked to my wife about it, all she had to say was:"" Suck it up, work hard, get promoted, and you will have the time and money to do that."". It did not help.

Sometimes it hurts so much, I can feel the cold sharp pain in my chest, I will just hide in the shower and cry.

Only warmth I can feel is when I hold my son, my purpose, my goal, my baby.

Days in, days out, feel like I'm like a gear, locked inside a machine, turning and turning in the same place, just oblivion.

Wow, feel more like a piece of shit after writing this. I'm sorry if this isn't making much sense, but thank you for reading, appreciate it."

Ryesalmon6472,2022-03-06 08:12:06+00:00,If You're Still Here...How Did You Manage It? How Did You Accept ANY Kind Of Happiness?,"Depressive Major Disorder. Major body image issues. ADD. Social Anxiety. Always been single. Bullied at school and online. What more is there to say? That's been my life since 7 yrs old.

Basically I've been thinking about what happiness looks like for me...and I guess it just doesn't seem worth it? ""All the suffering for THAT?"". I don't even really understand the concept of being ""Happy"" so maybe I just don't get it. Like what even IS happy? I don't even remember what that feels like. That's a thing people actually experience?...And have?...For large parts of their lives?

Basically my question is for those who've maybe found happiness or maybe you even just made it through the day: What kept you going? What was enough for you to think: ""You know what? One more day""? What got you out of bed and brushing your teeth at a regular time, if at all? Was it one thing in particular? A sign? A stray thought? A person? What does happiness mean for you?




I don't think I could ever truly find this elusive and unrealistic thing called Happiness. And even if I did, I don't think mine is worth going through even just another day for. That's not just a Depressive though too, I genuinely think that...although I guess that's the point of it being called a Mental Illness lol"

I just wanted to share my week, maybe it’ll help someone but if not I just need to vent. Basically 8 months ago I got a nose job in turkey (I live in America), I did this bc of the cost portion, a couple months after the procedure I started to loathe my nose, a huge bump appeared and I was told it was cartilage and I needed another nose job. so I saved up, for 4 months to get another one. Two weeks ago, I flew back to surgery to get another nose job. Spent almost all my money (I know it’s irresponsible I’m 20 give me a break) and less then a week later after I fly back the bumps back. Not to mention, my stitches came out and I can’t fly back to turkey to fix them so I’ve been going doctor to doctor and everyone refuses to do it b/c I got it done in another country. I felt defeated, so I decided I will drive to my dads for the weekend to see him. On my way, a tire runs off the road no idea how and hits my car. It’s $1000 to fix, then to top it off I found out tonight my boyfriend is cheating on me. Lastly, I have a drug test coming up that I’m paranoid I won’t pass.

A mole on my face recently started bleeding and I literally can not afford to have cancer. But really worst of all, the love of my life left me. She wants to pursue her independence and find herself with herself after 3 and a half years. We already live together, she became a part of me, I’m losing a part of myself I feel. I love her so much I can’t really even be mad at her, I feel the responsible side of me remind me supporting her is the right thing. She’s young, I’m young. I can’t hold her back from what she wants to pursue. So here we go again. Something else I have to face now. But now it feels like im homeless. I have no space to look forward to at the end of the day. Im just filled with pain. It almost seems really easy for her to go through this and that makes it even more painful. She says it isn’t easy for her. It sure isn’t easy for me. I want to wake up and just go back to how things were. I miss her so much."
Deritaf,2022-03-05 05:12:44+00:00,Vent sesh,"Maybe they know a little, but no one knows how depressed I really am. I’m exhausted. I’ve always been depressed on and off meds for years, but getting out of a traumatic abusive relationship….I’m barely surviving 6 months after. I’m reliving the same day over and over again, and on top of that- got a second job so now I’m burnt out and overworked.

Needed to vent here. I’m getting on meds soon, but as usual that first step when you’re depressed is the hardest. It’s ironic how depression is literally you vs yourself….no one else.

Ppl may know I’m stressed, and mourning my relationship but I don’t think they know to the extent. Sometimes it would be nice to know that someone cares. But I do know  even someone telling me they care wouldn’t just magically make me not depressed. Just because I’m strong doesn’t mean I’m okay. Therapy helps but I always end up right back into the awful negative thinking pattern.

Everyone’s got their own shit and it’s not all about me. I try to remind myself that.

I’m talking in circles but it needed to get out before I keep having multiple panic attacks.

Side note: anyone bummed they can’t quite literally mask their depression as the mandate is coming to an end? I have a lot of anxiety around it like ppl will know I’m miserable

And all this situation is horrible. But is there excuse for making fun of death? I am stopping believing in humanity like that.

People say go out there, protest, go in jail, fight and die for your freedom. And I think I am close to the point. But at least I want to make use of my death. I want to use it as a protest. Make it public.

For example I left work early today because I get off super late at night when everything is closed and I barely get to enjoy my life nowadays, I left because he promised we would go get food together and some other stuff. 

He had a messed up tire for the past two weeks but hasn’t fixed it because of financial reasons.

He kept filling it with air and apparently today the tire just popped right when I got off work exactly at 6:30 when I told him I was gonna leave that’s when he texts me and says we can’t do anything anymore because of the tire.

Whatever if you loved and cared about me as a gf you would just call us an Uber there and back. 

So tired of his excuses and him making me feel completely worthless numb empty and depressed af because he’s always like this all he does is disappoint and unfortunately i just deal with it because my parents both failed me and disappointed me multiple times as a child so now I just deal with it like it’s normal.


I literally cannot take this mental torture any longer. 

I’m completely independent and I even have my own place but for some reason I’m too mentally weak to leave his ass I done it before but I went back unfortunately like the true dumb ass that I am…

I have to keep living for my family as i know it would destroy their lives and my mum would probably end her life but damn I wish I could just die, I'm expected to get a job and do things but I don't even want to be alive so why would I want to do anything 

I keep telling myself life will get better but it hasn't and I don't think it ever will, I don't understand why all of this has happened to me and what I've done to deserve it. I feel so sad"
Salt-Emu3863,2022-03-04 07:22:08+00:00,one good thing about being depressed,"i isolate myself a lot, never was extremly social i think. basically act as much as a modern hermit as i   
personally can nowdays. gives a lot of time to think about philosophy, ethics and spirituality among other things

still trying to be true and fair, seeing things in as much different point of views as i can, understanding all i can, etc...

helps realise a lot of things about yourself, others, life. how different things relate to each others, etc...

depression helps ""keep things real"" on certain points, depression is a sneaky devil that will take advantage of you on many points but emphasis on sneaky, very talented at that so it's not as ""easy"" as a crude monster that will straight up lie to you all the time.

like a good manipulator it uses truth, will twist it when needed but there is truth in it.

i try to recognise the truth and ""set things straight"", helps understand a looooooot of things better, even if the truth is ugly sometimes.

in the grand schemes of things it's often ""just a matter of perspective"", a good and bad one both being ""true"" isn't uncommon. it's a very complex subject but i don't want to get lost into that right now

i'm glad that i'm able to do what i do, even if it doesn't ""make me happy"". i just wish that i could get out of what to me is a cancer called life, this ""normal"" human life really ain't for me. that's all i could get out without becoming radically incoherent right now, cheers"

After I was diagnosed with ADHD only about a month ago, I started taking Concerta and immediately a lot of my depression symptoms subsided and I've felt great for the first time in a while. But just yesterday I got a worrying call from my doctor that since my heart rate was lower than they expected there's now a concern about whether it's safe for me to be taking a stimulant, so starting today up until my next appointment and potentially beyond it I was instructed to stop taking Concerta.
I've already just today felt a lot more depressed than I have in a while and I'm dreading the next couple weeks because of it.

It's a really stupid and not very easy for the customer to navigate. I mentioned that and said that we might have to continue our current process plus what HQ wants us to do. She immediately shut me down stating we are not going to be doing ""extra"" work and if the customers complain, HQ can deal with it. I get what she's saying but at the same time the ""extra"" work isn't really extra. Left me feeling depressed for the rest of the day. Our boss, whom I worked with before, seems very friendly with everyone else. Chatting and talking to them, clearly liking the other staff. I know I'm different and I have very strong view points but I'm just so tired of being jealous (I guess) that everyone else seems to be heard and not me.

differences in age. I was 18 &amp; he was 26. We were in
two different stages in our lives. He wanted marriage
and kids and I wanted to graduate college.
Long story short we broke up. I didn't start deeply
missing him until now (4 years later). He's married to
another girl he's not happy with. Part of me thinks he's
my twin flame because he always called me when I was
thinking about him or having a bad day.
I drunk call him on New Years, I blacked out most of the
night. I remember waking up the next morning with two
missed calls from him.
I never called back because I was so embarrassed.
Fast forward to now, I texted him apologizing for drunk
calling him. But the messages won't go through. He
blocked me. My heart is hurting so bad. I miss him.
believe he was truly my soulmate.
I still have his voicemails, I listen to them when I miss
him. &amp; now that he blocked me part of me feels like it
went with him.
Has any once else been through this. Why does it feel
like we broke up all over again.

How did you guys get over it? Did this happen to anyone and you ended up getting back together?"

I'm not a lazy person. I've always been a nerd in school and college. I always had very high grades on everything. During that time I was also doing extreme, unhealthy amounts of workout. It was like I had infinite focus and energy and was unable to get tired.

Now I don't have the motivation and energy and interest to do anything at all. I don't brush my teeth I don't shower, I don't eat unless I feel really hungry, I don't leave the house, I don't try to do anything to get out of this situation. I have no energy for therapy. Talking exhausts me alot, traveling also exhausts me alot. I barely even have energy to be on reddit and play videogames, but I need something to do. My restless mind doesn't allow me to lay on my bed the whole day.

I had so much energy before my depression and now depression sucked all the energy out of me. I don't see a point in anything anymore. Why would I study? Why would I talk to a therapist if that doesnt cure me anyway? Why would I get a job? Why would I go outside to talk with people? I'm not fucking interested in anything.

How do I get my energy back so that I can fight my depression and progress further in life? I can't even go to therapy or live a healthy lifestyle."

ShineLokabrenna,2022-03-03 04:31:51+00:00,Releaving Mental Illness,"Hi, my name is Sarah and I suffer from anxiety and depression. Doing basic things can be really tricky sometimes, (particularly if all I'm in the mood for is driving my car into a brick wall) but over the years I've learnt some coping methods. Some of them of pretty basic, but I hope that maybe one of these tricks can help you. 

1) tell someone. Don't be an idiot, we all know that left alone intrusive thoughts rave. Talk to a trusted friend or family member, or if these options aren't available to you, post here. Sometimes we need our space but you shouldn't bottle it up every time

2) go for a walk. Woah okay I know its basic as hell but how many of us actually do this? I know I don't at least. When I get sad I curl up into blankets and shut the world out. Sometimes that's what exactly what I need, but if it doesn't go away I need to do something else. After a walk (when I do go) I'm usually tired but not as anxious as I was before.

3) write down the problem and dissect it, what are you afraid of and how rational is this possibility? Sometimes you don't have to write it down, you can just think about it in your head. My anxiety triggers randomly and sometimes I need to check in with myself to see what's actually the problem. I wanted to text a friend ealier about changes to some plans, and I was feeling anxious at the time. I text people often, so it hadnt occurred to me that was what was causing the anxiety until I had sent the message. Sometimes im perfectly aware and I know my fear is unrational so I need to sit down and sort it out.

4) eat your favourite food or something you really enjoy. Today I got soaked, my dress turned see- through and my umbrella was practically useless. I sat at university miserable, feeling stressed over the decision to go home or stay for class. In that moment, I chose me. I knew I wasn't happy so I stepped away from the situation and decided to head back home. On the way back, I got maccas chips (mc donalds) and instant dopamine had me back on track. I wanted to spend all day in bed because one thing had gone wrong and I felt that was it, nothing else could happen. But food brought me back lol. Dont use junk food to cure depression everytime, but occasionally its a good idea!"
forgotten_king1,2022-03-03 04:24:41+00:00,I need some advice please.,"Just a quick warning, this is going to be long, so bear with me. I'm essentially going to rant about my life and why I've lost my will to live. If it is too long for you, its ok if you don't read it. I'm not looking expecting many replies anyway.

So here it goes:

My life really has never been that bad, I grew up in a household where, to an outsider, we were the perfect family. Loving. Caring. But if you lived with me. You knew that wasn't true. I believe I started to develop depression, anxiety, and some small form of bipolar disorder (never got checked for that so its just my best guess.) From 4th grade to 8th. Didn't really have many friends during my life. I met my best friend in 4th grade because we both got picked on and he was the new kid in school. But now he's gone. I met a few other decent friends but none that I can pour my heart out to. By 8th grade I tried to kill myself. Tried to od on pills. Everyone was mad at me. Said they didn't understand how I could do such a thing I have a great life. But my thoughts every single day were of hatred, death, and I honestly started imagining ways to die in my spare time. I put on a front, pretended I was happy but when I got home all I could do was cry. My mom, she thought I was being dramatic. That I need to be thankful for the life I had. And maybe it was true, maybe I was dramatic, but those comments only made me spiral deeper and deeper. Then one day, I found the love I thought I was missing. I met a girl, we started dating. Shit, I even lost my virginity to her. Things were great. A year had passed with this girl and I was naive of course thinking this was who I would marry someday. Then, out of nowhere, things changed. One day, she just wasn't attracted to me, and I didn't understand it at the time, but when we broke up, I found out she had been cheating. My soul was absolutely crushed. In that moment, for the next year, I felt more alone than ever. Didnt speak to anyone, just sat depressed alone with my thoughts. And if its the previous part in this post is any evidence, I dont do well wallowing in my own thoughts. I nearly jumped off a bridge 3 separate times. Its not that I didn't want to die. I was too scared. Which in turn made me even more depressed. Eventually, I moved on, as most people do, but it still lingers to this day, what could have been and what it was. I started to finally work on myself, because maybe people didn't love me because of the person I was. So for the next 2 years I focused on my own health, happiness, and everything in between. I was doing so good too. Then, out of nowhere, my dad left. My dad was the only one in my family I felt I could talk to. I looked up to him. Wanted to be him, as a father, brother, son. So when he cheated on my mom, and then left me and my brother to move in with a woman he knew for 2 months, essentially cutting his past life out the picture. By this time my brother was married, and moved out. So I sat there, every single damn night. Watching my mom cry, threaten to kill herself, and berate me out of anger. I would go to work where everyone hates me, then come home to my mom breaking things in the house and telling me I'm gonna be just like my dad. But, I didn't even have time to grieve, cry. I had to be strong for my mom and I did. She finally started to feel OK. But I wasn't. All of a sudden, all the work I did to br better, flew out the window in an instant. All those dark thoughts took over my mind again and I havent been able to get them out since. Now, as I'm typing this, I'll probably be homeless soon. With not being able to pay for an apartment, ny mom is moving in with a new guy, and I can't go. I have nowhere to go. And all the things I did for my mom, went unnoticed. I'm a walking punching bag and I'm feeling like I should be decommissioned. This has been hands down, the lowest point in my life. I can feel myself about to break. How do I handle these feelings?? Someone please help."

But now, I’m left wondering what my next step should be. I’ll be lucky if I have $200 to my name after this next rent check clears. I’m seeing someone, but it’s way too early on to even *think* about the topic of living together. I don’t trust anybody else to take my roommate’s place without them turning out to be a flaky or unreliable person.

I’m turning 27 in a few months and I’ve never lived completely on my own before. I’ve always had roommates; never just me and my cat. I want to do it, but I know I’ll have to get a second job to afford it, which would be tough.

Just the fact that things are changing again makes me sad. I’m not ready for this. I have a few months before the lease ends, but it never feels long enough to really get ready. I’ve moved almost every year since I was 20, and the constant rotating of doors really does wear a person’s spirit down after a while.

I think I will try to work out and take a nice hot bath to bring my spirits up tonight. I spent most of the evening in bed, feeling like shit, but I know that won’t do me any favors. I want to try to exercise tonight and then start working on some sort of plan tomorrow about what I’ll do. Wish me luck, this will be a big step into the unknown for me."

I tried so hard to impress them during trial I did my very best without much help or guidance. I even tried talking to the other staff members WITH crippling social anxiety issues I thought my life was changing for the better but I guess I'm back where I started :( 

I don't want to tell my mum because she was hoping I'd get this job and start a fresh new chapter. I've only let her down if anything by not getting it in the end. 

I really needed this job though, as I'm unemployed it would have been so perfect if I got it! 

I don't understand what to do anymore I've been looking for steady work for ages now. 

Sorry if it sounds like I'm complaining I'm just.. genuinely devestated. 

Maybe there's something wrong with me. Why don't hiring managers want to hire me?"

But anyway, due to some unforeseen circumstances i now have lost everything. I stopped talking to everyone, not going out as much, my birthday was back in january did absolutely nothing. Every time i talk to my family it’s always “when are you gonna get a job?” like i’m not trying already. And I don’t have money to hang out with my friends at the moment.

Sharpshooter09475,2022-03-02 02:42:25+00:00,I was wondering,"

TL;DR at bottom ;)

I have been diagnosed with severe depression, and i was just trying to figure out why, when i thought i had found what it stemmed from. i was thinking if i should tell someone because for now all i have told my doctor and therapist is people at school was why i was feeling this way. My dad has physically and verbally abused me for my entire life, and i am still a minor, (13) so i am currently still living with him. I have nightmares and flashback-type things during the day about many of these memories, but i figured that was normal for people with depression. I am an idiot for not realizing that my dad had something to do with it. I’ll start from the beginning with the memories i have the most details to, then work my way down. 

One of my first memories was when i came home from kindergarten. My dad was outside and he asked me how my day was and I said “good” or something of that nature. He had previously been upset with me about “not telling him enough about my day”. He was very upset with me again, but this time it was more. He went inside and started yelling at my mom (in the kitchen) about me and she said he was overreacting. He went outside and grabbed me and pinned me against the fridge by my neck, choking me for a while, then dropped me, twice. I was bawling and my mom kept trying to get him to stop all the while, keep in mind i was 5 or so.

This one was from 3-4 years ago. We live in a colder state and my dad had put a small stack of firewood outside for us to move inside. My mom and sister decided i was the one who needed to move the firewood. I had other chores i was doing and completely forgot to move the firewood, even though there was plenty of wood inside. My dad came home and saw that the firewood was not moved, and went inside. He was again very angry and i told him it was my job, and I apologized for forgetting to move the wood. By this point i was shaking visibly because i knew what happened when i forgot things. He walked past me and i heard banging soon, and then he went to bed. I went downstairs where i heard the banging and my dad had smashed the computer i had built with a hammer then drove two screwdrivers through it. 

1 month ago, we were coming back from our grandparents and my dad was upset about something and we stopped by my uncles house. He went inside and told us not to come with him. We waited 20+ minutes in the car before i got out to go inside and see what was taking so long. This was the wrong move. As soon as i stepped inside, my father’s eyes told me i was pretty much fucked. I turned around and ran, accidentally slamming the door behind me. I went back out and got in the car and locked the door, and my dad open my moms door and unlocked it, grabbed me by the neck and threw me ~6 feet across the driveway, then he told me to apologize right now or he would “hurt me very badly.”

1 year ago, we went to the lake near us and it was very low, so there was lots of sand so my sister and i went to explore. We went around the mud the first time, but our parent called and we went a straight line (we thought it would be faster) through the mud. We got up the hill and my dad slapped my across the face and told me i was a worthless piece of shit.

~2 years ago, when we went on an offroad trip (with jeeps, etc) and i fell over in the mud when we went to look at a view. He was very upset and  he hit me and made me do all of the laundry for a month.

This one was also from around 3-4 years ago. It was summertime and my dad had went into a sort of drinking frenzy, and i was beat every few days because of random things like not mowing the lawn well enough.


I had not put my shoes away correctly (it was winter and there was snow on them) and he told me that he would kill all of my pet fish by burning them in our fireplace. This was recent, maybe 3 months ago.

There were many more occasions, but these are the ones I remember most clearly. I feel like maybe i should ask my doctor if there is a possibility i have ptsd? I think about these all the time and whenever i am around my dad, and even sometimes when i’m not, i feel really on edge like he is going to hurt me again, and like I mentioned i have nightmares.  I also think about these times during the day and get scared.

Sometimes i just cry in the middle of the night, frozen in fear of dad.

I’m sorry if this isn’t allowed, but i feel like there is a possibility i have ptsd from him.

I love him, but it’s hard when it feels like every little thing i do sets him off, and i really don’t want him to go to jail or be taken away.

TL;DR
My dad abuses me, i state some of the times above, i have nightmares and “flashback” type things about these times, is there a possibility i have ptsd/should i tell my doctor/therapist about these times? I want him to stay and not go to jail or be taken away but if i tell them it feels envitable

Thank you all."

Wolfman_1998,2022-03-02 00:33:32+00:00,Does anyone else feel the same way about this,"I was wondering if anyone else feels the same way about this. I get very depressed that I'm not in a relationship and that I haven't been with anyone in my life. So I try to keep myself occupied by watching my favorite shows and reading books. But sometimes when I watch a show there's always a scene where characters are being happy in a relationship and they end up being intimate with each other. I just read a chapter in my book where the main character has sex with a chick he barely knows. It's like I'm being reminded how lonely and pathetic I feel. I know these characters are fictional and it's part of the story, but it doesn't mean that it hurts any less. I'm sure when these things are written by people, they don't think about it cause they themselves are either in a relationship or have had sex before. This is probably stupid but I just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same or not when they watch a show or read a book."

23/F. I live at home because my mom died so I’m helping raise my siblings and take care of my dad. I don’t drive or have a license because apparently I’m too stupid. And no one ever teaches me. Not like I have the money for a car anyways. I work 40-50 hours a week and most of my money goes to helping with bills, buying my groceries, and getting stuff for my siblings. I have zero in savings and nothing to show for years of working my butt off. 

Here’s where it gets nasty. I am not a dirty person and refuse to live in filth. I’m the only one that cleans in this 5 person household. I do the best I can. Well we have lice and bedbugs. Honestly don’t know where it came from, I’m pretty sure from my little sisters friends because they’ve had them before. I am SO embarrassed. I don’t have the money to do what’s necessary to get rid of them. I treat my hair and try to make my sister treat hers but she fights me about it. She’s 15 and ever since mom died she doesn’t listen to anyone and does whatever she wants. 


So I hate my life. I go no where but home and work. I have no one to talk to because I’m embarrassed and disgusted. I wish I could walk away and never come back but I feel stuck . Like I didn’t sign up for this. That sounds terrible but. Please no rude comments

I cry all the time. I’m miserable. I want to self harm. I want to run away. I just want to have a normal life"

I go to private school and I hate it. I don't belong and I literally have no friends. Even if I think I got a good grade , everyone else gets better grades. I always get below average and everyone thinks I'm a failure. Today was my last chance to get above average and stay in my school. But , I didn't get above average. Infact. All of them were below average , again. Like always. My mom is probably going to make me quit school and nobody can fix anything because I've already gotten it. I try and try but I always stay the same failure. I have no right to be living and absorbing everything. I might just kill myself. I want to kill my self. I wanted to go to cram school but my parents won't let me. I'm a failure. I'm stupid and deserve nothing. I know that you can't just wish that you'd be smarter and get smarter but just once , only one time , I wish I could be smarter. I wish I could be better at my talents and not have a thousand of them that aren't even prodigy level. I wish I wasn't me. i hate the person I am now. Even people with ADHD do better than me. I'm nothing. A a piece of nothing. And I hate that I know that because I wish I didn't. And now I need to quit school. I deserve this. 

Why isn't everything easy like it was in elementary school?

Why don't I get better grades?

People might say that grades don't matter. But think about NOW. Now , we need grades to go to college and it has to be good. NOW , we need to ace tests to go to better colleges , NOW getting good grades without trying is a genius , a prodigy. NOW , I'm not a genius. I'm not good at anything. Slow and stupid ,really stupid. 

I have none of that. And I don't blame anyone or anything. I blame myself. I caught off track and I never listen and I've used all my chances. I made myself a failure. A failure with no talents. A failure with nothing. And I used to look down at people that got lower grades than me. Look at me now. I'm the bottom of the society.

words come out of my mouth that i don’t mean, i make snappy comments, i have short responses to their questions. with my ex when i ended things i was such a hugeee bitch because i was so *hurt* with life, but why am i treating those i love badly? i’m acting like a hormonal teenager but i’m 23, i’m being so immature. i know i sound insufferable and honestly i really am at this point but it fucking sucks. this is part of why i deserve to die. i don’t want to make anyone sad, i hate that i’m acting this way, i claim to have a lot of empathy and yet i’m doing this?? wtf is wrong with me. 

i didn’t used to be this way. i used to be bubbly and always nice, even with shitty mental health i took others feelings into consideration. but now it’s just too hard to pretend to be happy that i’m not even pretending anymore, i let my depression affect others and i NEED to stop. i hate life *so* much, i can barely hold convos, i just want to isolate forever but that doesn’t need to be acting this way towards others. i feel so fucking guilty and so bad for them. i’m trying to move out soon, so they don’t have to deal with me. i’m so excited to die so that they’ll never have to again"

jlukeg,2022-02-28 15:20:54+00:00,There's no magic bullet,"There's no magic bullet, but maybe the bullet that could go through my head is the magic one I've been looking for all these years.

At this point I have tried so many things to overcome the weight of this depression. 

I've read books, taken medicine, gone on retreats, tried microdosing, therapy, and more. Nothing has helped.

My whole life has been a fight and waking up feels so heavy. I have no joy, nothing excites me, and yet I keep going. I keep going because I'm too much of a coward to end it, I keep going because there's so much guilt for this feeling, I keep going for my family, I keep going so maybe I can help someone else get through. 

Our worth is so tied up in money, status, ""love"", and if we think we don't have those things we feel outcast. I know I feel useless and a waste to society most days. I've tried to contribute, but I'm not good enough. 

I'm not really sure if this is true, but to the core of my being there is always something that says ""You matter"" and I want to tell others here that same thing, you matter, you are enough, you are meant to be alive. Keep up the fight, though everything in my mind and body are telling me to give up, its not my time yet, it's not your time yet. For whatever reason you're still here fighting. 

Way to go I'm proud of you! I know it's so hard. You're reading this though and that's more than a lot of people can say.

laimonade,2022-02-28 15:07:15+00:00,Living through crisis,"My girlfriend is living through the worst depression, physical chronic pain and crisis in her life and I am living together with her. Looking  for advice here how we could get out of this situation.

I am desperate for something that would help her, any tips or knowledge that you have and are willing to share would be so much appreciated. 

Maybe a short backstory would help.
We have been living together for 4 years now and short after moving in together she had a sudden dizziness attack, something vertigo-like, fell on the floor and she would feel all sorts of pain in the head, neck and body areas since. Everyday she feels bad. We have tried to find answers from doctors but with no real success There is no formal diagnosis of her disease so it is all very uncertain. 

Well, after all this time of feeling all these things she developed a health anxiety which resulted into a major depression.
I should note that before the dizziness attack she was living a normal life, had energy to do things. But now it's all changed. She cannot get up from bed because if she does she risks falling down, feeling dizzy or nauseous so the answer often is to lay in bed to feel less pain. But as you can imagine it causes so many more problems like feelings of uncertainty, meaninglessness, lack of energy, isolation, loneliness, suicidal thoughts.  Life is too overwhelming for her.

The questions is how to even wake up? Why wake up when you feel so miserable? You have too much going on in your head, in your body and life, so many things have to be done, and the only solution is to fall asleep again. She could sleep all day and sometimes she does.  She is completely out of the rhythm with no sleep pattern- not being able to sleep in the night she copes by watching TV shows or doing research on health and other things- then finally falls asleep about 10 or 12 am from exhaustion, sleeping throughout the day. Even when she tries to sleep she can't. She has too many thoughts. Any stress and pain makes it worse. It's a vicious cycle- the more she sleeps the more it hurts and vice versa.

The problem is that it is both physical and also psychological pain and I am aware there is no one simple answer to cure it all. It is very complicated. 

It's been long 4 years with no real results, her health is getting worse and I am worried that I am not doing enough to help her.

Thank you."

I've been taking Effexor + other  mood regulators for my long-lasting depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I just added a few days ago Xanax (Alprazolam) 2 to 3 mg a day.

I was wondering if in addition to its immediate effect, Xanax could also be a background treatment that helps to overcome those troubles in the long-term - let's say for instance 2-3 weeks or more, or if it is just a symptom-based medication that helps day to day, each time you take it.

Thanks in advance for you answers"

Piggy2473,2022-02-28 02:22:06+00:00,Senior year of high school and suicidal thoughts,"So I have had family issues since before I started high school like my house burned down three years and we were practically homeless issues. When I was going to freshman year my mom took us to an expensive private school, I immediately did not do well. On top of that my mother found out I was dating someone of a different race and kicked me out along with a lot of other shit (I don't feel like saying anymore abt this). It left me traumatized but I suppressed it up until recently. I started failing and multiple times all my teachers met about how to help me, I did better but not well. I was never asked about my mental health or the fact I might have a learning disability because my mother blamed it on me being ""lazy"" which I am (she was there for all the meetings) I passed with a 1.64 GPA in a school with $40,000 tuition. My sophomore year was the same I was still lost and just got broken up with by a boyfriend and again suffered hell only then did covid come. I honestly liked the fact I could be alone even though it was with my family. I still didn't do well and had a 2.0 GPA. No one asked questions and I assume it was because well covid. Junior year I matured a lot and did A's and B's in almost all my classes, I stopped socializing and finally felt like myself I left with a 3.64 GPA.

Now senior year. I matured a lot and started realizing the real issues within my family which are super deep-seated. It has taken a pretty harsh toll on me. My mother is in college and has a full-time job and is stressed, my father is overwhelming depressed as he has always been. I am the oldest of the children and therefore I am an adult I feel like I take care emotionally of my parents (both are immature and fight every day) and my siblings. I have to mediate everything and raise basically everyone, I have to be strong and look after them. The moment I got my license I became my ambitious brother's driver for my parents while he worked a job. I started the year ok and found my passion for Art. I also got diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed meds, they don't really help.

However academically I faltered. Traumatic events for my whole class happened with a threatening note. I also found out that I was being sexually harassed (I didn't know the meaning so I had just rubbed it off) by someone for the last two years. On top of that tensions in my household rose and I wake up every morning to my parents fighting. I also have to deal with my siblings who are so scarred they are worse than I am I have to be their emotional rock. I have to hold them when my parents fight, I have to calm them down. During Christmas break after the traumatic note, I rested for a bit and focused on a portrait I was working on, I was happy. After break school started and a new semester. My grades immediately went down and I stopped working, we have a senior thesis that is required to graduate and I stopped working on it. I am failing most classes and I haven't slept more than 6 hours in forever. The thing is I just can't do work, my brain won't let me. I am so overwhelmed that it has led to depression the suicidal thoughts which have always been there are getting worse, I also started cutting. This made me come to the revelation I have been self-harming since I was a child, I remember banging my head on the counter or wall or pulling my hair when working on school work. Or scratching myself when I was overwhelmed. I don't think I will graduate but my school doesn't care and it's killing me. I remember asking a teacher if they ever had an issue with mental health and senior thesis and she said we haven't before. I also remember asking about anxiety attacks during presentations (because every time I think of it I have an anxiety attack) and she told me once someone cried and they helped her during the presentation she still had to do it. It's eating me up that if I tell them they wouldn't do anything, because it seems to me that people with mental health issues still get it done. So I feel like mine are not important enough because apparently everyone else has strived but I feel like I cant. I know that if I told them they would tell my parents and that too would kill my parents. Especially my dad who lost his sister young. I still care for them even though I have gone through so much and I want to make them proud. I honestly don't know what do to because no one knows about my issues and I have been told I don't seem like one with them. It just sucks and it is again killing me."

Even before that, at the start of Covid I lost a parent, lost my car in an accident, and lost my job I’d had for 3 years. Needless to say, the depression id been living with my whole life and finally starting to get some control over worsened since 2020. To the point I’ve considered ending things twice in two years.

I told her all this expecting her to leave or end things and miraculously she didn’t.

DevTheDummy,2022-02-27 05:36:47+00:00,"My life is falling apart, I want to kill myself, and I can't even tell anybody","My mom is dying of huntington's disease and is losing her sanity right in front of me while my dad is short tempered and constantly working I'm so fucking done. Only thing keeping me from doing it rn are my little siblings who only really have me left and my friends who are really the only things who bring me happiness anymore.

My dad isn't supportive of mental health issues because he had a very bad upbringing and is very close minded, and the last time I told my mom about my suicidal thoughts was during a breakdown and she screamed at me, almost forced me into a shitty mental hospital, and then had the nerve to cry to me about how bad I was making HER feel as if I wasn't having the worst night of my entire life. I'm constantly bullied for my interests and appearance by my dad who brushes it off as ""playing"" because that's how he was raised (even though it's not an excuse). I can't talk to a guidance counselor because then they'll tell my parents about what I said, and I can't get therapy because my dad isn't supportive of mental health even though he probably has a lot of issues himself.

I've been sexually assaulted at school and outside of school but I can't tell authorities because then they'll tell my parents who will freak out and take away the little freedom I have because to them that's a solution. A boy at schoo invited me over to his place to potentially rape and maybe even murder me but I can't tell an adult because then it'll get back to my parents and I don't want that. The good is not outweighing the bad in this situation so I quite literally had to suck it up and deal with it, which only enables people to use me more.

I can't do anything without thinking of that stupid fucking disease and how I have a 50% chance of dying of it. I'm so fucking done, everything is spiraling downhill and out of control. I'm 14, why do I have to go through this now? I want to run away with my siblings and get out because all my parents ever do is scream at each other  whenever my dad's home. I love my parents but I hate it lore.

I've always wanted to have children so I could give them a good, happy life but now I may not even be able to do that because if I'm HD+ I don't want my kids to have to deal with a mother just like mine. They would deserve better than that and I would rather jump off of a bride with weights attached to my angles than put a child what I'm going through right now.

I can't tell my friends because they're struggling too and they rely on me to be the mentally stable one and would only feel guilty if they knew about what I'm going through.

Of course, I can't leave because then I would be ostracized by the rest of my family and our family friends for being ""ungrateful"" for everything my parents have done for us as if these people fucking live with us and know what goes down. Of course, it isnt their fault because my parents paint a picture perfect image in front of everybody and dont even let me tell my closest friends about anybody in my family having huntington's disease because they're so fucking ashamed. The rest of my family and our family friends are the only safety net I really have and I can't lose that because then I'll have no where to go.

I have no way out of this and that alone makes me so fucking mad and depressed."

I know I shouldn't fell that way because being jealous won't help. But it's a reminder of how lonely I feel"

I have had this one question for very long time. I sleep for about 7-8 hrs at night but even after getting up in morning I feel extremely tired. Extremely like hell a lot tired. My eyes are like by 11 AM I start feeling tired, like I don't want to do anything and my eye just starts shutting down again.

I get ready by 10 AM for job and fyi I work as a software engineer and make a good amount enough to survive and feed my stomach. I work around 8 hrs at max. I always feel like sleeping. I don't get whats making me so tired. I don't enjoy life in general and avoid any new relations/people and like to be alone.

So I ask this question to you all, why do I feel so tired?"
lostintheuniverse_,2022-02-26 15:16:21+00:00,in a bad moment. wrote a bunch of stuff down to vent and just wanted to put it out there,"I've battled with depression for a long time and have my ups and downs and one of the ways I deal with it is to write stuff down. Wanted to know what it would feel like to share it with people.   


*The Door*

I feel so lonely

Lifes a journey

So much sadness, so much pain

What is the point

Do I smile, do I laugh

Is it real, is it fake

No one knows

What is the point

I stand alone

Looking at the door

&amp;#x200B;

*Rain*

Today it is pouring

Is there a puddle to be found

Delirious from depression

O look over there, a pond to be found

Standing on the ledge

The end is nigh, I dive in

Pop goes my neck

The end

&amp;#x200B;

*J*

Beautiful perfection

Every day I see

Tease to the soul

Promise of happiness

Meaningless chatter

Is she happy

Doubt creeps in

The journey continues

With no path to be found

I try I try I try

But I am broken

I wish I was different

I wish I was normal

But o no, not me

I talk, she talks

We look, we smile

The possibilities draw closer

But none for me

Like a string It keeps going

the cat and the mouse

the teeth or the tail

which one am I

none, nil, zip

I wish I was high

Pain shall dissipate

But tomorrow comes

Beautiful perfection

Every day I see

Tease to the soul

Happiness never comes

&amp;#x200B;

*Dreams*

Skin so soft

Smile so divine

Like a bubble you are

Please let me catch you

Just like a shooting star

You shine so bright

I see you everywhere

Eyes wide, eyes shut

Shall not matter

Why can’t I escape

Star in the sky

When your around

My soul shines

You complete me

I am happy

If only the truth

&amp;#x200B;

*Black Hole*

The black hole is consuming

But where does it come from

Not from the sky above

Or the galaxy far away

It comes from within my heart

The emptiness it seeps through

It consumes my whole essence

What is the point of it all

When the darkness shall prevail

How do I defeat the black hole

Do I even bother trying

To stand in front of the enigma

To face it or to fall

Only I can decide with the essence of my soul

But what if its to late to be saved

What if the darkness has consumed it all

What if there is no going back

What if this my existence till the end of times

What will I be remembered for

The black hole in my heart or the fleeting moments of it all

&amp;#x200B;

*Do I Matter*

Who thinks about me

Does anybody care about me

Am I an after thought

Do I come first anywhere

Maybe I do, maybe I don’t

Existence is futile

When you feel alone

Am I an after thought

I just want to be loved

I just want to be loved

I just want to be loved

Where does love come from

Does it even exist

What does it feel like

Is dopamine love

Forever I chase

Never to arrive

People around me everywhere

But I am nowhere to everyone

I hope not

But feels so

Emptiness

Emptiness

Emptiness

Hug me please

&amp;#x200B;

*U&amp;R*

To the people of Ukraine

I stand by you today

In the midst of tragedy

The bald fraud marches on

Forever speaking lies

But facing lies also

Who to blame

Please save the innocent

I cry with you tonight brothers and sisters

You are all the same as me

What if I stood by you tonight

Would I do the same

Please end this tragedy

I repeat

Please end this tragedy

The people of this world are oblivious

I still have hope for us

The flame shall never die out

As long as love stands strong

I hope for a better tomorrow

Please world

Heal

&amp;#x200B;

*The Forest*

What is the point of existence

What is the purpose of it all

Is it to feel something on the path

What if the path goes no where desirable

Did I really have a choice on this journey

There are no turns but can I sway

I try to lean left

I try to lean right

But the path continues straight into hell

The path cannot be changed

The forest must stand strong for the seed to grow

Only if the surroundings permit so do we succeed

Does that mean we have a choice in it all

What is the point of existence then

Maybe I am wrong in my perception

But maybe my forest fire created this

I wish I grew in the garden of Eden

For then my potential would have been reached

But for now I am wondering in the darkness

Walking through the forest in my dreams

Hanging onto the trees hoping for a better day

When I wake up I realise I am stuck in the fire

Forever I shall burn for my forest was not adequate"

Powerful-Talk435,2022-02-26 14:56:21+00:00,Just a thought i need to release,"- None of your help matters unless it's money. No, effort alone will not be recognized.
- None of your hard work matters. If they see you enjoying something, they'll think you are wasting 100% of your time on it and label you as lazy and disregard all the good things you did to earn that alone time you tried to work for.
- I've realized that majority of people look for someone to blame when things go wrong, and that person will be you.  And then you, being a quiet and kind-hearted soul, accepts it so you could put these people at ease.

I stay up late because I like things quiet and peaceful. But when I wake up, I'll just get labeled as an addict over something that gives me an escape from depression.

Thank you for this secret space where i can release my thoughts. I want to be well. I want to accomplish things too but i just don't have the desire to achieve something great in public just to be treated better. I just want to live in peace and do my part. I have a heart, but people always use it as a punching bag, airbag, or a stool to stand on so they can feel great. I hope one day i get the confidence to claim great things for myself instead letting people take it from me after i worked hard for it."
VillageWaifu,2022-02-26 14:40:21+00:00,It’s been a while since I’ve posted,"I used to frequent this Reddit a lot in my past, generally just giving my two cents for others. I thought that I finally got away with this feeling of self hate and loathing, the cycle of depression that we’re all trapped in. I even had a therapist! I see now that there’s no escape, my step brother found my crossdressing account that I stupidly made on instagram, at least I believe so. It wasn’t a very sfw account and now I’m even more of a freak to my parents, I’m just that weirdo 28 year old that can’t even act like a man. They know my dark secret and what’s worse they know I’m chronically pleasuring myself (which is what I do when I’m depressed). My life is just a joke now, I feel alone, I feel like a freak and I know my step mother feels disgusted around me. I really feel bad for my dad, who looks like he tries to treat me like I’m still a person. I’m reality I’m a freak, I’m disgusting and I wish that I wasn’t born. If my step brother finds this somehow, then you can tell them about this too. It’s not like they want to be near me anymore anyways."
Dear-Bottle3362,2022-02-26 10:43:59+00:00,everyone thinks I’m fine so I should be fine right?,"I have a roof over my head, a job (that I actually kind of really hate), a supportive family, but I’m still so unhappy. Most days I dread going to work, and when I am at work I’m looking forward to my days off so I can just sleep and be alone. I have this mentality that I need to save up for my future and start getting my shit together like move out of my parents house (I’m 22 y/o) but honestly I think I’m more miserable because nothing in life excites me anymore. There is nothing that makes me feel truly happy &amp; when there is, that rare glimpse of happiness it is so far out of my reach it saddens me even more because I can’t get a hold of it. My life is just one bland, emotionless story."

I just feel like that I’m very hopeless ,helpless, and just empty inside. I’ve been wanting to end myself ever since then. I don’t know though; I’ve always been a happy and playful person my life.

Because of this I was let go today. I've been trying a function as a normal person for the longest of time but some days I have zero energy to even face the world or even get out of bed. I was fired through a voicemail but my boss told me to feel free to come to work the next two days becuase Im on the schedule, so now I do not have a job on literally a three day notice.

grey-cats,2022-02-25 19:26:38+00:00,"Covid positive, UK so no restrictions, boyfriend won't see me. Feeling very alone right now.","Sorry if this is long or doesn't make sense, I'm writing this through floods of tears. 

I'm aware I probably sound really selfish right now, but I tested positive this morning (Friday), the day I usually go to my boyfriends house for the weekend.

I'm not ill, no symptoms, I just have to do regular LFD tests due to my job.

I'm from the UK so as of yesterday we have no legal duty to self isolate or stay away from people.

I'm now really upset that my boyfriend won't come to my house to see me, he's spent all day messaging me here and there (he was at work so I couldn't have his full attention), at one point he'd say things that made me think he was gunna come and see me. Then in the next message he'd say stuff that made me think the opposite.

I've been on high alert anxiety wise all day, because of these mind games....my head is a constant ""will he? Won't he?""

My paranoia is telling me that he doesn't want to see me and wants a weekend to himself, and that he'll realise its better without me. So I'm in a panic about that too.

He got home from work 2 hours ago and went straight out to dinner with his family, so I still haven't been able to talk to him properly and right now that's all I want to do, I just want an hour of his full attention to talk. I asked him is we can talk properly when he gets home and he says he'll call me later. Meanwhile I'm having panic attacks with no one to talk to.

I know for a fact if things were the other way around and he had covid, I'd definitely be there by his side whether he was ill or not, it's still a scary prospect. I'd want to comfort him, but it's been 9 hours since my result and I feel like I've been his last priority all day, even on his lunch break it took him ages to reply to my messages.

Feeling very alone right now."
Lesbian_chick,2022-02-25 16:46:15+00:00,I'm 24 and I screwed my life up,"I’m a 24 year old female and I’m slowly giving up.

I just downloaded reddit so I can post this and get it off my chest.

Before reading this, I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me, I know I have brought this whole situation upon myself. 

I’ve been taking care of my 6 younger siblings, my mum and my grandmum mostly financially but also in other aspects of their lives from the time I was a little kid. I’ve been working from the time I was 12 to help my family with our struggling finances and I even attempted to go to university for a while but every-time I sat down to study, my mom (who has never finished high school) keeps reminding that instead of sitting and “wasting time”, I should get more hours at work so I can bring home more money. I’ve worked multiple jobs over the years and sometimes 2-3 jobs at the same time. 

Before the start of the pandemic I accepted a job in Venezuela that had great pay but when the pandemic hit, they didn’t renew my 6 month contract. Because I am out of a job, I've been living on the streets for almost 2 years, my family doesn’t know and quite frankly, I don’t think they care. 

Just when I though things could get any worse, on Christmas Day 2020 I was robbed and my backpack was taken that contained all my documents and bank card. I can't get new bank cards because I don't have any documents. 

Adoption of Bitcoin is widespread in Venezuela and so I've been lucky that most people pay me in Bitcoin and most corner stores and supermarkets accept Bitcoin. 

I’ve visited the embassy that is closest to me so they can help me get back home but it's been a long and hard process because I don't have any documents on me. 

I try to have a bath almost everyday and brush my teeth daily so I can look presentable to increase the chance of a potential employer noticing me and offering me a job and also because I've learnt very quickly that if you look homeless you're easily ignored 

I’ve taken out countless loans from a well known loan shark in the area to help me get by when I don’t make enough money during the month from the odd jobs and also to send money back home to my mum and siblings because they won't survive without my assistance. I can't always afford to pay on time so they often force into a quite room to pay part of the interest with my body. I'm not the type of person to sell my body for money but even if I did, I would never make up the $65000 that I owe the loan shark, I've had 4 abortions over the last year and a half because of this. (I don't want a lecture telling me how abortion is wrong so you can save those comments for your small talk after your Sunday church service) 

I love my family and want to provide for them despite everything but I’m emotionally, mentally and financially drained.

The only thing that’s keeping me going at the moment is a scruffy looking street dog I named Rocky that has been following me around and sleeps wherever I sleep. Before I met this dog, I contemplated offing myself on a daily basis but now with the dog, I don't think about it as much. There are days when I do think about offing myself but Rocky just looks at me like, ""who's going to feed me?"" and then I just can't do it. As I'm typing this, he saw me getting emotional and climbed onto my lap to keep me company.

Even if my situation never gets better, I'm a little relieved that I got this off my chest."

It's like I'm on autopilot. Wake up super late. Sleep till afternoon  and bing on Instagram and Netflix. I hate eating. I feel feel alone even though I have huge support from my family. I hate studying. Feel like burning books. I think about extreme graphic and horrible imagery everyday about the whole just imploding in on itself. So much death and suffering.

sadly i’m really not making progress, it’s my fault. in a way it feels like i’m letting her down, but it’s just her job and i know she’s seen it all. im supposed to drive downtown to get a rope on saturday. i’ve messed up a lot in life, some mistakes are probably unforgivable, i deserve to die. and it’s all i want. even if it scares me. i need to at least try, even if hell is real and i go (please no 😓), at least i took initiative and control over ending my life. i don’t need any comments or advice, just wanted to write it out. i’m so close to giving up and i hope i end things soon .💗"

I just want to remind you that this feeling is temporary and that I know this is something I’ll have to live with the rest of my life but I’ve learned that it’s best to enjoy the moments when I’m not depressed and to not be so harsh on myself even in my darkest moments. You have to be understanding to yourself and not best yourself up all the time. Ik sometimes your mind is just filled with all these negative emotions and thoughts that are hard to control but even those thoughts are temporary. 

Even now that I’m doing better I still have small moments where I just can’t stand being myself. But I just let myself go through all the emotions I’m having. I also journal my emotions bc I’m not a fan of talking about my emotions 😬"

Which for anatamy and physiology feels impossible. 

Raising our 8 month old daughter who naps 1 time a day, very active and very much needs constant Interaction

My boyfriend and I have a very stressful relationshit that honestly I would leave if I wasnt financially dependent, hence trying to turn my life into something with school. He is very opposite of me and needy like our daughter, but he is a grown man. 

I no longer have a car which happened right after giving birth, so I feel I've lost my independence as well as become isolated.

So if we go anywhere or do anything it's ""as a family""

We have closely family but they almost never are up to helping watch her.

I feel like a hollow person. I can't seem to smile, focus, or be happy most of the time. I can't sleep well. I constantly just want to pause life. I don't know how to function anymore. Not to mention my sense of humor is gone. I don't think it helps that I am with a misogynistic narcissist who blames me for everything. My self esteem is wrecked and I don't feel inspired or creative with anything anymore. Life feels like a never ending chore sucking everything I have and asking for more when I'm empty."
ZakLCM,2022-02-24 21:39:40+00:00,Fuck this shit,"I have pretty much dropped to an all time low. It's fucking horrible to live in. I have everything set up to die already. What is the point of living, wake up everyday to work, have your money taken away just for living, face a living cost crisis, war is starting. I just want to do something I enjoy not be forced into something or otherwise be punished and stared at in disgust. 

Waking up every morning is hard. Going to school is hard. Scared in my own home that if I don't live up to my parents expectations I'll be punished, yelled at and be a disappointment. I don't even feel like I'm living sometimes. I've lost all motivation in anything. I hate how I look. I hate who I am. I'm conflicted about what I want to be. I'm afraid of the comments people will make if I expressed my sexuality and the struggles I'm facing with it. I feel judged about anything I do. But I've strangely come to feel more comfortable in these feelings than just telling someone and being happy with everything. I don't even know what it feels like to be happy anymore. I don't remember a time when I was happy with anything. 

I just want to stare at the sky, listen to some music and slowly die.

But then I saw this video and i felt kind of sick - the guy I looked up to was shown to be monstrous! And yeah perhaps there's more to the video and this is just a snippet of the full truth but I still can't help but feel lost - this made me question whether or not I can ACTUALLY get to where I want to be or if socialogically speaking im stuck in poverty. I crave SO bad to get tf out of my situation but I feel I've been swindled. I feel undeserving sometimes - and maybe bc I am undeserving sometimes. I've got skeletons in my closet I'm sure many others do, but one of these skeletons..i just feel like destroyed me. That I cannot be the same person I was - my moral code has been violated and it's so hard to forgive myself. I deserve this dread for my actions, I do what I can to try to make things right. I've cleaned alot of my skeletons out (ex. In grade school I made a rumor that I slept with some girl - recently I came up to her and told her the truth (I'm 22) I no longer suffer the pain of that lie, I am 100% honest with that subject) there are reasons I made the rumor that might even give sympathy to me but let's not go into that, the point is - I am actively trying to clean out my closet, yet I make stupid decisions that just add to the mess and before you know it my closet has more skeletons than I had before. I understand that time heals wounds, but this time I don't feel that is the truth. I'm stuck in poverty and I'm constantly reminded that there's no way out, there was a time I felt I could escape but I feel my actions are making me undeserving of escape in which further drag me to my hole."

I told her how I felt when she was happy and proud of my sister and that she didn't even care about me lately, and that I feel too much presure in school, and that she never said something good about me, and you guessed it.. she denied this shit with cold blood, she said that She was proud of me for doing a ""medium-good"" job in school, and that she talked yesterday about how I'm perfect and stuff to other family members and that she's really proud of me, when in reality.. I was with her the whole day and she didn't talk about how ""she was proud"" of me at all Lol, I mean at least try to make a smart and genius lie mom.. I mean I'm not saying that she never EVER said something ""good"" about me, but she briefly mentions good things I do.

 So I told her that I was with her the whole day and bla bla.. and she denied Lol like wttffff mom, really?.. And then she changed the subject about how I should put MORE hard work, wish I'm not mad about, she's right, BUT at least maybe you can help? I told her how much I need her help and she said that she's already helping.. BRUH WHAT???? helping with what? sitting around and telling me about how I'm a disappointment everytime she gets a chance?? Like everytime she had an argument with someone she would be mad at me for nothing bruh.. Okay now I'm getting confused.. I honestly never stoped loving mom, but showing her how much I love her and how much I need her.. It's what's getting me nowhere.. 

However I'm NOT saying she doesn't love me or anything, and I'm NOT blaming her and acusing her of making my anxiety and my depression worse, I just need her to care, and I know she does not have much time for me and stuff because she's busy with her work and cooking and cleaning.. but at least just hanging out with her would be enough for me because I know I'm not living too long, I'll be gone, I need to spend my last days with her.. 

But it's really late, I've fucked up.. I used to be the smartest kid in school when I was a lot young but now growing up, I'm getting worse, I'm afraid of my future and I know people saying that ""it's gonna get better"" but where? ..

 Instead of doing something good and helpful in my life, I'm here listening to music and writing shit that nobody would even recognize, I'm gonna fail in my life anyway so why not kill myself?.. I guess I'm too afraid to do so, and that i still have ""hope"" for things to change for the better including me, I don't think so, I'm a failure, a disappointment :)"

'Oh everyone feels that way'
'Thats a normal reaction'
'I felt that way too, once'

How can you say that when I confessed to almost cutting myself with something sharp only a few hours ago? For context, we were talking about organising therapy and she asked me how im feeling mental health wise  (which is rare, honestly). And I said, okay- but my anxiety has been elevated lately due to work, im struggling to sleep. 

'Oh that's normal, most people feel that way when they start  a new job'

'I can't sleep from the intrusive thoughts'

'Ah, thats not so normal i guess'.

*silence*


Thats how it goes everytime. Its took so much for her to understand that I am struggling. I know she loves me lots and I love her too, but her attitude hurts me and when I try to express that I'm met with shrugs and a stiff 'alright then, I won't say that'. Not to mention it's so hard opening up about being queer. It all feels so stiff and awkward. She seems to dismiss anything she is not comfortable with, which is a common reaction but it hurts me. She doesn't seem to think she's doing anything remotely like that, but after we talk im always left feeling anxious and afraid, like she would have preferred I hadn't said anything to begin with.

DescendingTitan,2022-02-23 03:43:00+00:00,I used to read.,"I used to have hobbies and I just don’t feel the same way. Things don’t appeal to me like they used to. I was an avid reader as a child. I had a 12th grade reading level in the first grade, and now I barely read for pleasure. I’m 25 and student teaching and it’s just horrible. I walk into a book store and just get sad. Nothing seems interesting or worth the money and I feel ashamed. I made myself get a paper back copy of Dune, because an old friend enjoyed it and I wanted to connect with him again, but he doesn’t even reply to my texts. So here I am on page 10 of apparently a great book but I feel nothing yet. 

I used to enjoy going for walks too. My girlfriend loves going outside and I want to want to, but I just feel like I’m not being productive, I’m just going. The same streets in the same town. Maybe there will be a deer or something but ultimately I’m not going anywhere or doing anything, I’m just killing the day, so I can go to bed in another February night, so I can wake up at 6:00 am and leave my warm bed to drive a half hour away and teach music to children for no pay. Actually I’m paying $6000 this semester. The kids don’t appreciate it, my mentor is a conservative old man, the other teachers don’t respect me. I guess I’m getting better at teaching and conducting but it’s miserable.

I used to enjoy music, and I even got my own bassoon. I put on a great recital and I lost 70 pounds and I have a great living situation but I just don’t feel happy. And all I can think is to be ashamed, because I should be. I’m very lucky for my parents to be alive, and to have a nice house and a warm bed and to get a 4.0 for the first time ever and to be ready to graduate but I do not see a light at the end of this tunnel. I dread tomorrow. There’s nothing to do in this town. I don’t know why I don’t want to walk or practice or read. I want to want to, and the fact that I don’t makes me hate myself. I miss my friends who all graduated without me and the few close ones moved away. They’re too busy to talk. I hate this. I’m powerless."
mayitasteyourpasta,2022-02-23 02:12:17+00:00,I need to admit that I'm not okay,"Like seriously I'm not okay.

It's not okay to hate people and think everyone is bad.

It's not okay to not have had any friends for years.

It's not okay to have no social interaction outside of reddit and work.

It's not okay to feel like you're not sure if you want to stay with your wife or get a divorce.

It's not okay to tell yourself maybe if you were with someone else you'd be happier.

It's not okay to take it personally everytime someone disagrees with you online. 

It's not okay to live every day feeling like your trapped but not do anything to fix things.

It's not okay to hate the house you live in.

It's not okay to just want to run away and leave everything behind.

OneOnOne6211,2022-02-22 23:50:00+00:00,Just Depressed And Wanting to Talk About It Somewhere,"Basically, I'm depressed and I have nobody to talk to about it right now so I guess I'll just post about it here.

I've been struggling on and off with depression since I was 16. I'd say about half of the years since then I've been depressed, usually in chunks. I've thought about killing myself pretty often over the years. And I've entered yet another depression now.  

The thing is that my current situation is bad.  

I struggle with several anxiety disorders which made college very difficult. I tried to struggle through college to get my diploma for several years but in the end I just had to give up because I knew if I continued it would result in me killing myself because of how badly it affected my mental health. 

I'm currently unemployed with no reasonable way to get a job I might in any way enjoy or be okay with. 

I love writing and have loved it for many years and my dream is to become a professional novelist, however I've been struggling with completing my first novel for a long time now. Worse, because of how depressed I've been feeling over the last month or two, I've barely been able to write. I basically can't even muster the energy for that.

I was actually already on the precipice of depression by December but in early January the girlfriend I'd been with for 6 years, whom I loved a lot, whom I thought I would marry and have children with, broke up with me too. And that basically pushed me over the edge into a full on suicidal depression. 

She was basically the only part of my life that still made me happy to be alive and so now I have nothing. Actually, it's worse than nothing because now it hurts constantly because I feel incredibly heartbroken. Maybe some people can do it but for me it's not so easy to just forget about or lose my feelings towards someone I was with for 6 entire years of my life. I still love her except now instead of it being the one thing in my life that made my life worth living, it just causes me more pain. 

I've tried joining a dating site but, honestly, that's going terribly too. Barely getting any matches or responses. I think I've had like 2 genuine conversations in almost a month of trying. Not to mention it's really hard to even talk to these people when I have social anxiety which makes it stressful and on top of that I constantly feel like shit. 

On top of that I naturally have a pretty high libido. So the inability to have sex with anyone has also been driving me crazy. Exacerbated by the fact that I only want to have sex with people I'm emotionally close to, I wouldn't want to have sex with a stranger or a prostitute or something. I want that intimacy and I miss that a lot too. 

So to sum up: I've been fighting my depression and anxiety for years now and yet I'm worse off than when I started. I have no job. I have no future prospects of any kind. My anxiety has gotten worse again after a time of improvement. I don't really have any money. I miss the person I was with a lot and my heart is broken. I'm having no success finding someone new, nor do I really expect that to turn around. In fact, because of how bad I feel I can barely put in the effort. My writing (which is my dream) is something that hasn't been moving forward and something I barely have the energy to even work on anymore due to how depressed I feel. 

Overall I'm completely miserable, I'm tired of fighting just to end up worse off anyway and I think about ending my life pretty much every day, often many times a day. I honestly just don't see the reason to live anymore and, in fact, with the break-up I'm in almost constant pain and spend like half the day wanting to cry. 

Oh, and I have nobody to talk to about any of these feelings on top of that."

Anxiousfox101,2022-02-22 23:12:36+00:00,Came up with a cool idea for suicide,"So, I recently found out you need to be 21 to buy a gun, I’m not 21. So, I was like damn. I can’t shoot myself now. But, I was looking in to poisoning myself and I thought of maybe just trying to drink 10 monster energy drinks and maybe I would die, and while I was researching it, I found out if you eat around 85 chocolate bars, it can be lethal. So, I think one day, when I want to kill myself, I’ll get 100 chocolate bars, a chocolate cake, a dozen chocolate donuts, and some Monster and a high sugar latte to wash it all down. Hopefully that will cause cardiac arrest, a fatal seizure, or something to that effect. If that doesn’t work, I guess I could always use pills or something."

I hope there is a tiny piece of hope, love, laughter, or happiness that helps you keep going. And I hope one day you will find the most true, genuine, sincere love that anyone can find. A kind of love that would immediately pull you out of every single struggle you’re facing. Whether that be a person, a passion, or anything for that matter. Because you deserve it. You absolutely deserve to be happy, full of life and full of hope."

la_vie_rosies,2022-02-22 18:58:30+00:00,Hello... again,"I dont know how many times have I posted something here but here I am again 

I am still not well. I still carry the burden of what people call ""move on, that's a long time ago."" I'm still hurting from the trauma someone put me through, I still feel betrayed and still blaming myself when people stopped talking to me. I still hate my parents for bringing me up to this world, for neglecting me and traumatizing me at an early age. I was forced to grow up, forced to forgive people who hurt me, and force to forget the things that left me hanging. It was all me. I am the only one I got.

Ever since I displayed my depression people stopped talking to me. I am left alone. Sometimes, I feel angry seeing them together, happy, free. Maybe because I am not there. 

I also dont have any plans for my future. I cannot even envision myself going on a year from now. I have nothing to look at. I have nothing to look forward to. I feel afraid at the same time calm. I dont really know where am I, emotionally. Most of the time, I am angry, or lonely, or both. I cannot see myself far from what am I right now. 

The only thing I want to look out for this time is my birthday. I'll be a year older. I hope I'll be happy that day. I want to feel different for once. Maybe, I'll go somewhere. Travel alone. Be away for a while. Maybe, or I hope maybe then, I'll try to think. Think for myself and try to feel different. Can I look forward for even the simplest times? Like weekend, a holiday, or a birthday. Just so I can feel different for some time. Not gonna lie, I wanted to be someone who lives a life to, I still want to hope that one day, I'll get better. My life will be better. But everytime I woke up, I dont have anything to make me feel something. I just want to be someone, to be contented with what I have, to trust people and make friends again, I want to love people too. I want to be better. If I could sell some parts of myself to exchange this anger and loneliness, I'd do it. I want to breathe again. I want to feel alive. I hope I'd get to that part of my life"

vendineverous,2022-02-22 17:36:57+00:00,Going to jail....probably,"I received a dui a year and a half ago (court date still pending because of covid- no evidence of drinking) and a hit and run a year ago (no evidence, lady lied and said I hit her and ran but there wasn't any impact) but still got arrested for some reason- court date pending) and a speeding ticket that I have to go to court to soon. 
It seems like I'm either going to jail probably if convicted because I can't afford a lawyer and/or going to losey drivers license. 
I just got a great job,  have paid off a lot of debt and might buy a house within a few months. 
But.....I might go to jail, get fired, get bad credit,  and lose all that including my kids.
Keeping a positive outlook on life is difficult when you know you're just going to jail at some point....probably."

The-Last-Nugget,2022-02-22 13:15:47+00:00,My social anxiety is coming back strong.,"2 years ago I found myself in debt. Debt collectors were banging on my door daily, one even waited for me to be outside before revealing himself (it was an obvious ambush).  It got to a point where I was scared to go out for groceries, if I did I made sure no-one was around before going to my backdoor, I kept the curtains closed and avoided doing anything that made sound. I even stayed frozen on the toilet, in the dark, because someone was at the front door.
I couldn’t answer the phone, I panicked whenever I heard a car or people walking around or talking outside and the postman became a boogeyman to me. 

I somehow got control of it and I was only mildly scared of random knocks on the door. 
But for some reason something has triggered me. I’m starting to panic at vans pulling up, I’m curtain twitching every-time I hear a voice outside and my chest knots up when I see high vis vests. It’s making me paranoid and I don’t know why. I have a toddler to take care of and a house to keep I can’t hide away like I did.  I can’t let this affect my son."

I even can understand this they don't wanna be soaked by sad or depressing facts they wanna have fun and nice talks. I don't know how it works. I only can fake it but it doesn't change anything.
Two years ago I wanted to become a normal person again I wanted friends and ppl around me but all I didn't in these two years is fake it until you make it just the make it part never came by. 
It's just exhausting and everytime I talk about this ppl are like don't be that weak everyone must have social skills it's needy for our life and system. And yeah our system works like that."

Choice-Brilliant-119,2022-02-22 06:02:23+00:00,Do I have an eating disorder?,I could go days without eating. Sometimes it’s because I’m too depressed to make myself food or I feel bad about my body. I feel like this all started because of my mom.. I know she is not fully to blame but she doesn’t care if I don’t eat some days. “you’re going to eat all that?” she says this all the time to me and it makes me not want to eat. I rush to my room with my food so she wouldn’t see how much food I have on my plate. She doesn’t make food for me unless I ask her to and it always feels like it’s too much for her to make food for me. I wish I didn’t have to go days without eating and I wish my mom cared enough to make sure if I’ve eaten. This has caused me to have a bad relationship with food. Sometimes I eat a lot of snacks and random things during the night because I’m usually depressed and it helps me cope I guess.
Internalizehatred,2022-02-22 05:31:55+00:00,Inspirational videos make me happy yet depressed.,"I watch these inspirational videos and they are truly inspirational and awe-inspiring and have alot of logical points. Yet because I've been depressed(depression,anxiety psychosis) I have no motivation or energy to pursue a better life,future or so forth. I dont even have college or university education and haven't worked in 6 years(I've been in and out of hospital for years and medication is hardly working but it's better than nothing).
Because of this mental illness I see no future or hope for myself and then I look at the world politically and socially(even on this site I got attacked by people who have the same politics as me which is funny but sad) and I get down hearted and even more damn depressed. I'm also very self-critical which isn't helping me at all.


Anyway the inspirational videos make me happy yet depressed at the same time, depression and myself have robbed me of myself....ironically I want this year to be my glow up year but its hard but  I'm not going to quit, I've just taken a little fall but I'll be back up!

sssstrikinglyAverage,2022-02-22 01:54:00+00:00,Lonely and depressed,"Feeling lonely and depressed. I have the desire to learn, build, and accomplish things in life but no motivation to go it alone with nobody else to share the experiences with. I live with my significant other and we have been together for almost five years but they just aren't interested in anything I am and vice versa. Almost all of my interests involve tech and I work with tech currently as well. I have nobody in my life whom I can share in my excitement. Heck, my significant other just seems to sit around for the most part watching TV and playing their Nintendo Switch all day after work. However, we aren't even interested in the same types of movies, shows, games, or even music as one another. I just feel I have nobody to share any of my interests with or to talk about what I've learned or accomplished without them being annoyed or looking confused or bored.

I've also been struggling to learn more and accomplish anything. Just cannot seem to stick to anything when I'm doing it alone and I have no idea where or how to find other people interested in the same things I am and with similar goals. Just feel stuck.

I like my job and where I live so there's definitely positives in life. Just struggle to make the connections I truly desire in the world. Does not help that I am introverted."
Chunkyboi01,2022-02-22 01:33:10+00:00,Hello again and goodbye,"This is my second post on this subreddit and my last one too, thanks to everyone for the support on my first post, it made me really happy seeing people say nice things to me for the first time in my life, but nice comments from internet strangers didn’t make my situation any better. In the time that I didn’t post anything I made a friend, Matt, Matt knew what I was going through and wanted to help me get out of my abusive home and to stop getting bullied at school constantly, my parents realized that we became friends thanks to the teachers who told them that they saw us hanging out, my parents didn’t know Matt’s intentions but still didn’t like the fact that i made a friend. Matt introduced me to some of his friends who I started hanging out with too, my parents hated the idea of me having multiple friends, so one day my parents came to my school and made the principal call Matt, his friends, and their parents to come to the principals office, I’m not sure what was said inside there but it made Matt and his friends never talk to me again and cut ties with me completely. I’m alone again, with no friends, no family and no one to trust, they just keep destroying my life little by little and tearing it apart, I don’t know why, I want to know why, I just can’t live like this anymore, I want to have peace, I want to rest even if it’s forever, I just want this to end, the only friends that I ever had got taken away by them and I don’t know why.

Have no idea what triggers these episodes or how long they'll last, but I sure am getting tired of them.

My parents split when I was around 4 and made me chose who I would go with, my mom asked so I went with her. My father was in my life very much, we would go almost every other weekend to my grandmas house together and I would spend my summers there. I developed anger problems around when I was around 6. I basically lived a double life, because at my dad´s it didn't come up, but I was in trouble a lot when I was at my moms. In early grades of school I was actually quite smart (I was the best at math in my class), but because of that I didn´t take school very seriously. I was also getting bullied, because I was basically the class clown and I would react.

At this time I felt my depression first show, getting out of bed was really hard and I was late almost every day (this came a joke in my class), after school I would just sit at my computer and I started eating a lot (I was a very skinny kid, but in a year I had become fat and had man boobs). I slowly started skipping classes. I got trough 6th grade, but in the 7th grade at one point I just stopped going. For almost a month I would just fake going to school. When my mom realised she made me go to my dads for the weekend, where we had a talk. I didn´t say the real reason and said I was being bullied (which was true, but it wasn´t the reason I stopped going). I still didn´t wanna go so, when they made me I ran away, I just needed some time to think. I ended up at a bridge and thought if I should jump. I was there until it was almost night and I decided I would try to just get trough it. I went to a different school and my depression started to get better. I started talking again with my friends from the old school and would game with them and I finished 9th grade.

For high school I decided to go back to the old school for (grades 10-12), because its an easy school and I thought I could work on my self, but then my depression came back strongly. I started skipping again and my grades are really taking bad. I basically wasted this half of a year. I have lost weight a lot ( I am 16y, 183.5cm/6feet and weigh around 63 kg, but 0 muscle). 

Now my parents told me to show that I have to get my shit together in 2 weeks or start looking for work."

account_thrown_away_,2022-02-20 23:00:17+00:00,A second letter,"I just wanted to write a post when I noticed that this account already has a post on this sub from one year ago. Fun to see that my condition hasn't improved since.

So, something about me: I'm 16, I have asperger's, trauma and some other random stuff. I'm also dealing with some illegal tendencies which I won't get into since I don't feel like making everyone here hate me and getting banned. This post might not be very readable since I'm just tired and don't feel like organising it much.

As a person, I am largely separated from my own emotions due to what I went through over the past few years. I was always passively fed high expectations, everyone always wanted me to do very well. So, I did. I did everything to do just that. It went to such lengths that I have some very old memories of wanting to just... essentially become a robot, not needing sleep or anything, maximizing efficiency and rate of improvement.

I went to a prestigiously-difficult middle school and eventually, it overwhelmed me. So... I pushed away my emotions and continued. Then, I pushed away other people as well. I started thinking purely logically and became completely out of touch with my emotions. I saw no reason to live as there is no happiness in an emotionless world, but I was still internally driven to improve and to survive... so I did. The quarantine gave me enough time to find many new hobbies and burn myself out of all of them in the span of a few months due to overworking. I hated my human body for being so weak and needing things such as sleep and rest.

I'm on high school now. Through a long series of events and thoughts, I finally partially accepted that I have to change my mindset since life without happiness has no meaning. Now, I'm sort of a split person, it feels like my emotional side and my logical side are apart. It's still difficult to tell what exactly I am feeling and usually it's also difficult to tell if I am feeling anything at all. People have told me it sometimes gives off the feeling that there's two different people in this body (no, I don't have DID, it's not that). It's extremely difficult for me to feel happy after all that happened, and I don't know how to recover from this.

=== Present

What used to help me escape from that state of emotionlessness was talking with friends, but now, that's not very possible. I was part of this irl friend group which particularly included my sister and my then-boyfriend. They were all very supportive as they were part of LGBT and were going through heavy stuff themselves.

One day, my mom was sent to the hospital and I was so stressed that I ended up spending like 16 straight hours calling with my best friend pseudo-therapist that I've known for ~2 years. It felt like it unlocked something in me. They were the only person that truly knew me because they were the only person that was ever willing to fully listen to what I had to say, so, when I was talking to them, I could just... say whatever I was thinking without wondering what sort of response that would get. I never really realised how much I was masking myself in front of other people before.

I realised that the feeling I felt towards my then-boyfriend wasn't love, just... surface friendship, I guess. I didn't understand what love meant back then since my emotions were confused. So, I tried to explain the situation to him smoothly, but, as I was ""pretty much the only person that cared for them"", it had a big effect on them regardless. They said stuff about me to people in the friend group and I was sort of cut out of it. Now everyone there hates me, for... I don't even know, I don't know what he told them.

My sister was always hell-bent on helping everyone around her, and now that the friend group is shaken by all this, everyone's coming to her and she's more exhausted than ever before. She can't bring herself to rest when there's sad people around her, so much so that she's becoming suicidal. And I can't even help because they all hate me. In the span of a few weeks, I lost all of my irl friends, and now I might lose my sister as well.

===

With emotions, it's often really difficult to just... tell what's real anymore. I'm not even used to listening to them and now that means that it's difficult for me to do so. You can't reach happiness by directly pursuing it. I don't know if any of you can even slightly relate to my story, but... I just wanted this to be out there, I guess. Thanks for reading through this."

Your bravest moment
One reason why you will succeed in college
A special encounter with an animal
A time when you felt out of place
The moment when you knew you were grown up
Your earliest memory of a holiday celebration
A time when you should have made a better choice
A proud moment when you did the right thing"

I am married to a man I love, but I don't feel loved back any more. I have no friends left, and this year none of my brothers, sister or dad even bothered to call me for my birthday. Instead of trying to comfort me my husband just got upset with me and said I must have done something wrong to upset them. That just made me cry more on my birthday, so he proceeded to get upset at me for crying. To top that off he really didn't try to make my day special. I got to order myself a small gift...with my own money. I know we are short on money right now, but when he spent nearly 500 on a mutual friends birthday, 1000 on siblings kids, thousands on his birthday, and even though I said it was too much he can do what he wants. Even a poem (which he is good at) or card would have made my day. I just don't matter.

I feel like I am worthless, selfish, and a bitch if I say anything. I don't know where to go from here. I cry all the time. I have hardly slept, but can't sleep because I start crying again. Now I work in an hour. Just a meaningless job that requires no skill or education, but it pays well for me. I can't keep doing this."

--Bouncy--,2022-02-20 02:13:02+00:00,Major depressive episode after feeling happiness. Why?," Hi. I'm 22M from the UK.

So for the past several years, I've been dealing with serious mental health issues. It started in 2019 when I was about 18. Without making it too long, I have had pretty severe depression, self harmed daily, and have wanted to commit suicide on a daily basis. This was my rock bottom, where I was from 2019 until about 1 year ago. Before I decided to try and help myself. So what I did was apply to University. I have had a number of traumatic events before 2019 as well, but this is just when the mental health issues began to start seriously affecting my life.

Now, even though I'm doing much better according to other people. And even though they tell me to be proud of it, I still feel just as fucked up. I'm now in my first year of University doing Music Performance. A passion I've always had, in between trying to survive. But I've come to realise that just getting up and moving hours away from home to study, doesn't make all the problems go away.

I'll be more specific. I've been having these episodes. These very very bad depressive episodes. They've happened enough times over the past few weeks, that I can sort of pin point how they happen. Like, they seem to only happen at specific times. They only happen, when I get really happy. Like, if I have a really good day, then later on I will want to fucking slit my wrists. And I will be filled with the most incredible amount of emotional pain imaginable and would do anything to make it stop. I will cry and cry and cry endless tears. I will not be able to sleep, because I just cry so much. I will also feel a lot of anxiety in my chest. Like, it feels like someone is pressing down really hard on it. Listen, I don't want to die, I just want to not suffer like this anymore. And sometimes suicide seems like the only option, and during these episodes its the only thing I can think about.

Now let me tell you the things that make me happy enough to cause these episodes. It honestly doesn't take much. It's mostly about people. I've been pretty much alone for as long as I can remember. Like, I'm not shy. I don't have social anxiety or anything like that. I just have a lot of defensives up. The few people I ever did let know the real me, inside. Usually ending up stabbing in the back, or leaving me. Or both. So talking to people and making friends makes me really happy. Playing music together and performing with those people also makes me happy.

However, I'm also scared. Like really fucking scared. Of those same people. I know I just said it makes me happy to be around them. But I'm also scared of connecting with them. A part of me doesn't want to. A part of me wants to stay locked up, hidden away. Because I'm fucking terrified of people getting to know me.

But as I said, later on I will have a major depressive episode. So if for example, one day I have a class where I get to talk to class mates or friends a lot. Then usually I will feel pretty happy. And I will feel really good about myself. But then later on I will feel extremely intense emotional pain, so bad that it makes me want to kill myself all over again.

I don't understand what the fuck I'm supposed to do. I'm here making an effort to be better. And yet, I'm getting punished for it. Every single time I feel some real happiness, I get kicked down and beaten to a pulp emotionally. It feels like I'm still stuck in that hole. That depressive pit. And everytime I try to climb up, by making REAL effort, I'm just thrown back down to the bottom. Why is my body so self destructive?

If anyone could tell me anything to help... I would really appreciate it."
evanie1337,2022-02-20 00:45:24+00:00,dumb,"
im gonna be honest i tried so hard to keep this structured but it just fell apart as usual. xx
all my grades are just terrible but i don’t even care about that, i’m in 10th grade, art school, “learning” music production
it’s my first year at this place, kinda famous in my country, kids from all over the country come just for this specific institution, it was surprisingly easy to get in, that doesn’t really matter i guess.
I was never particularly good at anything so when it came to switching schools for highschool, i didn’t know what to do.
I had no motivation, no interests, no friends, i was alone, and it’s still pretty much the same now. I started searching online for schools online but everything was so far away from home, i live in a shithole town with elderly people and can’t afford renting an apartment or something for studies. 
so one day my dad came up to me and showed me this place called JOBRA, a school that was generally focused on music, theater, yknow, art stuff. 
I knew about this place since i was like 5, it was very near our house, i could walk there on foot and it would take just 20 mins. pretty neat heh? 
I wasn’t convinced, everyday my dad would come up to me and ask me “have you signed up for an interview yet?” (i had to pass an interview to get in the school) i didn’t want to go, not that specific place, i didn’t know what school to pick, i didn’t wanna pick any.
i was doing a lot of music production at that time so my dad finally convinced and i signed up an interview for the music production course. 
It was done, i had signed up for a school that would control the 3 following years of my life. And of course, i passed the interview, blah blah blah. fuck this man i fucking despise this place and everyone in it. 
7 months in and it just keeps getting worse, i have this stomach thing that controls my body, makes me feel like im gonna blow up at any second and makes these weird gurgling noises. everyone just stares at me when this happens, how ridiculous. i guess the only positive aspect of this place is that i can go home to use the bathroom, i literally have lunch and breakfast on the toilet, my stomach hurts a lot and i have to shit all the time. i’m convinced i have some undiagnosed gastrointestinal disease that has been controlling my life for a little over 3 years now, but that’s not it yet. 
I spend my days at school trying to control my stomach and wondering when should i kill myself, or do i get out of this school and look for a better place if that’s even real. I don’t know if i should keep trying or just stop ya know? Like what’s the fucking point, i’m already here, what can i do now, in the eyes of the public i’m just another kid who does normal things like going to school and having no life, and maybe that’s true. 
When i’m not at school i’m always making music in my computer, always. I don’t do this professionally but one day i might, it’s all i can imagine myself doing, i don’t post nothing anywhere, i just keep working everyday to get better and better someday achieve something i’m proud of. 
Of course i’m not gonna be a musician, what kind of sick fuckin joke is that huh? Who isn’t a musician these days, it’s impossible to live off this shit now.
how can i survive, why"

I accidentally wrecked my car recently. My finances got wrecked from the car crash as well as unexpected expenses in life which leaves me at a total of 11k debt. Im a real estate agent where right now I hustle but my work goes nowhere as im new. I work part time in a restaurant that pays decent but not enough to cover being out from surgery and paying for the surgery. Its hard for me to get out of bed sometimes and my passions are on hold as I was always active and torn labrums stops you from doing alot. I have no Idea what to do. Like my whole life everyones always had loving families and a stress free life. All I wish is for one damn break. Just something good for once. I feel so down.

I was an honor roll student for like up until 8th grade (high school starts for 7th grade for me) , I'm been noticing feels of depression since 5th grade but I manged to hide them well for years until I reached a break point in 8th grade , it seemed like all these depressive episodes just built it and I reached a breaking point . I started self harm, stopped eating and doing chores, I would just lay down , cry and sleep to kill my depression . I did multiple sucuide attempts in 8-9 grade (i'm currently in 10th grade ) in 9th grade , I had a failing report card because of how distorted my mental health was and I promised myself I would do better in 10th grade , in 10th grade I got falsely accused for something I didn't do and went to jail missing alot of classes , I also hardly had any internet to do online classes worse, I had a person that threatened to reveal private stuff about me to everyone and I had to deal with abusive family members 
Now my mental health has plummeted , my grades had falling getting one of the lowest averages in the school. My teacher talked about it to me, I explained to her my issues and she just told me it's no excuse, the guidance counselor at my school also knows my issues but nobody seems to care . I go to school and now the teachers say I look sick or exhausted.  

I am so fucking tired of everyone's expectations, I'm tired of people calling me smart and brilliant when I don't feel like. I'm tired of being a failure, I really want my life to end . (Thanks if you took the time to read this, here's a cookie 🍪)"

at the same time, my mind is full of racing thoughts and anxiety. but also foggy. and dissociated. basically i’m either numb, crying from my intrusive ocd thoughts, or having a panic attack. so out of those three, i guess the boredom is the best option but fuck. 

it doesn’t matter if i’m at a music festival, on a beach in a foreign country, hanging out with my best friend, trying new hobbies. it doesn’t bring me joy. i only feel nothing or negative emotions, never any happiness. i’m just so exhausted inside and out, i have no energy whatsoever. sigh !!"

I recently had a really bad depressive episode that lasted around 3 weeks and ended maybe a week ish ago. This has happened a lot throughout 2021 where I would go weeks being depressed and then maybe a week or so of feeling completely fine. Right now I feel like I’m not in one of my depressive episodes and I almost feel like maybe I don’t need antidepressants BUT whenever I am in a depressive episode I always regret not getting medication. 

Now my question is - is it unsafe to take them when not feeling entirely depressed. I’m just so confused because a week ago I literally wanted to unalive myself and didn’t leave my room but now I literally am feeling ‘fine’. And am not sure if I’m being dramatic. But y’all I do this everytime I think it went away and then it comes crawling back anywayyyyyy I just don’t want to ruin my brain. 

Any help would be very appreciated ❤️"

I exprience Hot and Cold (others change thier attitudes so quickly, I don't know whats real or what's fake) and I feel Love and Pain. But the Pain overwhelms. The depression, the anxiety, the saddness, the ache, The Pain. It all crashes down like the waves. Overflowing, pushing and drowning. I'm floating in a sea of tears just waiting for the time to drown. Maybe I look forward to it. Maybe I know that it will end this suffering. Because I don't want to go on anymore. I don't want to try anymore. I just want it all to stop. To end. Maybe then I can finally find peace."

Passionateone96,2022-02-17 16:14:39+00:00,Feeling embarrassed,"I tried getting support on a support app because a teacher rolled her eyes at me when I tried explaining the reason I didn’t get a participation project done in my college class. I was just explaining to my teacher, I was not asking for more time. And the person said “In my opinion you are an adult and no matter your depression you have responsibilities. You weren’t explaining you where making excuses.” The way the person answered in a support group made me feel even worse. 

Some context: I work a full time job, am in full time college and I also have depression and anxiety. Which I am getting therapy for, the depression and anxiety is tied to childhood experiences."
whoiamidonotknow,2022-02-17 15:41:18+00:00,"SAD, and other covid/isolation-related factors: my [helpful!] regime","Writing this up in case future me is in need of help, and for anyone else out there. Also, please feel free to add in anything that's helped you! This has helped me immensely, but it isn't a magic bullet. That's okay. I'm working on it, and have become much more productive and happier in the meantime.

As with just about everything else, do everything you can to address as many factors as possible. I found myself getting progressively depressed after moving to a colder, less sunny climate and also the residual, ongoing effects from covid isolation and the lack of a stronger support system. This probably won't make anything completely 'better', but it'll likely help, at least a little bit, or maybe a lot--and that's worth pursuing. Here are some of the things I tried that've helped me:

* create a very well defined routine, and *adjust* it as needed. I made it by the half hour. Sometimes I follow it strictly, sometimes I don't. This shouldn't be a cause for shame if you're late or something takes longer than expected; it's to give yourself a sense of routine, purpose. It's to give yourself 'permission' to relax and train and go outside, and also to ensure that you get what you need to get done. Make sure to include:
   * wake up at the same time every single day. Don't look at screens or exercise for at least 2 hours before your intended bedtime. Schedule in enough time to sleep. Personally, I don't enforce going to bed at any time, and will let myself read/write/talk until I'm tired. Getting up at the same time every day means I'll be tired enough the next day to go to bed on time if I went to bed late for any reason.
   * develop some sort of morning and nightly routine. I find this really helps reset, calm, and help me look forward to the day (and sleeping).
   * training, at least 30 minutes of exercise. Make it something you enjoy. Extra points if you do it with other people or outside
   * going outside during daylight hours, however short or dim those may be
   * eating well. This might mean you meal prep for the week on the weekends so you don't need to cook daily
   * something social - this can be anything. Include time spent with friends if you have them; quality time with a partner if you have them; time spent socializing or 'seeing' other strangers; or even just time looking at human faces \[tv, movies is my last resort\] on a screen. Any volunteer opportunity can also be great. Whatever 'human' time you can glean during a pandemic, seize it.
   * gratitude (or affirmations, or journaling, or reading/workbooks/prompts if you're doing CBT with a therapist, or whatever works for you--something to help you reframe your thoughts, basically). You don't have to spend a lot of time on this--you can literally start with 30 seconds of just thinking through what you're grateful for. You can take 30 seconds, in bed, when waking up or before drifting off to sleep to visualize having a good/better/productive day, or what it'd be like if things went well. I personally take 3-5 minutes of writing through one of 5 gratitude prompts, and have found it surprisingly effective. The worse my mental state is, the more helpful it is!
   * meditation (personally, I thought I'd hate it--but I actually love it and find it quite useful!). There's a free resource with a group zoom meditation (unguided) of 15 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of talking/prompts, that happens every weekday hour, on the hour. This is also slightly social. I personally love it and try to time it for when I'm feeling particularly unfocused, depressed, or will use it when I've gotten completely off schedule. It's great for disrupting any 'unhelpful' thoughts or for helping me be able to focus when I can't. 
   * try to learn your own moods and body. How long can you spend working before your productivity drops? When do you work best? When do you physically feel best? Is your ability to focus (or depressive symptoms) worse at a certain time of the day, or after certain activities? If so, try to schedule and plan around it--and consider journaling to see if you can figure out if this is the case if not. If you have flexibility at work, use it--maybe that means you do 3-4 hours in the morning, then spend hours training and going outside in the sun, then another 3-4 hours in the afternoon. Think also about when you train best, what classes (if any) are available, etc. Don't get caught up in planning this out perfectly, though--throw down a quick draft of a schedule, try it for a while (even just the beginning of a day), then either keep or adjust it for the next day/weeks.
   * Implement a breakfast (with fat for absorption), vitamin D, sun lamp routine within 30 minutes of waking up. I put a couple cheap plants I had delivered with my groceries 'underneath' my sun lamp. If I'm really depressed, I might sip a more 'herbal'/holistic tea with my breakfast.
   * Therapy, as needed :) Even if your depression has solely physical causes, it can wreak havoc on your mind--or, of course, you might have some deeper root causes. Either way, if you can afford it, it'll likely only help and is worth trying.
* Adjust your environment.
   * All very optional, take or leave whatever works for you; these are just ideas that've helped me: Take a bath with epsom salts, essential oils every. Clean your house. Clean your air (ie vacuum radiators, sweep/clean, use air filters, add plants). Humidify your air during dry winters (easier to breathe, less dry/chapped lips/skin). Tidy up and remove clutter. Clean your sheets. Replace pillowcases frequently. Light a candle. Set things up (broad topic) to make it easier/more likely that you'll XYZ (eat better, meal prep, train, etc). Better health won't hurt, and might help, your mind. My environment absolutely reflects and is a result of any diminished mental states, but it's cyclical and can also influence my mood.
* Adjust your diet
   * Help your gut! You can take vitamins, but I personally love kefir (same price as milk, but delicious--can go into your smoothies, or you can make ice cream and cheese with it). I also have bone broth (isn't it amazing that you take stuff you'd throw away, add 10 seconds of 'work', and create something that both turns everything delicious *and* is good for you?!) that I use when cooking potatoes, curries, cooking pasta sauce, etc. Better gut health (adding both pro- and pre- biotics, enzymes) can help improve both mental and physical symptoms.
   * anti-inflammatories (food/tea/spice sources--some are fantastic at reducing inflammation, other things you eat may be adding to any sources of inflammation).
   * just very generally, a healthier diet. Eat the rainbow. Cook your own food. Learn to cook, and to enjoy it. Make it social if possible.
* Designate and differentiate where/when you'll work, think, feel different moods, etc.
   * You can use spaces, clothes, scents, or anything else you can think of. Nowadays I have a room for work, that has a candle used only in that room, with a different color scheme for it. I also have a room I train in, a space within that training room I read or do non-work stuff in (ie this right now, or goal mapping, or gratitude writing), a kitchen for eating, a space in the bedroom (otherwise reserved strictly for sleeping) for talking and feeling certain 'moods' and such. It's helpful to 'dress up for work' and transition into work by using a meditation session or going for a walk. At the beginning of the pandemic, I had a 1bd apartment, but designated the table, couch, and even literally sections of wall and yoga mats to certain frames of mind and activities. Again, do whatever is useful for you and helps you get into the appropriate frame of mind. 
* Investigate and work on any medical, physical causes
   * Work with your doctor. If you already have physical chronic illnesses, keep or start doing what you can to help manage them. Throw every lifestyle change into it that you have
   * Recognize that depression is not solely mental. They've shown depression can be induced via physical means (ie increased inflammation from physical disease, poor gut health). As is the case in many things of life, this can become cyclical: your physically ill, which causes you to become depressed, which in turn can cause your physical symptoms to worsen (both biologically and from a 'I'm too depressed to do XYZ that'd help my physical illnesses), which will hurt your mental health even more as your physical health deteriorates, ..... You also of course cannot get better-better on your own or through purely physical/environmental means if you're in need of healing via CBT, or deep trauma work, or whatever it is you're going through. And if you need medication, you simply need medication. All this stuff is a helpful factor to make things a little better; do not stop working on all the other things you need to do to get better!
* Keep, or start, seeking friends or activity partners. Don't give up if you don't have them!

Things to purchase (optional):

* sun lamp
* vitamin D/K vitamins (I hate pills, and know I won't reliably, consistently take them, so I buy these in the form of delicious chocolates)
* plants"

shoulderthesky,2022-02-16 22:21:09+00:00,when you seem to have your shit together but you actually don't,"i moved back to my hometown (which is also kind of a new country altogether since I went to college in another country), and I found a job after like a month of looking. I'm living with my uncle and aunt, and they've been so supportive, even driving over 800 km to get me and my dog when we arrived to the country (and accepting my dog in their home too, when they've never liked animals inside houses). I get up really early to workout before working my 8 to 5 job because that's the one thing that helps with my depression and anxiety, but lately it's been a real struggle. I thought I needed to go to bed early, so I've been doing that, but still everything I want to do is sleep. I also eat lots of vegetables, take natural supplements and vitamins, and make sure I have dessert when I'm craving something sweet, which has been often. I try to be gentle with myself, since I have a chronic illness besides my mental health issues that gets worse if I get stressed or don't take care of myself. My workouts always include yoga, and I do short 10 minutes meditations in the mornings, also before work. I'm honestly trying to do everything I can to be okay, yet I feel empty and stupid. 

I haven't been able to find a therapist here, and my last experience wasn't really great either (my psychologist dropped me because she felt I wasn't letting her do her job anymore). Since my therapist worked alongside my psychiatrist and she didn't refer me when they stopped seeing me, I decided to quit taking medication. I'm a doctor, so I did it carefully, and I feel like since they knew I wasn't going to off myself, they decided I didn't need a referral or to be taken seriously when I tried asking for a different approach to my therapy (CBT, new meds). I honestly don't have the energy to even keep looking for a therapist, and I'm not even sure I want therapy anymore, but I know my brain is not working properly. 

I think what kills me is... I can't talk about this with anyone. My family has never taken my mental health seriously, though they do worry more for me since I got sick three years ago. I have three friends, and though one of them is supportive when I need to vent, I feel like everything I do is vent and it's not fair to her. My other two friends don't really believe depression is a thing.

Michik0000,2022-02-16 17:51:16+00:00,few words,"It’s the 16 February of 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Time doesn’t seem to be a real thing anymore. Not sure of I want, or if I want anything at all.

I don’t want to seem dramatic. I know it’s pathetic and, although some people believe I am an extroverted and exaggerated person, the reality is that I just like play with that narrative often. It’s fun to care, to overreact over everything. To emphasize little actions - to give meaning to things. It’s entertaining. Maybe, it’s a coping mechanism? Not sure of that either.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, it feels like I am far away from that when I am alone. 

I wake up with the only intention to get the bare minimum done. To go over the list and tick all the boxes of all these micro-actions that seem necessary to give meaning to my career. Whatever that means. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I’m rarely getting anything done. My phone constantly receives emails from people demanding to send my work in. Yet, I avoid them, telling them that I am too busy. 

I know I am terrible, and I usually feel bad. But then, I think about how often they have mistreated me, and I feel less guilty about it. 

I tend to procrastinate a lot, watching things that have no meaning to me at all, yet, hoping that those minutes will make me feel a bit better. 

They never do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe masturbation will. But as soon as I do it, I feel terrible. I feel so bad that it has become one of the worst moments. The intensity of hatred towards myself is so strong that I want to bury me in it during those moments.

&amp;#x200B;

Work-wise, It seems like I’ve come to an end. 

I worked a lot for a few months, and people were constantly complimenting me, but I was genuinely stressing out. Is it because I am not used to working at all? Is it because I have always been maintained? 

&amp;#x200B;

I can’t help but hear opposite stories all the time. 

People told me to stop for a bit, to learn to say no to the jobs I didn’t want to do, to stop overworking myself. To refocus instead. They tell me I look and sound exhausted and that I should go out a bit more. 

And I remind myself that although I am happy to be working, I miss taking time for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then, there are all these other people. The ones that I have actually grown up with. My workaholic boyfriend or my parents, for example. The ones that are considered to be the most real. They don’t care about what other people say. They know you. They have coincided you. They have the right to say how they really feel about you.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad called me not that long time ago. 

It was one of the longest calls we had in a while and, he called me with a precise intention which is rare. 

He told me that he saw someone - like a Feng shui expert. 

Apparently, this year - the year of the tiger, will go terribly for me, and I had to be prepared for what I will be facing these upcoming months.

I responded, surprised - “worse than these past three years?”

Just as I thought to put all these shit years behind me, my dad gave me the biggest surprise. 

I mean, I actually don’t believe in these narratives at all. 

How could you describe an entire generation by the year they were born? It seems like total bullshit to me. 

My boyfriend consoled me and told me that I was lucky not to be the kind of person who believes in these stories. Imagine if I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

I agreed with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, one thing really stuck with me with this call.

My dad told me that my depression does not come from my experience. Instead, my sadness comes from me being a golden pig. Apparently, we’re simply so lazy that anything we are told does become a burden, trapping us in our own misery. 

&amp;#x200B;

Surprisingly, that’s exactly how I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

At times too overwhelmed, and the majority of the time, feeling underwhelmed by everything.

Not sure what to, nor what to feel. Just kind of sad having to live with false beliefs."

Obigroo,2022-02-16 05:16:41+00:00,My Story,I never thought I would be depressed ever in my life but you know it all starts with a girl... I was about 12 years old and I met her I literally couldn't stop thinking about her always exited to see her again and we found out we liked each other a little under a year later so we never because gf and bf but we liked each other so she stopped texting me gradually and I didn't think anything of it but little did I know it was eating away at me inside and time passed and she stopped texting and responding at all and that made me a little sad but then I found out she had turned bi and she flat out told me I don't like you anymore that's the first time my heart shattered about a year went by really sad . Sad music video games movies you know the who Sharad and then August 2021 parents got divorced did not help at all. I was taken away from everything I knew forced to live in an entirely knew environment and he started cutting myself and just wishing I was dead no one knew about any of this my mom found out I was suicidal and she didn't care at all same with everyone else no one cared about what was happening to. My mom didn't even tell me she was getting divorced until the day we left to stay at her friends house 300 miles away from my home stayed there about a month. And just recently she visited her friend and her other friend came over to stay with us at this point I sleep all day because it skips most of the sadness I experience throughout the day.And so I decided not stay up all night because my dog likes to bark at night and she was sleeping across from my room and I stayed up all night to make sure he didn't wake her up at this point I'm so tired I fall asleep and I wake up and hear her complaining about me to my sister the whole time saying stuff like I'm not just gonna say anything because I have nothing nice to say. And at soccer practice everytime I do something not perfect I get shamed for it. Literally I ow one cares about treating me right. The only thing keeping me alive is my girlfriend.

I don’t have any friends and frankly I could give a shit if people see me or not, but I think the most pain comes from having one person who you hope every single day with every ounce of your body will see that your not ok or at least show that they care, but they don’t. Sure it would be great for someone finally seeing that I’m in pain, but seeing that one true person I truly care about not see what’s really going on breaks me apart. I mean this person is the reason I’m still going and the only one who can genuinely make me laugh now a days, yet it feels like I’m still not enough and no one cares or could give a fuck about me. I just want one person to at least acknowledge that they are there for me, but I always end up alone. So, I’m either just a fabulous half assed actor or no one cares to really see the true emotions I am hiding, and it fucking sucks"

But I have been suicidal (suicidal thoughts atleast) for as far as I can remember. The only thing stopping me from self harm and/or s-attempt is the fear of anyone knowing it due to mental health stigma from where I live and failing to die if I ever attempted. (I had a plan laid-out already where I think it'll be quick and successful but I don't have the right equipment yet.) I have been feeling worse lately due to unemployment and being a burden to my family and society. 

The thing is....  I (23f) have a little bro (7m) and he accidentally saw my screen displaying ""I WANNA DIE"" in big, bold letters.  I have no idea how to handle this situation. I've never told anyone I know about me and really terrified of him knowing/understanding it because I love him to pieces. This happened last night and I talked about it being a joke and forget about what he saw then sidetracked the conversation by distracting him about other things.  He seemed okay today but I'm so ashamed I just wanna die even faster. IDK what to do.  

Asking for any advice about my brother? Will he be okay for a 7 year old? Sorry bad English. Not my first language."

And always a question, what should i do? Im just feeling like loosing it, i say to myself il be okay etc. But it just makes it worse.

People say that life itself is a gift, that when you live long enough it becomes obvious how valuable time on this earth is. I am convinced this is just a way to getpeople going until they get wrapped up in so many things they can't just let go. Life may be a gift, but it's a gift like rotting fish a cat gave you after trying to eat it and vommiting on it. I've seen landmarks, foreign lands and fields and mountains and the sea. And nothing is worth it. Nothing is worth continuing to be alive the way I feel now. 

I am weak. I am not strong because I am alive, I am just too lazy, burnt out and apathetic to actually get through effort of killing myself. I am also a coward, I am scared of the pain. I have a person I am basically living for and they are living for me, but I can't see a reason why. From what I know, they'd be better of dead and so I'd be. I am tired, so fucking tired, angry, hateful and bitter. I just wish I could delete myself in a way that I'd never exist."

For the past few years I’ve never been in anything serious because I don’t trust a soul and I’ve been happy as but always wanted someone who I could. 

The past 3 months was with someone and they were 100% honestly the best and first I ever been able to trust like so amazing but one day she lied to me about something to do with a lad and would hide the odd thing if her ex said anything looking back on it I genuinely think I was just not in the right headspace and was making stuff up in my head that wasn’t true. I’ve been so depressed about my past and all my regrets that I thought it was too good to be true that I fucked it all.

To the point I was just not being the same with her cause of this she became short with me and I thought even more she was up to something so I became even shorter with her Idk why thinking now I just didn’t believe I could trust. 

2 weeks went on and I barely replied ever saying anything to the point I pushed her away completely now even when I try to explain that I wasn’t with it doesn’t want to hear any of it because how I made her feel them weeks. And now why I was so paranoid and off the whole time has come to life, she is back with her ex or at him whatever. I recently posted a thread saying how was low, but now I acc don’t know how or what to do one person I had through it is gone because I pretended to be someone else. 

Please don’t tell me what to say to her either she’s gotten with her ex and Dk knows who else so please I just want to know or advice how to not feel like this I was on the edge of everything couldn’t take it bout to end and because my heads been so ducked and I’ve been so depressed lately I reflected it in my relationship and there no going back ."

I feel like my mind has been protecting me until recently when I realised these things that I mentioned above.

I don't have anymore friends now and the last friends I had I have told them to block me and move on as I feel like I'm not worth the trouble.

I probably won't have anymore friends ever again since I'm terrified of having the same thing happen over and over again. I feel like I really have to hide my depressed self these days due to how everything must be positive and ""good vibes"" so there goes telling anyone in the near future about my depression.

I always wonder how I would be today if I didn't get bullied into the ground during school. 

If you got this far reading my ramblings then I hope whatever you are going through, you come out of it. It's the least I can do."

Right now, I don't know what to do except for writing this or somehow ending my life. I'm a 24 years old male in Japan who is going to 2nd university(CS major) for me. Basically, I've been terrible at learning in school. At the age of 18, I was already thinking about how to die, cause it was clear that my only option was to have a terrible job and life. During I was in the 1st university, I got into programming and somehow managed to learn it enough to get a coding job interview or help my dad make his program(he is researching about sound in another Uni). Then I got the chance to convince my dad that I can go to a CS university and rebuild my life. Since then, all this 1st year in the Uni I've been fighting many problems, my allergy, my learning disabilities, being avoided by others cause of the age gap. There was a hope that if I get through this at all costs, I can finally be happy. Now after all that fighting, I'm having yet another critical issue(learning related). I'm asking myself, do I want to keep going not knowing when it's gonna be over? Wasn't it wise to end my life as soon as I realized I can't compete in society back when I was a teenager? Sorry, I just wanted to write my feelings since my parents don't listen to me and only tell me to try harder."

In a way where I ask myself: ""Why are you thinking your depressed? You have so much wonderful things in your life to be happy for."" But everything that I do have doesn't make me happier, if anything it just makes me think I don't deserve these valuable items that I have lost interest in anyway.

On days where I'm actually happy and motivated make me question even more about why I think I'm depressed in the first place. It makes me feel my thoughts are even more pointless and stupid. I think I have depression yet I have food, water, shelter, and clothing. Not to mention the crapton of electronics laying around everywhere.


It's at the point where I'm stuck in a cycle of depressive thoughts where I think I am actually depressed on one side, then another where everything seems fine leading me to over-think why I'm like this in the first place."

My life was truly a waste. And there was no reason for it. I was born into a terrible family, having poor social skills, physically ugly, not a lot of money and overall shitty location.

The truth is, people can say some bullshit like ""happiness comes from within"" but that's just fake. It's no different than telling us to ""be positive.""

Happiness comes from 4 things: 1. Where you live. 2. What you look like. 3. How much money/status you have. 4. A loving family/meaningful connections.

If you do not have those atleast somewhat, you won't be happy. You can spend all your time watching ted talks or paying for self help books, but this is it. Getting those gets you happiness.

For someone like me, I never got any of those. And honestly, as an adult, I don't think I ever will because of the state of the world and my own bad luck.

I'm not afraid to die. I'm bummed that I never got to live and now I might die in a war.

They've sabotaged so much growth and development. They've ruined my relationships with others. They envy me and I really look forward to the day when I am free from them if that day will ever arrive. It sucks that I have to even say this. The stress they've caused me has caused my relapse in drugs. So idc they can judge me however they want but first they need to take the damn log out of their own eyes to see just how many beatings I have taken. Then they can decide truly if their judgments are justified."
maskedmole69,2022-02-14 00:56:22+00:00,Depressed over something stupid.,"Over the past week or so, I've been terribly depressed and anxious.. I keep worrying I'm gonna get sued for thousands and thousands of dollars and have my home taken away and everything I own and then how am I possibly going to raise my family? Being sued for $10,000 dollars? Maybe I can handle that if I think of a plan. Being sued for 100,000 dollars or more and I will lose everything. Even 50,000.

I did something small but stupid. I screenshotted google earth street view pictures of trees I liked and posted them on a forum and now I can't delete them. I didn't worry at first because I mean everyone does it and just didn't think about it. Then began the ruminating thoughts... I looked up the legality of this. I am not allowed to do this according to google. So I tried deleting the posts but I cannot delete after a certain time. The delete button is permanently removed. I contacted support and no response. Sent moderator a message and no response from him either and it's been almost a month. 

On top of all of this, of course in the screenshots there were buildings and houses and like one person and cars in which important details like license plates and faces are blurred by google but it still worries me as I'm now in this gray area where yea it might be legal to show public images of people and houses and such but it doesn't prevent me from getting sued by random people or by google. 

Now I'm screwed because nobody cares about anyone except themselves and it may seem like a small problem to them but to me it is a catastrophe that messes with the sanctity of my mind and inner peace. The page has less than 300 views by the way. I also have a weather channel app I screenshotted and posted there showing my weather in this plant talking forum and now I am a bit worried about it whether I was actually allowed to do that either. 

I've just been more alert and worried about the internet lately as I guess growing older maybe my mind just thinks about consequences more. I'm 27. When I was younger I did more stupid things and didn't care nearly as much. This may seem small but to me it has ruined my peace of mind and feels like I'm stuck in a big hole with no way out. I think I've inherited my mom's worry gene as I've already inherited her shyness."

SamuelPauwels,2022-02-13 19:59:10+00:00,Pouring my heart out in english (dutch),"So, trying to pour my heart out on here, so when I was 17, my mom died of cancer (March 2017), I was living with here in Friesland, up north. Luckily for me, my dad was happy to take me in. On the downside, I had to move to a small village down south, meaning I had to leave everything, and everyone I knew. Combining this with dealing with the passing of my mom I felt like nothing mattered. Fast-forward to September 2017, I was able to start my last year of high-school, but because I didn't finish the schoolyard in which my mom died, I had to follow the up and coming year part time. Because of this, I had to find a job, and I found 1, working 3 days a week at my local supermarket. At first, I was kinda excited about meeting new people in my environment, and getting used to my new life here in Limburg. I graduated school in June 2018, but wasn't planning on going to college or university. I had no ambition of making something of myself. In the year I relocated myself to limburg I had made little to no friends. I get very nervous when I'm around people I don't know, I'm a very shy and introvert person, so I guess I have had myself to blame for making no friends. So, I continued working at my local supermarket until Feb 2019, when I started my next chapter in life. I starting learning to become a hyperbolic welder. I was always interested in working on a oil rig, and Fast-forward to June 2020 I graduated college. Afterwards I was looking for a job on an oil rig, with little luck. In my spare time I really enjoy gardening, so my dad had been in contact with close friends of his, and I started doing jobs for them. I had been feeling really lonely, demotivated and depressed during this time, because it was not at all what I expected my life to be, instead of making that next step in life, I felt like I was stuck being a total bum. I was seriously suffering from something but i didn't  know exactly what it was. Despite me being a round new people doing jobs for them I tend to be weak and cried eally often when I was alone and this is was really disheartening for me to see myself like this. The most shit part about this is that I felt like was letting my mom down, instead of making something of myself I was stuck in this endless hole of nothingness. During Christmas 2020 I finally had the courage to pour my heart out to my dad, I told him I felt depressed, and I wasn't happy with the way I was living my life. I felt as if I had lost myself and wouldn’t ever be the same again. I had no motivation to do anything because I couldn't see a future for myself. Anxiety caused me to believe everyone was faking their love for me. He told me to cheer up and bite through it. Of course he didn't know to respond to me, but Cheer up’ was the worst thing anyone said to me. Those two words triggered thousands of horrible thoughts and I was beating myself up for not hiding how I felt well enough from everyone around me.
I wanted everyone to know how I felt but I didn’t dare tell them. Eventually I just isolated myself in my room because no contact with people meant nothing could go wrong, surely? So in march 2021 I found an application as a hyperbolic welder on an oil rig just of the coast of Ijmuiden. I qualified for the job and felt invincible, I finally found something that I wanted to do. So when you work on an oil rig you're offshore 2 weeks, and home 2 weeks during a season (6 months, the other 6 months you're home). At first it was fine, getting to meet new people, adjusting life, I got my own apartment in Ijmuiden (out west of nl), and being independent. But then October 2021 hit. The rig season was over and I was home in Ijmuiden, away from my dad. Covid cases hit a new high, and a lockdown was announced in November. During this time I felt very lonely, and couldn't go to my dad, because the travel distance was too exhausting for us. I didn't want to relocate to Limburg (south) because I found it a waste of money to not be living in my apartment and because there is a long waiting list and shortage on houses here, I'm very scared of losing this place. I feel like I'm lonely and  I don't know if I need a psychologist to talk to, I've always been very shy and introvert and feel like talking to 1 would make me feel weak and defeated."

Housed: San Quentin State Prison

I have discovered that there is no simple answer to the question “What is prison like?” or “Why I became addicted to drugs.” I used to feel haunted by such questions. I could not format a valid and truthful response. Yet, during this prison term I experienced two things which the California Department of Corrections had deprived me of during previous terms. The ability to learn about myself through self help groups, and the chance to learn through the on-sight college program. 
What Is Prison Like? 
 
Returning to the streets – faces, souls, and spirits I meet. 
Curiosity beating down the like, what is prison like? 
 
Prison is like being in a time vacuum where life has ceased. 
Neither moving forward or backward, alive but deceased. 
 
Prison is like a sack into which each day, each hour, drops another stone.  
Bending the spine until the tell-tale crack. 
 
Prison is like being at the bottom of a well, walking round and round. 
Without physical or material existence – incorporeal. 
 
Still, prison is not like hell, neither like heaven. 
Not all gloom and depression. 
See and you shall find the nadir of oppression."

I am writing this in regards to what’s going on here at Pocahontas State Correctional Center in Virginia and I here is indicative of prisons across the US. We are on modified lockdown due to staff bringing in Covid-19 again. We are supposed to be separated- top tier, bottom tier- but they make us walk to the chow hall together, go outside together and let each tier mingle with the next. They let inmates handle and pass out face masks. Unfortunately, half the staff doesn’t wear face masks and they threaten us with charges if we don’t have ours on. They are steadily conducting cell searches walking into a two-man cell with two and three staff members at a time. They they proceed the next cell without changing their gloves. Protocol instructs them to bring our trays to us since a pod in our building has positive cases, but we are made us walk to the chow hall. Apparently, it saves them money because not everyone walks to get food. Yet, if they have to bring the trays to us then they have to prepare a tray for everyone in the pod. In building A pod they have positive cases and staff steadily go in and out, directly into the next pods. They are often not wearing a face mask and never wearing gloves. potentially spreading the virus. Yesterday between 9:45 AM and 10:00 AM in A.3 pod the assistant warden was walking around the pod not wearing a face mask. On 1.20.22 between 8 and 8:30AM staff conducted Covid tests to the pod without changing their gloves after handling each test. The staff here has zero regard for our health and safety. They openly make remarks about the virus not being serious and tell us we are crazy for getting an experimental vaccine. There have been so many complaints lodged against this place over the years, but it seems like it always gets swept under the rug and nothing ever happens. I would like to get this out there for everyone to know what goes on in here. I would like my name to stay anonymous when it comes to this place because retaliation is a real thing here with staff. Thank you for your time and patience.

I had worked hard to find bandmates, I finally had a band that cared, and things were going well, we had just released our debut EP! I had a girlfriend, we were good. I had been working with my grandparents as a sorta job. But then we find out my band's guitarist has been harassing a lot of girls, so we have to kick him out, and then the drummer wants to take a break, so I don't have a band anymore. I realized that my feelings for my (now ex) gf are just platonic, so now our mutual friend group hates me. My grandma passed away, which really sucks. And now I can't find a job, so I won't be able to afford a car, so I won't be able to have a band in college.

No matter what I do, everything falls apart and what's the point of trying when nothing ever works out for me? I might as well just give up."

Big choices, like what to do with my life, what college I go to, what I major in, are almost impossible. Even if I made a choice, it would be nearly meaningless. 

I have no idea what I'm going to do. I don't know if I'm going to college. If I find a college, I don't know what I'll study. If I find out what I want to study, I don't know what job I'll get. If I get a job, will I keep it? Should I? 

There's a constant cycle of questions in my head. I keep asking myself why. Why I'm alive, why I'm like this, why anyone cares, why I don't. I feel like I'm the only one who cares and also like everyone cares too much. I am the only person who can help me and I can't even do that."

Now the issue is that I hate to have time off from doing those things. Every time I hang out with my GF or want to watch a movie I feel like I am wasting my time. I know it's good to have time off but I keep feeling guilt when I do.

Any advice?"

So I recently broke my leg while playing football while drunk with some of my homeboys and that was a few weeks ago. Luckily it was a clean break so they just put me in this splint then my next appointment they put me in a cast up to my thigh and sent me home n while I was laid up in bed my sister sends me a picture of my girl making out with some guy I’ve never seen outside a starbucks. So when she gets home I showed her n she immediately started flipping out on me n stormed out so I ended things n she took her stuff out my place but not after cursing me out. And do a few of my pals said they’d take me out for a night to clear my mind n I didn’t want to go at first because I didn’t want to be that guy in the club in a wheelchair but they convinced me n i went with them and it was fun at first a few girls were dancing on me n one of em took a shot from in between my toes that stuck out the cast lol. But then after awhile we decided to get some food so we left n were in the parking lot for a lil deciding what to get when they chose a McDonald’s across the street n they went n I said I’ll stay behind in the parking lot by the car cause I wanted to smoke so they went n after a few minutes about 4 random dudes i don’t know walked up stood around me n one guy just started saying that’s the guy that was dancing with Jaz. And I guess  that’s one of the girls who was dancing on me earlier that night n he another dude stepped up n said yeah that wheelchair guy n then after a few seconds this tall guy with dreads said oh yeah nobody dances with my girl I don’t give af who it is. N they all started punching me n then stripped n robbed me. I woke up in a hospital bed again and now I’m so depressed n angry like why can’t anything go my way just for once. Now I’m laid up with even more injuries before and my girl cheated n Is gone and the police still haven’t identified anyone or found any leads on who might’ve done it."

The guy (25/m, diagnosed with anxiety) who broke up with me in Nov after a week of being together cos he couldn’t commit to me because of his mental health according to him, came back around in January, flirted with me again. He said he didn’t want a label but I told him I can’t allow that and it’s either he’s in or out. So he chose not to commit again for the same reason. I cut all communication with him straight away. I wrote about how he dropped the ball again and that he’s not ready to commit because he’s scared of what he’ll miss out on in a blog. He found it and said what I wrote was vile and offensive, said I hope I get the help I need and he blocked me everywhere.

I’m stuck in a rut in my head confused. I initially thought he just wanted to shift blame and rid himself of guilt. But why am I the bad person now? I’m starting to believe it now and I hate it. I hate him. It’s like my mind is on a loop. 

I’ve deleted all posts related to him on my blog. He still visited my blog last night (I get notifications when somebody visits it)."

I straight up can't tell them the truth. I'm a cold person and my friend said how what I suggested was cold and mean and asked me who broke my heart. Funny enough I said ""everyone"" and in response to that he said ""you must be very fragile or have a fragile heart"" 

I f*cking hate that. I am not fragile! I just don't open myself up to get hurt. Idk I feel like I'm slowly losing my friends. My depression got a little bit better after socializing with ppl but it's gotten 100 times worst lately. Idk if they are really friends or just ppl I know. I fucking hate it.

MarioMan1213245765,2022-02-12 05:34:39+00:00,Should I talk to my therapist?,"Hello. I’m a 21 year old male with ADD, don’t know if that matters but but I’ve been kind of struggling with some things for a while, and a couple people have wanted me to talk to my therapist about the possibility of me having depression, though I’ve never really thought I had it. But…in the last couple days I have been noticing some things. Let me go over them all.

1. I don’t really care about taking care of myself. For example, I barely brush my teeth in the last few years, though I have been trying to do better lately. 

2. I don’t really care about school all that much. I’ve had a rough few semesters in a row, and this one is already shaping up to be just as bad. It’s hard to get me to be motivated to study, but I’ve always taken that as a laziness thing. But the fact is I legit am not sure I give a damn about it.

3. I’ve found it hard to be empathetic at times. For example, one of my friends has a lot of things going on, she always talks about her issues, but the fact is, I don’t care. To be fair, she and I have a really strained friendship though. But sometimes I feel the same way when my girlfriend has a bad day and talks about it, or maybe it could be intrusive thoughts. Either way that scares me. I’ve also had a couple deaths in the family the last couple years, and while I was of course upset, I didn’t always feel as upset as I thought I should. These are just a few examples.

3. I have a history of self harm. Ok I know this one would probably make anyone instantly tell me it was depression, but here’s why I’m not so sure about this one: I was seeking attention most of the time I did it. And I’m very ashamed of that of course, but it was a rough year, it was near the end of my senior year of high school, I wasn’t sure if I was going to graduate, I did some stupid shit. There’s only one time that I feel was genuine self harm, and it was in 2020 in lockdown, things were tense with the pandemic and my family and I at each other’s throats what with our cabin fever of sorts. Anyway, I never cut deep very deep. I always used disposable plastic knives because i was worried a metal knife would have bacteria on it and I would get an infection(I’m a hypochondriac, I know how ridiculous this part sounds) and just made scratches. They started out light, but soon got deeper and deeper until I actually would leave marks, occasionally bleeding. I still have some scars. I do want to say, I have not done this since the summer of 2020, though there have been times I was tempted.

4. I’ve had suicidal thoughts. I know this seems like another hardcore red flag that would make anyone say it was definitely depression, but here’s the thing. I’ve never actually felt like they were real. I don’t feel I was ever going to act upon them. Though there were a couple times I was planning it. During the start of the pandemic I thought a lot about driving as far away from everyone as I could until I ran out of gas, pulling over and slitting my wrists, or another time I was legit planning to after my grandma died. I wrote out a note, I went to buy some rope…but I just couldn’t. I still don’t know if I was actually going to do it, or if I was just being childish. I feel like I am being childish with a lot of these thoughts. The fact is though, I’m scared of death. Yet sometimes I just wanna die. 

5. I’ve had urges to isolate. When I didn’t end up hanging myself, I tried to leave my friend group, thinking they didn’t want me and were better off without me. I didn’t end up staying out for very long. I tried again a month later but that didn’t last long either. I still feel like that was childish. Another one though, last year after I had an especially rough semester of college, I kinda gave up. I felt that my life was heading towards nowhere, and that I was no one, just an immature 21 year old who would never get better, and I wanted to run away and live homeless on the streets since I felt that was where I was headed and drink myself to death. It obviously didn’t end up happening but I seriously wanted to and planned to. 

6. The sadness feels comfortable sometimes. It’s weird, but I often feel like I’d rather be sad than happy. 

7. I still feel happy often, like when I’m with friends or my girlfriend, or watching a movie or show or playing a video game. Tbh this is wet I’ve never been sure it was depression. But I tend to throw myself into my hobbies and nothing else, if that changes anything.

So yeah. That about sums it up. Could this be depression? Should I talk to my therapist? Any advice would be appreciated."
Hookahfinch,2022-02-12 03:29:42+00:00,My mental health is getting worse and worse,Always had depression. Lately its just gotten out of control. I've been feeling so much anguish that its causing physical symptoms. Everything hurts. It's led to me desperately reaching for any sort of relief even if its bad. So many bad coping mechanisms. I try and try and try. I've been having dangerous thoughts and feel on the verge of giving up completely. I think writing my feelings on here is the only bit of positive coping I have. I feel momentary relief being able to type it out.

I feel like so few people actually know me because I'm always trying to be the ideal version of me instead of me. I've been like this for so long that unlearning these behaviors seems next to impossible, but I can't keep going like this.

This started around 2 years ago. I guess I’m just going through the “growing up” part of my life. I know that most teens goes through this, and deals with it way better than me, but this is atleast how I feel about it. It feels like a endless loop of stress, loneliness and depression swarming around me constantly. Happiness is not really something I experience a lot, but when I do, it is a really short taste. 
I feel like I could just end it anytime. I feel numb, like I could not give less of a shit about anything around me, or myself. But some little part of me doesn’t want to, and I guess that’s a good thing. 
I miss the times where I had no clue about anything, where I had fun all the time, not stressing one bit, not feeling depressed, and the time the only reason I cried was because I was physically hurt. 

How do you deal with it?"

I feel a little loopy. Like im just so tired of feeling bipolar (not literally bipolar, just a figure of speech as in, too many ups and downs). Its like hahaha, another night at 2am where im sad as dirt for no reason? The people who were shit in my life ive distanced myself from, they can't hurt me anymore. I've got a new job and im making strides in my career. I have people who love and care for me. Yet I go to sleep and its like my brain melts, im consumed with loneliness and the feeling that no amount of happiness will ever be enough. Nothing I do will be enough to quell this. Im on meds, therapy round 2 is planned and will commence soon... I hate this. During the day im relatively fine, but once it comes time to sleep, I fall apart."
Prestigious_Draft_24,2022-02-11 07:57:39+00:00,"After years of avoiding friendship, I finally feel lonely",I never truly valued people due to my depression. I had so many friends in highschool that I just ended up neglecting and I became a bad friend because I felt really misunderstood. They weren't great friends either but nonetheless I didn't feel any loneliness at the time because I was so young. Now and days I find myself feeling increasingly lonely and mourning friendships that weren't even that great. I miss talking to people and being able to laugh and have fun even in a shallow way. I find myself being annoyingly friendly to random people and I feel embarrassed when they pull away. I guess I'm just fed up being alone with my own thoughts.

Progress idk, but this isn’t why I’m here. I think I’m letting my dad down a little bit. A earlier I asked him how hard was it to date for him, he sympathized with me because he was in the same situation that I’m in currently. After asking him I found a post from him on a Facebook group we’re in. While slightly embarrassing a lot of the feed back was helpful and provided some insight I could use, albeit a lot of the comments were the standard “just make a compliment” or “just wait”. Now I recently found another post on another group from him commenting on a thread of “what skills are you passing to your sons”. His comment was along the lines of looking for a challenge and going for self improvement. This is where my situation is, I haven’t gone for either of those and it makes me feel bad. I just keep spiraling and fixating on weither or not I’m I letting him down. He hasn’t talked to me about this sort of thing and I want to make him proud but I don’t think I’ll be able to anytime soon. I want to make him proud more than anything"

The few times I have gotten the motivation to answer the phone and talked to her, she made it clear she was in and out of hospitals and was struggling doing simple home chores let alone breath, she’s just really sick in general.

I love her to death, and I wish I could be there for her.. but I’m so depressed.

“Cry For Help”

Deaths due to drug overdose have reached an all time high in America and there doesn’t seem to be any brakes on the runaway train. This is the reality we face in 2022, but the lost and forgotten in prisons across America deal with the same struggle. The difference? We’re property of the Illinois Department of Corrections. The cells we live in should be condemned! Cockroaches nest in the walls. The water we are forced to drink causes illnesses. IDOC says, “Nothing is wrong with the drinking water,” however staff and outside visitors are told NOT TO DRINK THE WATER. We need water to survive, but the commissary has not sold bottled water in 4 months. Dayrooms and yard times are denied due to short staffing. Just stay in your cells and dwell on Covid-19. Do not ask for help or complain. Stateville doesn’t care. Christmas 2020 we weren’t allowed in person visits – the vaccines had not yet been distributed. Christmas 2021, Stateville goes on a “Medical Lockdown,” due to officers testing positive. No visits from my 73 year old parents. December 24th, I’m watching the Wizarding and escaping into childhood memories of Harry Potter. Stateville, supposedly “Short Staffed” due to another covid outbreak, somehow has the officers to do cell shakedowns on Christmas Eve. I do my best to go along, not make waves, but I COULD NOT COMPREHEND why I was being pulled out of my cell at this time. As a man of faith I’m supposed to turn the other cheek, but what happens when you run out of cheeks? Taking “medicine” along with blood pressure pills was my remedy that night. Under the Covid-19 quarantine, I've tattooed myself from head to toe, been to segregation twice, and had debilitating depression and anxiety. Prison itself brings about isolation. COVID cut off all in person contact with the outside world. The lack of humanity and personal connection has been crippling for me. Will you help me keep my sanity in an institution that views me as nothing more than a product on a shelf that will expire and simply be thrown out? Will you step into my pain? Acknowledge my humanity and tell me that it’ll be ok?"

It seem I have no where to go anymore, I live in a toxic environment and don't have the money to move out. I have occasional suicidal thoughts but never entertained the thought until last week.

seriousotter,2022-02-10 10:55:55+00:00,I'm scared,"I've become scared of my depressive episodes. My episodes have become so severe that I'm scared that one day I don't have the strength to fight myself and I end up killing myself and hurting my family by doing that. 

I never even imagined that I could actually be scared of having my depressive episodes. I've been having them for 8 years and they don't last long so that's why I call them episodes. But never the less they are horrendous and I don't want to feel that excruciating pain that I feel when having one. I can cope with the continues pain in everyday life but not when it's soul crushing like in a episode. So now I've become scared of them and I've started to have panic attacks because of that. 
I don't know what to do anymore. I just don't want to keep living like this. 

Anyone got advice on how to keep going?"

I'm suicidal but not actively planning to end it I've just kind of stopped living and taking care of myself amd comsider ending it everytime anything small slightly inconveniences me or triggers me. It's hard to have empathy for anyone around me in this mindset because I just feel kind of stuck and dead and dissacotiated so when I need to help others I have to kind of put up an act. I'm exhausted and considering going mia from everyone for awhile just jc it feels like an alternative to dying. Disapearing or something idk. I really don't have any hope or will do do anything anymore. I'm just done trying to survive because I'm exhausted.
CrypticEthos,2022-02-10 02:50:08+00:00,I figured I'd share something I wrote about my current mental state,"I wanted to die because the texts I sent are no longer left on read
The life we lived is no longer the one I see
Screams no longer echo throughout my mind
Your disdain no longer perplexes


I wanted to die because now I see you sad
Now the emotions you hid away show their ugly face
Screams no longer echo throughout my mind
The only fear I feel is of never ending loneliness 


I just wanted to die when you said I’ve changed
So many times you screamed my name
How many times have I comforted the wrong way 
Did I show my affection too many times
How many times must I say please do not yell


I wanted to die because everything I did was a lie
You say I lied to you
You say I used you
Through the many sleepless nights wondering what I’ve done wrong
The days without a text, saying to leave you alone
Apologies for trying to love
No wonder I always felt so alone
No wonder I wanted to die
Now it’s all over, the relationship sealed away behind those 7 letters
You blocked me because you loved me
Or so you’ve said
You acknowledged your wrong doings 
So why do I feel so wrong
Five months lacking love and respect
Enough screams to fuel my nightmares for years
So many pointless I’m sorrys to sooth your rage
So why do I feel so wrong


I wanted to die because the texts I sent are no longer received 
The nights I’d cry to sleep wondering why my love wasn’t enough
Why you’d push away as you did
Why I had felt so wrong for loving wholeheartedly 
Now awash as I re-read your endless pleas to block you
Because all I did was hurt you
Was I really so bad


I want to die because I don’t know what's reality
I don’t know if my version of reality is real
Am I just a twisted fuck who twists it to his own accord"

Kster76,2022-02-09 20:28:13+00:00,I saw what it was like to be happy and now I am lost,I have been depressed for most of my life I remember having suicidal thoughts and just generally having a lower quality of life in middle school. Now I am in college and I feel worse than ever and its all because I felt what it was like to be happy. I was in a 2 year long relationship with a girl who randomly joined my discord server. I had never seriously tried dating before that but I had always assumed that it wouldn't be worth it because I would just bring my partner down. Before this relationship I always felt like I was depressed due to thoughts I would have and how I always was sad like 3/10 and could only really reach 5/10 happiness. There was one time in my life where I truly felt like 1/10 permanently no matter what I did. Being with this person immediately made me feel like a 4/10 and even though I was still sad I was actually able to reach 7 or 8s and I realized what it was like to be happy. We broke up a few months ago and I think I forgot what it was like being alone. I am once again stuck in a permanent 3/10 rarely reaching 4 or 5. Even though its more then likely the same and isn't the worst I have ever been knowing what it was like to be happy makes it so much worse. I am constantly torn between hating myself for finding out what its like to be happy to being grateful for it. I am so lost and alone now. Thanks for reading this sorry for the weird scale I am sure everyone has there own unique way of rating there sadness but for me its a weird out of 10 scale.
Puzzleheaded_Dot5975,2022-02-09 19:57:34+00:00,I don't know how to express it,"Possibly a wall of text incoming,

Idk how to start this so I guess I will just list things as they come to mind writing this

I am an 18 y/o male especially recently I am always tired during the day no matter how much I sleep. I don't enjoy anything anymore or at least not for longer than maybe a very short burst. I don't know if I am just lazy and looking for excuses writing this or whatever. I was about to try and basically list the key moments that have brought me here but that list was already getting too long so I am mainly going to focus on my feelings as that is already hard enough. I will cut this part short but my apprenticeship which I always wanted to do and started at the age of16 ( software developer) is not going well at all I am not happy with my progress final exam is in 3 months( I will probably still pass it but I am not confident in my general ability) partly going bad because of my own fault and part of it external factors such as home office since march 2020 I just want to be good at it to make my parents happy and proud but I have lost all my motivation for pretty much anything my emotions are dull or numb for example I recently wanted to comfort my mother after my grandmother passed away but I couldn't find any words and just sat there not feeling anything myself and not finding any words to help. As I am writing all this I am starting to see myself that maybe I really should take my issues serious and not play them down and hate myself for being lazy I am just torn apart between these possibilities. Am I just lazy or actually in need of help.

Gonna give a short paragraph of my childhood as that may help you understand my situation I also have an essential tremor so I was  always bad at anything involving craftsmanship or just working with your hands basically aswell as my muscles not being developed as they should be I was and still am for the lack of a better way of describing it physically hindered in some tasks ( not in a drastic way for example I was always the worst in sports  I am just weaker in muscle strength than others)so I probably had low self confidence to begin with then I also had the struggle of bad teachers which I didn't resonate with they would do things like make you calculate on the blackboard in front of the class which for most children would maybe be fine but if u already were struggling with a low sense of self worth it didn't help things. 

I am noticing that symptoms such as ""bad thoughts"" are getting worse and it kind of feels like I need to make a decision or else it may spiral down even further without stopping I may already have commited some form of self-harm for years I just never perceived it as that untill recently where it was getting more frequent again nothing life threatening but most likely permanent (cosmetic)damage has been done.


Idk what I expect from this post but currently I am looking for the right words to ask for help without being a burden to the people around me."

Depressed-Head766,2022-02-09 18:47:46+00:00,How to survive as a depressed person?,I was really depressed for over 2 years after a bad breakup that ended up getting me fired from an organisation in 2019 . I signed up for therapy after a suicide attempt and continued for about 6 months but my family started hinting  like it's expensive and medicines are not good even though I was still feeling bad. I stopped the treatment because I thought my family couldn't afford it. I spent another year unable to do anything engaging in harmful coping mechanism without anyone knowing. Now I'm finally just trying to get up but I have a two year gap on my resume that I can't explain. What do I do? How do depressed people survive? Why do depressed people who are already fucking suffering have everything against them?

Bulky-Definition-955,2022-02-09 11:04:23+00:00,help,"I have been so depressed since i was around 12/13. My parents were really strict and me and my mum never really got along  so i never got to play out with my friends growing up, i never had a childhood that everyone had. i was just stuck studying. my mum uses to even take my phone off me when i got in the house after school, so i couldnt speak to anyone . my parents were very controlling growing up. i told my mum i was suicidal and she cried because she doesnt understand why i would even say, since then i never ever opened up to anyone about my family life because if my mum doesnt care then who else will. fast forward to now, i am nearly 25 and my mental health is worse than ever, i never really got over my childhood experiences and often notice myself thinking out it and it makes me sad for the rest of the day. somedays everything is going well but i still feel so sad , i dont understand why, i try to shake it off but nothing works. sounds weird but i feel like i went through a grieving process as i had to come to a realisation that i will never have the mum i always wanted. one who would care about my feelings, support me , wouldnt constantly judge me and trust me to go out with my friends. it was so sad growing up watching friends put up photos of day outs and birthday meal and  i was never there. when i did go out, they will be calling and threatening me to come home asap if it was like past 6pm and how they will never trust me again. bare in mind i was 13+ at this point. this went on till i moved out at 19. i felt like i had to do this to move on. i also suffer from a lot of symptoms growing up. i have big fluctuation with my mood swings and i always tried to get to the bottom of this. is this due to mine and my mums relationship and was it to do with me. I have a problem focusing on task , it only takes one small distraction to loss interest. i put off task for hours , days , weeks or even months and do them last min because of the anxiety of actually doing it. I have trouble listening to people aswell. even when i am staring right at them i cant hear anything. its not me being rude but the words get mixed up in my brain. i have trouble letting people finish a sentence , if i have a answer i just cant hold them in , i have to say it out loud straight away and many more . having a look at the symptoms i had suspected that ADHD in women might be something i need to speak to my doctor about. However i cant find the strength to pick up the phone and call them. waking up every morning is a chore , i really dont want to do it anymore. how can i speak to my doctor ???? i really dont want to be living like this anymore."

jegelskerdanskernes,2022-02-09 09:48:30+00:00,i don’t know what to do,"i’ve struggled with mental illness for my entire life. when i was 17 i started getting help, seeing a psychologist and taking meds. everything just started slowly getting worse, and now in the last year or so it’s been so overwhelmingly awful and i can’t seem to do anything about. i can barely afford to see my psychologist monthly, and i can’t afford to see a psychiatrist, even with Medicare rebate. i got a referral but the price is too much. i want to kill myself, i’ve tried a few times before and i have a plan that i can take action on at almost any time. i can’t keep being alive like this, but i can’t see a better future for myself. i know that it’s only going to get worse and i honestly have no clue what i can do to get better or learn to cope. i have no family support and no friends i can talk to. if anyone has any advice that’d be amazing. i can’t live this way anymore."
Asian_Sauce,2022-02-09 08:54:14+00:00,I have no friends,"Does anyone else have no friends in college?

So i’m currently a freshman in college with no friends whatsoever. And no, this is not an exaggeration. When i say i have no friends i really don’t have a single friend. Sure, i have a couple people i talk to in class but it’s not going anywhere, there people you usually talk to in class that sit close to you so it’s not awkward the semester. My day consists of waking up, going to class, coming back to my apartment, studying, and going to sleep. I also live alone which can be hard sometimes. Sometimes it just gets so damn lonely. I literally lose my voice when my parents come over for a weekend because I’m not used to talking anymore. 

I use to have a lot of friends in high school. I was the talkative and outgoing type who just talked to any and everybody. I had friends from different types of school and etc. Since I came to college I’ve just lost my social spirit that makes me who i am. Now i find it hard to talk to people and before talking to people was what have me energy! I did come to university with my child hood best friend, but he showed his true colors when we got here. He joined a frat and just brushed me off like i was nothing. If i’m being honest it did hurt a lot knowing somebody I had so close just ditched me when he had the chance. But i’m over it now so it’s not a big deal, i’m just venting ig lmao. 

I just find myself depressed all the time now and i don’t know why. I feel so empty now and i feel like i’ll never make friends who are really friends again. I mean i figured it’s gonna be impossible to have friends when i join the work force. Is this just how life is and i have to get used to it? 

TLDR - I don’t have friends and I sad"

I don’t want to off myself, not right now… (I have in the past, I know what that feels like.), but I literally feel so numb. I’ve never felt like this. I just stay home and cry until I have to work. I’m only working part time right now, so I’ll basically cry until like 30 minutes before I have to leave and then I’ll shower and get myself together for like 5 hours then come back home and immediately go back to bed. Like the numbness is that I can’t even tell you why I’m crying. I just know I’m losing it. Spiraling. I’m scared of it getting worse. I don’t want to be suicidal again. I just want to run away from everyone and everything. I have no one. I’m living with my mom right now. Just moved back home. I tried to kind of tell her how I feel. She told me that I’m just always so dramatic…. Then I told her that she clearly doesn’t understand, and that I know it’s hard to hear, but something is wrong with me. She then started screaming and crying and telling me that I can’t do this to her…. That if I really feel like that she’s taking me somewhere to check me in this weekend. 


I don’t want that. I just need someone to listen. Besides a therapist. I feel like people just tolerate me. I have goals and dreams that I’ve never even attempted to touch. I just feel worthless and that I don’t deserve anything. 

I have no one. My friends are all married and moved. It’s like my entire life so far has been happening, but I’m in a clear box…. Just watching everything take place, but I can’t move anywhere. I’m stuck. Like I’ve been present things, but the memories I have are just picture that I don’t remember taking.

I've been dealing with disordered eating for a year now, I think cause of the depression. People have noticed but never done anything. I was talking to this dude and he seemed chill and actually seemed to care but he's been ghosting me lately. I honestly feel like I've fucked everything up. I piss my family off the first thing in the morning, by going to school. School isn't even fun anymore, ppl just talk to me for answers and thr friends I have don't really talk to me anymore. I understand why tho, the last month has gotten worst for me and I opened up to them about it. I'm just a fuck up. I can't do shit correct. I can't even get help.

We lived, we laughed, we loved, we cried, we figured things out. We loved each other unconditionally. We experienced life to the fullest with each other. This is the first human i've been with that actually cared about me. I asked the universe to fill a gap in my heart and it gave me her. She was everything i've ever wanted.  But all good things come to an end. She is an international student. She has to leave in a year and go home unless she chooses to stay in the states. Everything was so good until last night. She said we wouldn't be able to work out because of this. We both understand but don't want to, we  spent the night crying and telling each other how much we love each other. I just wish love didn't hurt this bad. I wish it could be different. I told her I would wait for her and I will. I love her so much. I've learned that the right people and the wrong time are a very real thing. I don't know why im on reddit it just feels good to type this down because I have no one to talk to. I just ask can you guys send me good vibes we are both scared and want this to work. I pray it all works out. I'll hold onto her as long as I need to. I just hope she has a change of mind and wants to give this relationship a chance. I just want to see her happy. The pain hurts."

Words pierce like knives, I feel like I'm doomed to be alone and hated because I'm an awful shitty human being. I try my hardest to be a good person and i always go out of my way to make people happy but I still feel like I'm a failure. I still feel awful. Do i even deserve to be called human? I'm less than human. I'm a walking disaster who just drowns myself with unhealthy coping mechanisms paranoid that I'm worthless and everyone hates me. What's wrong with me?"

on top of an overly toxic family, undiagnosed depression, an eating disorder, dropping out of school and not being able to comfortably go to any public places due to crippling anxiety, loneliness, and a hateful neighbor, said hateful neighbor just anonymously called animal control, and lied to them about us letting dogs run into their yard.

until last week i had nothing to live for. we found a dog on the side of the road and took him in, he was emaciated and didn’t have a collar. i’ve been taking care of him, making sure he behaves, and now he’s gonna get taken so soon purely because our neighbor hates us."

He said that I join conversations by attacking people. He said he was being blunt because he didnt feel like using subtle jabs to get the message across. This devasated me. This was months ago. A vast majority of my friends agreed he was way out of line for saying that stuff and its not true. But i cant get it out of my head. Its like he tore out a piece of me. I got so mad at him I exploded, told him he sucks and we cant be friends. He told me that was a low thing to end a long term friendship over. Last thing he said to me was fuck off, after i said his apology wasnt genuine. I still hear about him, and its like the ghost of his presence haunts me. I have felt so suicidal since this event. I dont want to kill myself, but I want to escape the agony i feel each night. Part of me wants to talk to him, though I know thats a terrible idea. I hate him! He was so nice to me, for so long. We helped each other out through thick and thin and I loved him like a brother. Though over time he changed and found me too annoying. He lashed out at me, and now even after months I am still effected by his words. I am pathetic and want to move on. I hate him and myself. Fuck his ass, he knows im so pathetically sad and still said im an insecure bitch. Who says that to THEIR SUICIDAL FRIEND?! what did he even want from me?! Sais he thought id ignore him for a week and then agree with him. How fucked is that? Why do I still care?"

I've tried to find help. But there aren't any good available psychologists where I live, and even if there were they wouldn't take my insurance

 No one can live my life but me, all my life I've had to propell myself, my parents though kind have largely been absent. They see me sleeping all day, wasting my life, abd hear my struggling but do nothing, I guess it's not their job. I won't blame them.

 My upbringing was rough, sexual ab*se, bullying, threats of violence. These all probably shaped my psych, but what am I to do with them now?

 I've missed out on some great opportunities like serving my nation, but I can't change the past. The only thing I can do is make tomorrow better than today, but I just don't have the energy and I haven't for a year. 

Most of the time it's not too bad, just laying around, getting up playing videogames (when I gather the strength to leave bed), working a few hours as a door dasher, and finishing college. Humorously, for the past couple months I've been planning to get up early and work on myself, but it never comes to fruition. sometimes it becomes more then I can bare and it scares me how quick I can turn suic*dal.

 I know there's most likely something more going on, but I don't have the resources to find out what... or the energy to even pursue it. I've let many of my friends go... they probably don't miss me though after all I had to do all the work. I just feel my life coming to an end, and sadly I don't see a way out..."

I couldnt have sex with someone merely based off of attraction, something seen all the time nowadays while everyone hooks up with whatever stranger at a party they found attractive and in the end I realize that I cant help but detest nearly everyone I meet and nearly everyone I know. Granted I secretly detest or cant relate to nearly everyone I know but I pretend I like them or can relate to them out of wanting to be polite or because being around them gives me something entertaining to do."

Guilty_Swordfish,2022-02-08 06:12:08+00:00,Some Thoughts on Depression,"I’m tired of people telling me to snap out of it by sheer willpower. It’s very unrealistic. When I feel this way, I have no will to live, let alone do something that would make me feel better. Why would I do so something to help the person I despise for his inadequacy and flaws, that is myself. It’s the way it colors my overall outlook on life, and exhausts me, robbing me of my will. Will inspires action, and without it, there is no action. All I can do in the moment is hope that the next morning, life will feel a bit more bearable. 

I feel like I’m cursed to never be happy again. I’ve hardly ever felt worse than I have since my ex broke up with me. She was my main friend, and now she’s finding love and thriving, while I’ve never wanted to end it more than in these past.

Every time I’ve tried to find love, or even a momentary connection outside of my family since, it’s been a letdown because others don’t like me or feel like I’m worth it. If that’s the general consensus, maybe it’s true. I wish I could stop living without hurting those I love.

Others who might be reading this are worth it, and should seek help, but I’m afraid I’m a lost cause."

Ok_Tiger_8188,2022-02-08 01:38:15+00:00,My honest depressing routine,"I'm a 25 year old man living in a third world country, small country, this is my depressing routine during the week (working remotely for now)

My routine from monday to friday

- I wake up at around 7:30AM I hit snooze 
- I skip the first 30-60 minutes of work starting at 8:00AM,  wake up feeling horny fantasizing about having a boyfriend and I  watch gay porn and jerk off at least 2 times hump the bed wearing my pjs and underwear on until I cum, roght after that I listen to asmr ""cuddling boyfriend roleplay"" on youtube, hug the pillow as if it was imaginary boyfriend, and put the phone under the pillow to listen to it through my pillow, I get more sleep, then I wake up, I doomscroll, get in touch with the celebs I obsess over. (My curtains always remain closed cause my bully used to live next to  this apartment and I cant stop my mind from  obsessing over it)
- around 8:30AM to 9AM I do my first daily task at job which is to update some reports... after that, I go back to social media and start overthinking about my life and my future, thinking of all of the things I'm so indecisive about that have been stacking up in the back of my head? then I pee and poop, when I poop im too tired to wipe it off so i I jump in the shower and wash it off... i have manic episodes, or whatever it is. I start making weird faces and crying while i'm in the tub.
- then my mom knocks the door and brings me breakfast.
- I have to put something on, cause by the time she knocks my door I am still wearing my cum stained underwear so I put my pjs that are on the floor hoping she wont smell the dry cum. Most of the time I wear those cum stained underwear/pjs for days without taking a shower.
- I receive the food and I thank her. Then I put the tray somewhere in my desk and spend at least 3 hours eating my breakfast. I make sure my remote pc doesn't go to sleep, so I can appear available at work all the time. While I eat, I spend a bunch of time talking to myself or on youtube watching people have better lives than mine and asking the google bar about ideas of how to end my pathetic life cause I feel like everything is a chore. 
-  I do some tasks at work in between but I try to control it by doing the minimun.
- my mom brings lunch at 3pm
- i eat it fairly fast... the dishes are piling up in my room  and ants are starting to invade.
- I spend all of my day from 8 to 5 locked in my room...
- Everytime I go out of my room to the kitchen or another room I feel ashamed of myself so much that I have to run back to my room. We have a huge window in the kitchen and our neighbors can easily watch my depressing  pathetic self and I get anxious and I cant do anything other than running away.
- at 5pm I start watching porn again and masturbating. 
My fetishes are scat fart and macrophilia. Thisvid is my preferred site. 
- then I do asmr and then masturbate again, doomscroll, cry, have meltdowns until 1AM and then I realize its too late. I get up from bed and take all of the dirty dishes to the kitchen. Sometimes I brush my teeth before sleep, most times I dont. And then I masturbate again. Then I start obsessing over my skin concerns, my sex life concerns, feeling like im not worthy of sex, feeling too ugly, feeling like nothing inspires passion, nothing is interesting.

From saturday to sunday

 I just doomscroll and watch porn and eat random things. Sometimes my older sister is visiting the house so I come out and greet her and her dog. Then I go back into my room. Sometimes I go out to help my mom with the chores but I always have to do it fast because the shame is making me want to lock myself in the room.

Occasional 

I occasionally  go out to cut my hair or maybe buy something using drive through. I always use the same old clothes, I look like a hobo, because Im terrified of malls and stores i get anxiety and feel terrible going out to those places but also I never find clothes that look good on me. I also cant buy online cause I dont know what to buy im always indecisive.

Plans/Future worries

I want out. I would love to leave this country and start living. I feel like my country has nowhere to go,  I cant relate to the culture,  everything reminds me of my past, and I'm always scared of bumping into people who know me from my past cause they would want to know about my life and i have nothing to say, everything seems chaotic. I cant imagine living a normal life in here. I would love to have a boyfriend someday or get married but there's still a huge stigma around homosexuality and I struggle to accept it in here. I hate my job... i feel like im not meant to the corporate jobs and I should become an artist cause I used to like video editing and singing and filmmaking. I would love to live a life like Niklas Christl.

Anyways, Ive been trapped in this routine for 2 years. And everytime I try to get myself out, its impossible. The same day keeps repeating and the hours are just passing by. I feel like the shame of being this person for a long time makes it impossible to overcome this. Its a vicious cycle. And im always fighting with myself in my head and im scared and my stomach feels tense and I cant walk normally and everything makes me dizzy or feeling out of place... the anxiety that i get when trying to write down a plan to get out of this hole keeps me in this place... i dont know where to start and my mind is full of worries. I always have an urge to kill myself"

People have told me that I should be thankful of what I have and that I have friends and family. And I am, but that doesn't mean I can just flip a switch and be happy. I hate being alone and not in a relationship with someone. I feel so empty when I wake up in the morning alone and when I go to work and see couples being happy. I just don't know how much longer I can take this. It's like somethings wrong with me and I don't know what it is or I'd fix it. I just...want to be happy with someone and for her to be happy with me"

I’d do it myself, but there’s a high chance that they’ll see it immediately after I send it and will stop me. Or at least make my suicide that much sadder as they beg for me to not pull the trigger. No, I would rather them be contacted after I’m gone. So, if you’d like to help me with this, we’ll work out more details. Ideally, I don’t want you to be as suicidal as me, because if you decide to kill yourself before I do I’ll have to find someone else to do this. Anyway, leave a comment or send me a message if you are willing to help me out with this."

I have no goals or dreams in my life. Nothing gives me 1% of happyness. Every day i am alone and depressed and i rly dont know what to do anymore. I am not sure how much longer i can take this. I think i dont have the balls to kill myself even though i tried it a coupple of times 2-3 yrs ago. The only way i can see myself commiting suicide is by making it look like a accident. But i dont want to hurt my family and the coupple of friends i still have. I am also very scared to go to therapy because the last time i did that they wantet to put me in a psychiatry but i want to finish my education first. After that i might consider therapy. And if i dont or it does not help then i will probably be dead soon. Sorry for this long ass text but i cant rly talk about my feelings with people i know.

Squisssles,2022-02-07 10:25:26+00:00,I don't know what to do,"So I had this girl in my Social Science class last quarter and now she's in my Biology class. I like her, but I found out she's already gotten a boyfriend ever since she was new in Social Science. I'm kinds lost right now and don't know what to do. When she first came in in Social Science, I was instantly attracted to her because she was very cheerful and optimistic.

For note, I'm a very pessimistic person and I felt like she was the one. I know it's cringey to say, but I felt like I needed someone that was optimistic to make me happy. I just want to be her friend, but every time I look at her, I feel this sense of despair because I know I'm NEVER going to talk to her--that's how much of a low self-esteem I have. I don't know what to do, but do nothing. I feel like it's too late to talk to her."

The 2 goals I’m working towards (purchasing a car, moving by June) are requirements rather than anything that brings me joy. Ofc I need to do both of those things. Otherwise, I’ll be 1)homeless 2) severely limited as i have been for the last decade without a car. Lately I don’t have time for anything I enjoy. Last year when I was healing, I took yoga and dance classes, I almost enrolled in sewing classes. These are distant, impossible things now. I work a retail job and it’s the best I’ve ever been treated at a workplace. I was recently promoted to management. It is somewhat aligned with what I’m passionate about (a health food store) but the thought of having to spend 8 hours of a day there for the next 5-10 years makes me want to end it. Idk what to do. I feel like a worthless member of society. I would never want to do sex work but often feel like that is my only way out of the work I do now despite having a college degree. The funniest thing is $100,000 would free me of most of my stressors. I feel lost and like I never had to find myself in the traditional way. Yes I am in therapy and can’t fucking afford it (insurance doesn’t pay for that ) yes I was medicated up until 2.5 months ago bc side effects. As of now despite having a partner and friends (neither of whom I’ve seen in ages) I feel fucking terrible and worthless."

I just want things to be the way they’re supposed to be before this crap happened. But the sad thing is those days are over forever, even with a vaccines and treatments. 

For those who prefer it this way forever, you can have it. Because I refuse to adapt and I don’t wanna be a part of this life.

It wasn’t just as a kid that I was hated. It was my entire life. From High School band kids to students in my college TV classes, jobs, and also online. 

The sad thing is that they had every reason to. I was immature, hyper, and had a temper. All of this because of my autism and the fact that I was a bad kid and now a horrible person. 

I try to be kind and nice, but looking back makes me realize that I am a bad person. And that others see kindness as a weakness, not a strength. 

My 34th birthday is this month and I’m not looking forward to it honestly. It’s the first one without my Dad, the new normal is here to say, and nobody will ever like me.

I love my son and want to be around for him, but sometimes, I wish I would have fulfilled my fantasy of leaving everything behind when he was just a year old. idl what to do, who to go to, or even talk to, so I came here.

endisnear7,2022-02-07 03:11:28+00:00,Being bullied after moving schools has changed me,"Since childhood I was always raised to defend myself. I was taught self defence for periods of time by my dad which resulted in me being fairly good at self defence.

Well, for my first year of high school I was somewhat of a class clown and would get into fights a lot to avoid being bullied. It sort of built up a confidence when people started to respect me because I could fight pretty well.

This all changed when I moved schools when my second year of high school started. I was the new kid so I was a target, and obviously my personality at my old school wasn't known at this new school. I was targeted, called a racist on my first couple months. I retaliated to someone who deleted my work on the school computers by slapping their hand away from a keyboard. Apparently that makes me a racist. I was bullied relentlessly for around 3 months straight after that by the popular kids. My confidence was crushed to be honest, and I was isolated as the new kid.It made me think about how I was at my old school. How I was the class clown and had some sort of power over the class, I could pretty much say what I wanted in the middle of class. I felt bad about how I acted back there sometimes. I wasn't that bad but I was annoying to the other students.

Anyway, in my third year at this school I'm still getting treated badly by other students. But at this point I'm more focused on something else, I had an eating disorder and was suicidal. I had been that way since before high school had even started with suicidal thoughts but they blossomed more after being treated as an outcast by the school. I was often told things like ""You should fuck off out of this school"" and that I didn't belong there. I was also outed by a group of ""friends"" after we fell out. Which meant I got bullied and treated as an outcast for being gay on top of all that.

I couldn't even salvage any friendships that I had back in my old school, because I'd argued with the only couple friends I had and they hated me. I sent a message trying to apologise to them but they told me to fuck off and that they didn't want anything to do with me. They did usually treat me badly back in the first year of high school but I put up with it to stay somewhat popular and so I wouldn't be bullied by them.

I'm in my fourth year of high school right now, which is my second to last year of school. My family keep telling me ""You have less than 2 years left. you'll be fine"" But I don't know if I can last that long. I've become such an anti social person that I had to go to therapy because I was terrified of leaving my house in case I saw someone from school. Now I'm afraid of all interaction with people my age, I just assume I'm going to get bullied by them. Being bullied has turned me into a weak person to the point that stepping outside of my house gives me major anxiety.

I'm so lonely that when someone who sat next to me said a couple of things to me that weren't insults I started to think about them all the time. I still can't get this person out of my head because that's the only good things anyone at that school has ever said to me. I'm being home schooled right now because I flat out refused to go back there. So I have to walk to the school with my work when everyone leaves school which makes me want to cry when I see them all flooding out of the school. But this is the best option for me for now, there's not much else I can do."

Meds aren't helping. 

I'm just sinking. 

Laying down I feel myself drifting away and I wish I would just be unalive. 

I'm exhausted. 

Life is so much more complicated than it needs to be. Life doesn't get easier, it gets complex and you learn how to organize it. Doesn't mean you're good at it. You just learn how to mask. 

I need meds to function normally and lately they just don't work.

I know that he is used to self harm and attempted suicide multiple times too. I often see him vent on Twitter as we don't see each other at school since we aren't in the same one anymore. It pains me so much to see him that much in distress but I don't know what to do to help him anymore, I'm so bad at conforting people. I don't know what to say, I hate myself for that, he's such a nice person it's just so painful to see him hating on himself everyday. I feel so bad especially when he posts those kind of messages like ""no one will miss me anyways"" reading this kind of thing really makes me realize how much useless I am as a friend, I try to help him as much as I can but it's not possible, especially since I am not always able to see his messages as soon as he posts them. I'm really scared that one day I'm gonna read his last message without even knowing it because I wasn't enough present for him in a rough time"

Crow_of_Odin,2022-02-06 22:54:04+00:00,"New Year, New Depression","Not gonna lie, I was high-key excited for 2022 because it was supposed to kickstart off a new chapter in life that's based on self-confidence 5-years-in-the-making. Instead I got slapped right in the face with some heavy-handed depression coming and knocked back onto the insecure train. So needless to say it's been a fun start to the year.. 

I'm 27, a closeted bisexual, struggling to get healthy, working in a hospitality dead-end job (which requires allowing people to suck your soul away little by little), my secret girlfriend lives in another continent, my favorite co-worker is quitting, I've lost contact with so many friends, people constantly in a state of hysteria over the next newest threat to humanity (nothing new but people are just way over the top now), and my parent's are head-over-heels involved in some weird conspiracy-cult stuff. The list could go on forever... 

I've struggled with depression before in high-school and most of my teenage years, but damn. The apathy be hitting harder than before, honestly getting out of bed or even getting dressed for work feels like a fucking chore and a half in itself. It doesn't help we're severely understaffed with a new GM nobody knows anything about, everyone's feeling the pressure to ""fake it until we make it"" so nobody gets fired, while simultaneously pushing every department to do triple the work. With my favorite co-worker who's really the only one I've clicked with and fully understands me, leaving, it just feels ultimately hopeless and impossible to give even the slightest hint of a fuck about the guests. 

My girlfriend's a huge part of my support system, but she lives in another continent. She's also a med student and lives with her parents (who also don't know she's gay), so it's a balancing act of her constantly hovering family, studying for an upcoming residential exam, and me. I feel really left behind, but I also feel selfish because I understand she's so busy??? I'm constantly overthinking our relationship, since I've never had one before. We're going on 3 years together, so I guess I should just chill out.. 

Despite the insanity a few of my former friends put in me through, I miss them. Especially one who in his last months of me knowing him was unknowingly high on meth at work and accused me of being a spy, then got mad at me for getting a supervisor involved. Still he was my only local, openly gay friend and really introduced me to the gay community (which as someone closeted to their family is such an amazing experience). Unfortunately the gay district is in a rather dangerous part of town and going as a female by yourself is not great? Not to mention, COVID killed most of the scene. 

As for my health-kick, I've always been heavy-set and had issues with my hair. It's taken a long time to be okay with myself and semi get my hair issues under control, now that's kinda gone majorly out the window. I've been working out for at least 2 hours a day and trying to eat healthy, but since getting my thyroid med dosage adjusted (I have hypothyroidism) I've actually GAINED weight along with bad skin, facial hair growth, zero energy, and major hair loss. All that confidence I've built up is kinda out the window now. 

COVID's basically ruined my family dynamic since 1/3 of my family has a crippling fear of interacting with anyone, the other 3rd is back to normal, and the last (my parents) have joined some weird Kabbalah-type cult that believes Satanic vampiric reptilians have invaded the world governments in order. Honestly, I can't have conversations about any level of society with anyone anymore without them either going EXTREME COVID Karen (which honestly is how most of the people I encounter at my job are). 

Life just fucking sucks yo. I'm really tired of feeling like a useless, empty bag flapping desperately outside a trucker parking lot..."
ZakLCM,2022-02-06 21:44:19+00:00,I've never felt so alone,"A few months ago I stopped speaking with people who don't really speak to me and it's caused me to lose some friendships, all of them actually. I just felt like I was the only one actually trying to have conversations. I've made some more friends since this but only talk with them at school. We don't really have the same interests to talk about outside of school so we just don't. It's pretty much talking about the school work and telling jokes.

Last night I had a dream and the emotions of just talking to someone made me realise that I am actually alone. I don't usually feel alone, I'm sort of happy chilling by myself. But I don't have anyone to talk to about anything. I look around and see everyone is doing good in school, have their own jobs and thinking about the future. Then I look at myself and realize I'm just hoping to get through the day without trying to kill myself. I'm not doing great in school, don't have a job and don't really want to live in this world. I feel incredibly alone in what I'm going through."

nostalgiapathy,2022-02-06 14:21:12+00:00,Appropriate response.,"I was talking with my therapist the other day, and communicated to him a line of thinking I have been exploring about depression and psychological ""dis""-""ease"". It seems to me that modern society is having a direct impact on lives of individual members within. The way we live, produces psychological disorders. On top of that, are the events in every individuals life as well.   


My point is, depression is a completely normal, healthy, natural, and expected response to the world we live in or the situation we find ourselves in. For example, if you are belittled and abused by the people who are supposed to love you, and you are trapped in a house with them because you are too young to be on your own. When you go to school, people make fun of you for some reason you cant control. In a situation like that, depression is a completely understandable and natural response. In fact, it would seem unlikely and abnormal to be content and happy in a situation like that.   


Now, take that situation, and add to the fact that we have social media destroying our self esteem, we bear witness to suffering and injustices of other members of humanity all over the world through the internet. People are more isolated, less authentically connected, even though we are literally connected at any moment in time with the internet. It is not acting as a viable substitute in most circumstances. For the average person, and even worse, young person, the internet and social media in particular can be a devastating force in their lives.  


There's a cool little story that I heard a while ago which kind of reminds me of this dilemma. There was a rice farmer. Farming rice was his livelihood, it gave him purpose, and meaning. He was able to support his family and he had an identity. One day he severely hurt his back. After that moment he was no longer able to farm his rice. He became extremely depressed, he could barely get out of bed let alone be out bent over farming his rice. So, eventually he decides that he cant take it anymore so he goes to the doctor. The doctor examines him, and takes into account the circumstances of this  mans life. He ends up prescribing the man a cow. The cow he will be able to milk, and it will be a good source of income for his family to replace the rice and it wont be too physically hard for him to accomplish.   


If the events and circumstances of our lives are what is causing a completely natural and healthy response of being depressed, than the prescription for that, is changing those circumstances. The problem is, we can only control so much, and all of those existential crisis society is facing right now can still be too much. 

My point is, theres is nothing wrong with you. In fact, you are actually having a normal response to the life you find yourself in. Its actually the people who are going along like nothing is wrong that are abnormal. We are all in this together. &lt;3"
ShineLokabrenna,2022-02-06 12:39:28+00:00,the hardest thing is when your friend suffers,"My best friend and I are both pretty mentaly ill. We share anxiety, but I get depressed while they have BPD. We are quite the pair. 

My best friend means a fucking lot to me, I love them so much. However, seeing them suffer brings about a differenr kind of pain thats even more intolerable than when I personally feel shitty. I feel so restless, like I have to do something now for them or the world ends. Dramatic but true. Its an itchy, restless pain. I just want to help, but I can only do so much and its frankly infuriating. Im sure many people, even those who arent mentally ill- can relate a bit. My anxiety makes it worse though, because seeing them in pain makes me break down too. Am i not good enough? Could someone else do it better? Am i making things worse? Its stupid stuff.

The one thing i realised tonight is that I can never kill myself. I couldnt inflict that kind of pain onto my friend when they are suffering so much themselves. Their family isnt great with mental illness and even tho they have lots of lovely friends, non are as close as me. They would be alone without me. 

Its selfish, but i feel trapped moreso now than ever. Its like the reality hit me, I cannot die or they might as well. My loss would devastate them. I cant take away that happiness from them. I feel lost and confused right now. I wish things were easier"

Internet points don’t validate me or my message. I write this because I’ve been there. I’ve lost people, I’ve stared down the barrel of a gun, slit my wrists, been in and out of therapy and on and off of more drugs than I can count all before I reached adulthood. I’m writing this so you know that I made it, and if my dumbass can, you definitely can too.)

That being said, everyone’s situation is different, and no, its never easy, but given enough time, enough opportunities, it’s always possible. 

People love you. I love you. Even if you don’t see it, don’t hear it, don’t feel it, it’s there. You are trying your best, and that’s all that’s required in life. It will take time and it will take effort. You can’t change your life for the better without fighting with everything you’ve got, and when you run dry, you still have to give more. That’s what it takes, but I’m rooting for you. Because I know you’re capable. How? You’re like me, human, and humans are terrifyingly resilient. 

A woman named Jean Hilliard at 19, had crashed her car in a ditch and then froze to the subzero temperature of -22 degrees centigrade. She was so frozen that her skin could not even be pierced by needles, they just broke on contact.
Her body temperature was so low that it didn’t register on a thermometer!
And even though the medical staff thought she was dead, they decided to gradually warm up her body with heating pads. Alas, they got a faint pulse of 12 beats per minute. She’s still alive today. That’s how much the human body wants to live, to fight. So let it. Easier said than done, I know, but you’re not stuck. You’re not trapped. Your wounds, your pains, are temporary. Just stick with me. Be patient. Fight.

I know it may not be much, but I’m here if you need me. Even if you just want to hear some kind words. I’ll be honest with you, I’ll respect you. I can’t solve your problems, I may not even help in the end, but I will always be supporting you. If nothing else, remember this, don’t isolate yourself, and communicate. Spend as much time around healthy association as you can. They’ll reinforce you. Build your confidence. Isolation won’t. And remember to communicate your feelings to others often. As much as you may not want to, it’s a good habit to build.

(P.S. that saying about the light at the end of the tunnel is one of my favorites. It works well as an illustration. You can’t expect to make it through a dark and unknown tunnel without the right equipment or tools, you might want to bring a friend, possibly one who’s familiar with dark tunnels, and let others know of your journey just in case they need to come to the rescue.

Similarly, in life you need to prepare your mind and body for changes before you make them. Having the right tools in place makes a huge difference.

laurnbassoon,2022-02-05 23:32:39+00:00,love.,i’m sitting here babysitting my 3 year old brother and sobbing. he has no idea that i’m crying and i’m just watching him play. i have so much love for him and my 2 other brothers and my family and friends. i just want to feel like i’m capable of being loved by someone who won’t take advantage of me. every relationship i’ve been in has been me ending up being treated poorly and i want to be in a stable relationship with someone who loves me. i don’t know why i’m always getting hurt or pushed aside. i want to be loved.

I_am_a_PAWG,2022-02-05 21:55:52+00:00,What did I do to deserve this life?,"One thing with COVID, it's forced me to realize just how lonely I am.   I've been sitting in my house for over a year now and I'm about to the  end of it.  I have no real friends, I'm friend making adverse anytime I  do get a friend it ends up being someone just wants to take from me; is  only interested in me when they want something from me.  I have no  prospect of ever getting a girlfriend or ever having children is fast  slipping away.  I'm not ugly or mean.  I'm just fucking shy and cannot  say the right thing at the right time.  Of course now that I've failed  so many times I don't even try or if a woman talks to me first I just  leave cause why bother.  I've watched so much porn at this point it's  all the same and I mostly just watch it for a while to waste time or  just stare out the window.  I've given up on all the games in my Steam  library, any time I try to start one or start playing something I use to  enjoy from a save I make it about 10 minutes.  I don't know what I did  to deserve this life.  
Anymore I just spend my weekends blankly  staring out the window.  Then see a neighbor walk past with his family and wish I could have that...but know I never will."
Kashyapm94,2022-02-05 21:51:15+00:00,Been hitting new lows,"After being 3.5 years in a relationship, my ex started realising that she is polyamorous and is in love with the boyfriend of her cousin. She had chosen to reveal this when I was visiting my parents in my home country and broke up with me when I was there. She didn’t even wait for me return back so that we could talk about it. 

Ever since the breakup, i feel completely lost. Previously I knew what I wanted to do in life and how to do it but since the breakup I just don’t know anything. I feel like my confidence has hit rock bottom and I don’t know where my life is going right now and what I actually want to do.

And more recently, like 4 weeks ago, a really good friend of mine started ghosting me because she started developing feelings for me (and to a certain extent, i too started having feelings for her). She started keeping her distance from me and I realised that. Only when I asked her about it and when she acknowledged that she’s keeping her distance on purpose, it just hit me real hard. She said that she’ll text me in 3-4 days and it has been more than 3 weeks. The moment she acknowledged that she’s keeping her distance from me on purpose, I felt myself hit new lows. Emotional, physically, personally and professionally I felt lost and broke and burned out. It feels like I’ve lost a really good friend of mine just because we got too close to each other and started developing feelings. 

All of this along with the breakup is just making things hard for me. It feels like I’m hitting new lows. I try to keep myself busy by working, reading, gymming and it does help to an extent, but when there is a moment of free time, my mind starts  wandering and those thoughts hit me again and make me sad and unmotivated to do anything .

These days, since my friend has started ghosting me, I feel unmotivated to do anything. Before I used to start working by 9am but these days despite waking up by 8am, I don’t feel like getting out of the bed and I stay in the bed till like 9:30 and start working late. 

I spoke to a friend of mine about all of this and she feels that I’m showing signs of depression. I don’t know if she is right or not, but each day is just really hard."

Im depressed, I'm a male and trying to find a girlfriend, but feel time is running against me, I want a family and a future with someone.

These dating apps are soul destroying, I do meet women at other places and have had girlfriends. But it's got to the point now where I feel so unwanted it makes my chest tight and I feel so numb. I really wish I could die to save face and the torments of being alone."
0g_s1m0n,2022-02-05 21:18:16+00:00,how do I?,"I keep getting told to 'stop feeling sorry for myself'... 
But i don't know how? Ive had lots of bad news lately (father dieing, bullied at work, stepping down from management, along with other stuff) 

I'm not trying to make excuses."
Mx-Stranger,2022-02-05 20:17:52+00:00,Just venting I guess,"I originally posted this to CPTSD but thought maybe it belonged better in a depression sub. I do have CPTSD, but I think these past few months I’ve been depressed again. I was on anti-depressants for a few years so I was fine. Think I probably need them again…. How much of this is relatable?

***

Been struggling a lot lately between mental and physical health. Recently I got hit with a big vet bill for my dog so I messaged my sister for help and she told me she can’t help (I figured it meant more like she won’t help). Then the next day she said she was tired and drained with helping me because there’s always something new.

And I mean, like yeah, I get it. I’ve distanced myself from a lot of friends because I didn’t want to drain them with my fatigue and depression. And I tried to distance myself from her a few months ago too but I did see she was trying really hard to help me so I tried really hard to let her help me (and I did mention that).

So I said to her it’s probably better I leave you alone then because I can barely even stand myself anyway. And her reply to that was… don’t keep things to yourself, don’t hold stuff in. Like… I was trying to be open with her but she shut me down by saying she was drained, is the ironic thing. And I respect that, so now I can’t express myself can I?

I don’t have anyone else. No other family. No close friends. One friend that doesn’t really know me, but is a good person so I compartmentalise everything ‘bad’ about myself so as not to drain them either. That’s basically how it is for me.

I need to go back to therapy but can’t afford it right now. So… I just have my journal. It was just the irony of being told “stop sharing your problems with me” and then when I express that I should distance myself get told “don’t keep it all to yourself.”

IDK."

How long does it take for Zoloft to work
----------------------------------------
Note: I don't know if science can help
           me because I suffered severe
           depression for a very long time
           it's already on a stage where
           difficult-to-treat, but I believe
           to those smart people developing
           and researching on this medicine.

First month
 - I don't feel or experience any improvements
 
Second month
 - I feel a little, just only little improvements
    and I started losing hope but I still give
    another month

Third month
 - I started comparing myself before I started
    medication and I notice differences and also
    I feel some improvements

Fourth month
 - At this time I am happy because I completely
    feel my improvements I started talking, I
    started functioning I don't feel sad anymore
    I can prove that there is improvements at
    this time. Yeheyy

Fifth month
 - At the last two weeks of this month I started
    lowering my dosage to 25mg because
    I think I am completely okay, I started talking
    I started functioning, I don't feel sad I
    to go outside, I feel very light, I feel happy
    and okay now and this is the last month
    I stop taking zoloft because I feel completely
    okay now.


3 months later...
  - I feel that I suffered from mild depression
     but finally I know that I am not completely
     healed from depression because I
     stop taking Zoloft at the very early stage
     because I thought I am already healed.


Sixt month
  - I go back taking Zoloft 50mg at the morning
     on empty stomach, at this time I now only
     have mild depression, still feel
     improvements.

Seven month
  - At the end of seven month I am completely
     free from depression, I am completely
     healed, and I am now experience living
     a normal life.

still taking zoloft 50mg at the morning on
empty stomach, and right now don't have
any plans on quitting Zoloft, I will continue
taking Zoloft

ThingWorried,2022-02-05 04:46:32+00:00,Staying in going out (poem about living with my depression),"
Today all i want to do is sit im my room and pout 

I wanna fill the space between my walls with swimming fish and prickly doubt

I wanna build cities on the banks of my door frame so i can plant puny pink posies and see them sprout

I wanna raise cattle on the plains of my carpet so i can brush the fluffy fur around thier fuzzy snouts 

I wanna build a school on the grassy hill of my shag rug so i can listen to reckless children run and play and shout

I more or less am going to sit im my room and pout and tomorrow when im done

I'll pull out the sun and watch swimming fish be be suffocated like fresh caught trout 

I'll flood flower filled banks and and let my cites fall into drought

I'll send my cattle to a forest of clutter so they may  freely roam about 

Ill cancel the school day and let reckless
Children relearn to count 

Tomorrow i will go into the world with a smile but today i am going to pout"
Bubbly_Rise,2022-02-05 04:37:19+00:00,how long have you gone without showering while going through a depressive episode?,"I'm ashamed with how long I've gone without showering while depressed. I really cant say because i need to know if anyone else has also gone just as long. I need to know if my inability to shower is the same as other people or if I'm just being lazy. It honestly frustrates me so much that I cant just get into the shower. That the mere thought of preparing for a shower is so tiring. And it frustrates me that I get so upset with myself when the day is over and I haven't showered. And the feeling of all the dirt and buildup on my body just keeps me depressed for longer. 

So, please let me know whats the longest time you've gone without showering so i can feel not so alone in this situation. And I suppose if no ones gone as long as me, then I am just lazy and am using my depression as an excuse. I sincerely hope that is not the case."

master_roshi_07,2022-02-05 01:12:28+00:00,Who else is depressed because of being fat?,"I can't sleep because of constantly thinking about how much I suck in life because of being fat. During the day I feel sad because of that, even when eating, being it healthy or trash food, doesn't matter..
Otherwise I have everything, I am healthy (obesity aside), I have friends (even though I am more and more ashamed of myself and hence go out much less), I am funny (but actually I am getting more shy and serious because of not feeling ""worthy"") and I am smart (even tough I don't like to consider myself smart because I like the idea of having to know many other things and there are people out there much more brilliant than me). I am lucky to have everything in life, at least the essential things.

However when I try to lose weight and succeed it always happens that smth bad goes on and then I refall and regain all the weight I lost (or more). My family also cannot eat healthy, always have to eat tasty caloric things which makes everything much harder.

This leads to a unhappy 23 yo guy of 230 pounds/ 104 kg who feels depressed because he knows it is a simple solution problem {calorie deficit + working out and that's it} but it's beeing ages he cannot overcome it.
He feels unworthy of having a girl who loves him because of not giving the best of himself, he closes on himself and thinks he is a poor fat looser, also he is feeling he is cringy when speaking with people because they don't deserve speaking with a fat guy.

I am tired...

baencakes,2022-02-04 21:53:22+00:00,When will life get better?,"Before I joined the military, I was homeless time and time again. I worked various jobs ($7.25-$12/h) where I would stay as long as I could until I could find something that allowed me to work more hours (40 hours minimum). Even then, life was a struggle. Me and my husband barely survived. We were always worried. I was scared. Now that I’m making a stable income, it’s my turn to help my husband. I’ve gotten him into staffing agencies that unfortunately won’t call back. Tug boat companies, oil, lumber, pipeline, no luck. I remember a time when one guy got hired as a deckhand without graduating HS because his older cousin was working there. My husband is fully able and qualified to work too! I don’t understand it. I’m sad for him because it’s not fair. The rest of my family is homeless and my life outside of the military has fallen apart. I see less than decent people from my community snag well-paying jobs. If I ever ask them for help they suggest sexual favors from me and it breaks my heart. Life shouldn’t be this hard. Why is it this hard? I don’t know what to do anymore."
UnicornGM,2022-02-04 21:15:57+00:00,Thrown under a bus,"Last week I was thrown under the bus by two separate groups of friends.  


One was over a video game I had joined a group and being new did not have all the items the vets of the game was asking me to use. Some members of the group felt disrespected when I used an item in the game I was comfortable with over an item I did not have. The leader of the group talked to me and I agreed to try and listen a bit more to the person who had issues. Four months after the talk with the leader I was kicked from the group without warning and was not explained why I was kicked or what I had done. It turns out that the people I had been listening to still had an issue with me, instead of talking to me on it ahead of time to get my side of things I got thrown under a bus and kicked for no reason at all.   


The second group was someone who I looked up too and respected. I had known them for 3 years plus at the moment. I had been running a table top game for their group. They did not want to play or want to learn. As time went on they began to slowly take control away from me on things I needed for the game. Adding new players. dealing with problems on my own, they had to have their hands in everything I did and kept saying it was my game. My friends and players all vote and agreed to move the game somewhere else for more freedom and because there was drama my friend was getting tired of dealing with. This was to help them out and not cause them any more drama for their group. They were fine with it one day and the next they felt I had betrayed them going as far as to call me and my friends all backstabbers. They are now acting like nothing had happened and we are still good friends.   


As a result of these I am hurt, I don't want to do anything but cry or get angry. Nothing sits well on either of these especially the  second one. I am not sure what to do and this is making my anxiety and depression go off the wall."
sscruz138,2022-02-04 20:51:06+00:00,"Today I’m feeling really sad, useless, and like a waste of space","Health conditions have brought me into a really depressive state. I’ve always been an angry and sad person, mad at the world and frustrated with life and having to live this life but my current health conditions have made these feelings impossible to hide any longer. I’m used to bottling up everything but now I’ve been exploding and ultimately puts me into a further depressive state. Not sure how to deal with these emotions anymore. I feel like life can and will only continue to get worse. What’s the point anymore. 

I’m so tired of explaining things to people and I just needed to say this"
iamahotmess420,2022-02-04 20:30:45+00:00,I no longer want to live.,"I've been super depressed recently and it feels like it would just be better if I end it all. I break down crying more than a few times a day, and my family could care less about me. I tried roleplaying and fantasizing to pass the time but it's not working anymore. I might not ever feel real happiness again. And that single thought is like the final nail in my coffin. I guess the next two days will decide how my story ends. I'm sorry I couldn't be stronger."
R-DnB-83,2022-02-04 20:20:51+00:00,Everyone's life is subjective but we live in a society that is built only to be objective and nothing else.,"TDLR: using satire to explain my subjective view on society. I think it's pretty depressingly accurate. Do anything that society doesn't deem appropriate and you're fucked. I've been fucked pretty much the entirety of my life. I have no love left. Being born into this world is a curse. So in order to be happy or have some semblance of how things should be I stay away from other humans and I find solace and peace sat in a field or out in the countryside or anywhere where there is nobody around. 

But, I'm also a realist and in order to 'fall in line' with everyone else , I've mastered the art of camouflage and smoke and mirrors. I've had to master the art of lying and hiding in plain site.. 

Get a job
Get a house
Drive a car
Work for minimum wage
Make other people rich
Get into debt
Do everything society tells you and more
Follow the crowd
The mainstream is the only way 
Have the latest mobile phone
The latest Nike's
Consume consume consume

Then you die.

And still have to pay to be buried as they want to shaft you one last time before you're cold.

Sorry, you're times up. Thanks for coming. Bye now. 

Oh and that's 1 million pounds for us please, we'll just chase it from another one of your still alive family members so it's ok. You haven't got away with it darling. You just died before we could get it off you now we have load all that debt onto someone else. We ALWAYS get paid.

Regards. 

Life. xxx


All my life I've been punished because I wouldn't do what society wants me to do. When I tell people I don't do all these things mentioned then people don't like it. I get judged, I get bullied. It shows me the world is exactly what I know it is.

Is this really life? Or, are we trapped the moment we are born. As kids, they lets us be kids, they let us run around and be free. We could get away with murder. We could do things as kids that as adults we'd probably be locked up in a mental institution. 

They let us get away with it for 18 years. Well, probably around 11 actually, pre teen. But if you behave yourself you can stretch it to 18 and then when your 18. 

There is school of course, school that should set u up to be a as docile and passive as possible. You only learn what we want you to learn. Certain subjects are never taught in schools because we don't want critical thinkers and people who question stuff! 

BANG

you can't do anything that a kid is allowed to do... No, no, no. Oh definitely not. 

You now have to pay to be alive, you have to pay to live your life. You are in debt don't you see? That 18 years of freedom has to be be paid back somehow and you're gonna be paying it back for the rest of your life.

You now have a few choices actually. 

1. Do as you're fucking told, get a job, get married, get into fucking debt, get a minimum wage job and make some one rich for us. Just do everything we tell you and you'll retire on a pittance and maybe get looked after if you end up in hospital but it depends what country you're from whether we hit you with a medical bill you have no chance of ever repaying or you was born into a country with public healthcare. Either you need to have kids so we can do the same to them. Just behave yourself etc etc. We'll do our best while extracting everything you earn off you in bills that only go up but never down. 

2. Learn something, make your own money but you don't get any benefits, you're on your own here. If something happens tough shit. You have to sort it out yourself. Oh and do all the things society wants u to do aswell. Just because you're on your own doesn't mean you get to nope out of anything we say. Got it? Again, behave yourself and they'll be no problem. 

3. Do none of this and live off the grid and live a simple stress free life with no worries.

Oh now, you naughty! It's illegal to not contribute to society you know? You can't make your energy or collect your own water you're not fucking allowed! You can't take from nature. Only society is allowed to do that! YOU FUCKING OWE US. stop living off grid now and come back to society! We will find you, we will arrest you and you will be forced to contribute because it's the law. 

4. In the unfortunate event you have mental health issues then you will be given pills to get better then you will need to follow society as stated in rule one! People will help you but you need to get a fucking grip of yourself! Seriously.. you don't look very ill to us! People will judge you and rightly so! Fucks sake! But yeh.. these pills should make you better if not.. well. We'll just have to make life even more difficult for you because you're clearly not following the rules! 

5. Kill yourself. 

Oh Well, you are expendable. No loss. Someone else will just have to pay for your suicide. Meh. We did our best to control you and we are pretty upset it didn't work but whatever. We aren't the ones in the wrong here. Next!!"

I think it doesn't matter what I do now.  it won't make up for the mistake I made when I was younger. I stay awake at night thinking about it. I'm worried I can't do enough in my life time to make up for what happened and after this life I will go to hell. It worries me.
Financial_Pianist_10,2022-02-04 07:28:14+00:00,At a loss,"Ik it's not a big deal but I'm upset. By dad changing the duvet comforter in ""mom and dads bed"" made me really upset. Obviously I know they are divorced but it's like 1 less thing I can hold onto of family memories. I remember the summer we spent up here when Lauren and I worked at the ide dream store and in the morning I would go snuggle with mom and dad. I remember I got out of wilderness and mom surprised me with this house and a dog, I was so beyond excited! We came down as a family and had so many memories with ultimately came to an end. It hurts to see the house that was once ""our family"" is changing. It hurts to see moms clothes no longer in the closet. It hurts to see that how mom decorated the house is changing into things you buy with your new girlfriend. The chandelier and photos from Italy those are the family memories and I think that will be the last family memorie. Pinky dying was a family memorie, that period of time when he was alive was a great time of all our lives. As mom got chronically sick and dad that's when it all fell apart. Thinking my parents would be together  forever was a lie. I feel like everyday the memories fade more and more. I wish I could be in this lake house and feel that it's the families but I can't because I know dad comes here with a new women and her fucked up kids stay here also. I tell dad I'm not comfortable with that but he ignores my feelings. This is no longer my family house; it has been replaced with memories of future step mother, fading memories of what your ""family"" was, a loss of when your family was ever happy. I wish I could remember the happy days. It's said to have to acknowledge things will never be the same with your family. When we were young wr thought our parents were so happy together and loved each other so much but that was not the case. Once such a happy family; now no family. Once we were all so happy and untied as one to know where there is nothing. Family is split and you don't know what a ""family"" is anymore."

I feel so hopeless, I have nothing to really live for. I don’t want kids, I see no future for me ahead. I’m just simply living. I hate whenever I am like this. Sleep seems to be my only escape but it’s becoming harder and harder to fall asleep. I have people who care about me and love and yet I feel guilty for their love thinking if they’d knew I want to not continue living.

I’m only doing this because I made a promise with someone who pushed me from the dark part of the life a while ago but I stopped opening up to her nowadays. I am afraid, I see no future, I’m exhausted. Sleep doesn’t help, I’m falling apart. I don’t enjoy things I used to love, I’m tired of light sleeping and waking up at instant if anyone enters my room. I’m not lazy, I’m almost a straight A/10 student. I have to prove I’m not dumb somehow right? 

I was sick last week, meaning I had almost 2 weeks where I did nothing, I just slept and how good it was. I’m still tired. I hate when every morning I have to become the nice person and energetic I’m not. Sometimes I’m too tired even for this. 

I’m extremely sorry, I know people go trough so so much worst than me. I have no right to complain about anything but it’s so hard. I usually don’t talk with anyone anymore since they would say people have it worst and I’m loved and cared about so I have no right to do so. I’m sorry"

grayshot,2022-02-03 17:54:08+00:00,I just realized I’ve been depressed for months,"A bit of background - I used to struggle daily with depression combined with an addiction to alcohol that left me alone after pushing everyone away by constantly isolating. Then I started going to a 12 step program, found out I wasn’t alone, and slowly for a few years had friends and eventually became healthy enough for a relationship. 

Then the pandemic started. I couldn’t go to meetings anymore, and all I could do was stay at home. I used this justification to basically isolate for the past 2? years, save for spending time with my family and girlfriend. 

I recently turned 30 and my girlfriend asked who I wanted to invite to my birthday. I didn’t even know who to say, even though just a few years ago I brought my girlfriend to my 1 year of clean time meeting and had 20+ people there to support me. I feel sick. I love my girlfriend and want to marry her, and this is the only healthy relationship I’ve ever had. But I feel so alone and ashamed that I let all my friendships die. I don’t know how to start getting out of this hole I dug for myself. This really fucking sucks."

I’ve been doing everything she says, and she doesn’t acknowledge any of it. Just keeps berating me about what else she needs. 

I’ve been applying to adopt kittens for 6 months and either my application is denied or I never hear back (even when I follow up 3-5 weeks after I submitted).

I dont want to hurt other people and i dont want to hurt myself but its just so fucking difficult and i am hurting. I have meds and plans to see a therapist again. I try to he active, eat well and socalise but its never enough. Theres always something else i should be doing better or less of. Less time in bed, more time excercising, less clarories more vegetables, less time alone more time being with others. Its hurts because ive been trying for so long but i dont feel any better."

I hurt so many people when I was drunk and high to the point that about everyone I ever cared has left me. I feel so bad about myself for all the pain I caused. I wish I could undo all of it, but it's too late now. 
There was this one girl about a year ago with whom I cuddled once but I blew that and she said goodbye for good calling me a sick sociopath just a few days later.
It hurts so much rereading those messages. 
I'll be transferring to a different clinic in 2 weeks where I am gonna spend the next 6 months.

Then another weird thing in my life I just can never understand . It’s that I never ever receive affection or anything from anyone and never. Only way my family shows me affection would be gifts or smth but .. I always give the talks on how much I care , give them a big hug after even though Its out of my comfort zone or etc .

When I talk, they only judge and immediately offer solutions. Maybe I don’t want solutions. Maybe I do. I don’t know what I want and that’s okay too. I have mom guilt every night. My kids don’t know it but I wish I could go back in the day and reset my ways. I am only trying to be the best version of me. This wasn’t what I imagined my life to be. Most days I don’t think I’m cut out to be a mom. I actually think my kids would be better off without me. Whether or not that’s the case, they have me now. I can try my best and hope that they like me sticking around. My husband puts me down, more times than most. I try to act confident but as the days go on, I am less and less the woman I hoped. I cry at night thinking of my dad. He’s dead and has been for years, but can he hear me now? I miss you and love you but also fuck you. Do you see what’s going on or am I supposed to just move on? There is no easy solution, this I know. But what does one do when life is too much? I already see a counselor, take the medication and all. I go to Pilates and drink smoothies, what more? When you are doing the best you can but are still left sore, what does one do but break down to the core. Maybe I could be doing more but if I could I would and maybe certainly should. The problem is I’ll always want more."

Around and around and around and around and around. I bend and stretch and contort, my cries smothered by the howling storm. I long for this storm to pass but it keeps going on. And on. And on. And on.

Head had pressure in it, feel completely numb and clouded. Can’t use my imagination or think in my personality or be connected to myself and other people… has anyone else experienced feeling better at the start? WOULD it be better to take them every other day? I’ve taken two other anti anxiety medications before… and I felt like I do currently.

HelloimTHOR,2022-02-02 14:47:16+00:00,Looking to help motivate others.. 5-8 minute pep talks for $3,"Please delete, don’t ban, if not allowed.

Hi there

I was let go from my job recently and am looking to help others out in the time being. I have always had a passion for helping people get on their feet, but never quite knew how to make that into a career. I have stumbled a lot in life and wish I had someone to call in those moments when I had no one. Hoping I can help someone out there in an affordable way! You can call any time or anywhere you want!

To avoid spam calling, please message me with a brief sentence of what your looking for help on (either long or short term) and I will send you my number!

Couple examples I could give you a pep talk for:

First date
General motivation
Job interview
Starting the day off positively
Developing good/new habits
Just generally feeling down"

akaili89,2022-02-02 11:40:07+00:00,Hate being alone,"
I'm tired of being no one's first choice and never enough
They never ask me how I'm doing, it's like the just see me as a tool to be used 

In don't know what kind of friendship is this, we never hang out, they barely know stuff about me, no pajama parties, no normal parties, no movie/spa nights, no dates no nothing!! 

It kills me because I've always wanted a sister like friendship because I'm an only child, I'm so lonely it hurts knowing I have no one.
In don't even have a boyfriend
Am I that not likeable? Disgusting? Am I asking for too much? Am I destined to be alone and not cared about for the rest of my existence? 

Friends: 

I recently changed my phone number and deleted all my social media and I don't know if I should reach out to my 2 only friends again.
I don't feel appreciated nor respected, i don't know if I miss them or if I just don't want to be alone. 

Sally:
•She always uses me to make her Spanish homework (I do her homework and I'm not even in school myself tf). 

•Never puts effort on my birthday, no presents, we don't go nowhere, no nothing
When I used to put so much effort into her gifts, hand written letters, hand made cakes etc.  One time we were supposed to meet up at a cafe to celebrate my birthday and she never showed up. 

•She uses me as a therapist, always venting, I always try to comfort her and make her feel good, loooong paragraphs trying to hype her up, I go to her house to give her small gifts so she would feel better, and when I try to vent she couldn't care less, always the same generic answers, no thoughtful at all, changes the conversation fast. 

•We used to send each other a lot of posts on Instagram, tiktoks, yt videos, I always reacted and commented to every single one and she didn't! I had to tell her ""hey check the messages I sent"" 

•When I got covid she never asked me how I was! I told her and she was like ""oh so bad"" once and that was all! And when she got covid like 2 weeks ago I was always checking up on her! 

•She never compliments me or anything I do, when I asked advice about college (she has been im 2 diff schools) she was like i don't know I don't care do what you want. 

Daisy:
•She posts everyone on her insa to wish them Happy birthday but me 

•Almost always reaches out just when she needs tech help 

•Was not sure of my birthday date (we have known each other for 11 years). 

•She used to don't gaf when I tried to share things about kpop with her some years ago and make fun of it and now she's SOOO into it just when other girl told her abut it, in don't even like it anymore 

Should I reach out and try to fix this or should I move on?"
uwufemgamerboy,2022-02-02 07:02:55+00:00,This is the year I kill myself,"I've been depressed and suicidal for years, with varying degrees of intensity, and I've generally been pretty hopeless but recently it's really clicked in for me that there is no way out. This is my life forever and I don't want it. I'm going to kill myself so that I don't have to live this anymore"
Pikkils,2022-02-02 05:32:45+00:00,Just venting.,"Everything started the summer before covid, minus the occasional streak of sadness.
 I had a major loss, and depression started. 
I bore with it until I got into contact with a counselor and things got better. 
I go to school, make small talk, go home. 
I play video games, which I dont find endearing anymore. 
I have no need to study because I fetch more than satisfactory grades without effort. 
I have a social life, but choose to secluded myself to opt for gaming instead. 
Nothing has substance to it, everything feels like a chore.
Although I have a healthy circle fo friends, dating doesnt work out. 
Although I get high grades in school, it doesnt feel like enough for me.
I work a dead end job to save for school. It's boring, and all the work is pushed on to me.
All the work, on me.
 Expectations.  
Im expected to be social. I'm expected to have a high work ethic.
I'm expected to go to school, stay up to do my homework, and work to save for tertiary education. Just to be in debt until I'm 50.
For what?
Why do we exist? Why do we develop and understand things?
Why does nothing feel enough? I feel so much more mature and mentally aged compared to people my age (I'm 15M). The only meaningful conversations I get are from adults many folds my age. It's all about work and my future, my grades. All boring. Nothing is endearing, and my favourite activities, like reading, feel like a chore. Talking to people, eating, enjoyable activities, all are chores. The only solace I find is by myself, where I can think. But I think about all the negatives, and menial things in life that compound and make me feel aged. Time crawls by. 

Why must I be this way?"

i was about 4 years old in this story. i was jumping on the couch at my grandmothers house and she walked in after getting off the phone almost pulled me off the couch (i ended up falling back on to it in a sitting position after being pulled off down ish) and slapped across the face while her nails dug into my arm. no warning on this day or any previous one about jumping on the couch./had never been told that rule. was then yelled at and cried in the bathroom afterwards for i have no idea how long. I had bruises on both face and arm for a good while. mom didn't care but it started a fight between my dad and my grandma that lasted hours. in the car while dad was inside my mom said i had deserved to get hit. had also never been told this rule at my parents house and so my trust issues and slef blaming begins to be planted as a tiny seed in my mind.

I never should’ve been born. My mother should’ve aborted me and then my ugly, stupid, worthless self would never have burdened anybody on this planet.

I don’t deserve to be loved by any man. I have no value to any man. The only way I’m ever gonna have value is if I get about $100,000+ of plastic surgery to make myself look like a stripper because those are the only women who can truly make a man happy. A man might marry some regular, below-average woman, but only because he doesn’t have enough money to land the porn star of his dreams. I’ll never be like that, so I’m ready to die.

I’ve always been ugly. I have spent so much money on private make-up lessons and it doesn’t matter what I do…. I’m never gonna look beautiful and sexy. I’m in my mid-30s and most women have had more boyfriends in the last five years that I’ve had in my entire life. And the few guys that have dated me made it clear that I was their last choice and that they were only with me because they were desperate. The other ones who were with me were just using me to have a place to live or to have me buy them stuff…. none of them actually thought that I was beautiful or deserving of respect. And that’s because I don’t deserve respect. I’m not sexy and only sexy women deserve admiration.

I’m going to give y’all some backstory on my depression, because I need to vent for a bit since I’m having an episode. I’m 13, and I’ve had depression since I was 9/10. Back in 5th grade, I was extremely suicidal, and I like to think, and hope, that my depression is getting better. I do have my moments with it though, and here’s a few examples;
Anytime we have breaks from school, instead of doing anything whatsoever, I would just rather lay in my bed staring at the ceiling. I don’t know why, but I just don’t have any motivation to get up. And trust me, I’ve pushed through that every once in a while but it doesn’t change my mood at all.
There’s also moments where, whether it’s the end of the day, beginning, or right in the middle I feel the random need to cry.
Lastly, my parents don’t understand it at all. I know that I’m a teenager, therefore I’m going to feel like my parents don’t understand me, but they only think I’m lazy and trying to get attention most of the time. My dad loves to say that he has depression too but he doesn’t let it get in the way with his life. Idk, maybe I’m being over dramatic, but I’m just not sure. Anyone have any advice for dealing with this?"
CodeOfShadows,2022-02-01 00:06:40+00:00,I have no hope for the future.,"I'm in my early 20's, been depressed for like 10 years. So far life has been a chain of failures and hard-times. It seems like no matter what I do it will always come back to bite me in the ass twice as hard. Don't have any friends or family, don't have any human interaction in general. Everyone I've ever been close with has either abandoned me or stabbed me in the back.

Got covid at work back in November and I just haven't been the same since. I wake up and I'm just as tired as before I went to sleep. Oh and they fired me because ""we're not sure when you will be recovered"". To top it off they then didn't pay me for the last 2 months I did work there so I'm completely broke.

I don't even remember what I was like to feel happiness. Maybe I've just never been happy. It's whatever at this point, idgaf anymore about anything.

I miss the good old days. When all you had to worry about was doing your homework and me and my best friend played Minecraft until the sun would come up. Sadly he became a drug addict and when I didn't follow him down that path, he too abandoned me.

Back in '19 I tried to off myself once already. Or twice in one night if you wanna be technical about it. When I walked out of hospital a few days later I thought things might change. I felt like a burden had been lifted from my shoulders. But here we are just 3 short years later and nothing has changed really. It's just an endless cycle. Wake up, do your work, consume media, go to sleep. Rinse and repeat. Well fuck it. I'm sick of it."

Bhejafried,2022-01-31 14:17:00+00:00,Everything I touch turns to shit,"TLDR

I am almost half a century old with a trail of screwup’s over the past few decades behind me. 

Nothing that I do works out, have had many opportunities to build a good career but have squandered them. Tried to build a business a few years ago from scratch but failed miserably loosing friends in the process as I had borrowed money from them. 

I always had hope that I will make things work and not get into the same shitty situation time and again. The only thing that I have become consistent in is repeating the same mistakes time and again.

Now I feel hopeless.

It’s come to a point that I just can’t focus on anything anymore and any work that comes my way gets messed up. I just give up and land up ghosting the person I am working with. Trust has gone out my personal equation, I simply cannot be trusted to keep my word.

I am frustrated with myself, and don’t see a single positive outcome in anything that I do. Anxiety and self doubt creeps into everything.

Haven’t taken a professional opinion but I think that I am clinically depressed. My partner has no respect for me (and I agree with her) as I have not come clean with my financial transactions.

Trying to finds ways to get out this abyss and be at peace with myself."

But I'm just so sick and tired of everything. I don't want to try anymore. I'm at a point where everything is a constant reminder of how shitty everything is. Things that once made me happy just make me even more depressed as I reminisce about how happy I was a few years ago. Nothing excites me anymore. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I don't want to just repeat the same cycle anymore. Everywhere I go and everything I do doesn't excite me anymore. Everything just feels. Stale. It's like my world has came to a standstill and I'm just waiting out the rest of my days.

I'm not suicidal but I'm just so tired of all this pain and want it all to stop."

Commercial_Rest_9043,2022-01-31 04:16:18+00:00,Can I start over?..,"I feel I’m too far gone. After everything I’ve been through. After trying to be as good a person as I can, I always end up losing those who I would say I was close to. Bouncing around from home to home, going through adoptions and eventually getting kicked out of all my families, be it home wise or connection wise. I never feel like I’m safe or if I’ll even have a safe place to sleep the next day. Always trying to be honest but not able to say if something’s bothering me, and when I do, people don’t want to hear it and leave anyways. No matter how close I get with someone, no matter if it’s been a year or six years, everyone leaves when I finally let them in on how miserable I really am. I put on my masks and walk around like everything’s going fine because that’s what everyone wants. I always hear people say to let others know how they’re doing, but when someone tells me that and I ask them if I can talk to them about it, they leave like I was never there. Cutting ties and never contacting me again. It hurts. I want to restart, hell, even give in to my demons and let them take over. But when I have, I just end up in a hospital hating my life more. I don’t want to keep going on through life, but I can’t seem to even die right. I don’t know wtf I’m supposed to do anymore. I get no pleasure from things I used to enjoy, I’m always tired and trying to sleep to at least be somewhere else but here. I don’t have anyone that I can talk to because they’ve all left, I try talking to my therapist but he doesn’t help me or give me something to go off. I want to go back to drugs because at least there was a high from them, not a constant fall downwards. I miss having the feeling of being happy. It’s been at least a year since I felt truly fine with my life. But even now, I’m just falling more and more to my disassociation and depression, hoping that something will happen so I can be dead. 
I’m stuck, no one to talk to, no strength to keep going or give up. If this is what life’s like, I bet hell would be better."

I've been told to just ignore them or stay away from them, however then I start to worry if they are saying things without me knowing. I just want to be liked. I try to be the best. I try to make people happy. I just want the world to be happy. I don't have the power to do that because I am only one person, however i feel that its my responsibility. I hate myself."

I have such bug issues with validating how I’m feeling and if I do anything positive for myself I do things to make myself feel worse to remind myself that I’m not okay and it’s exhausting. I know it’s so stupid and I’ve been told so many time how dumb it it. 

I don’t take my antidepressants practically fully stop and I isolate myself and overall just don’t help myself. I feel like if I self sectioned I could finally get on track with my medication and be in such a better place. 

But I have such bad issues with feeling like I’m faking it that if I self sectioned I just feel like I’m invalidated and not needing to be there because I put myself there and that I don’t need to be there. 

My family’s also another huge part to play in this because I know they won’t understand and won’t support and I know I should put myself first in this situation but it’s so much easier said than done.

The though as well of being trapped somewhere would scare me.

RedSpleen,2022-01-30 22:00:51+00:00,I'm 26,"Yesterday it's been my bday and I feel like my life is so stupid and meaningless.
Reasons why I hate my life?
I didn't ask to be alive, first of all, but my parents also ""gifted"" me with an autistic brother that doesn't talk and absolutly isn't self-sufficient, since the fact that I am antinatalist/childfree, is pretty ironic thinking about is like I've already have one. 
When they will die, I will have the duty to think about him when I can barely take care of myself.

Another hilarious thing? I have a bf - who is pretty much the only reasons why I am still here - but I can't tolerate his sister who is aaaaaalways around us with her 2 fu**ing annoying babies, but I can't choose between live with him or live in my previous house, because my father is unbearable.
Still, we can not go living together, all alone, because we don't have a job who allows us to do it and covid situation where we live has damaged job-scene more than u could ever think.
Fun fact: my parents insisted to let me inherit an apartment but I don't want it, I don't want to be alive anymore, because of the previous reasons and I would feel guilty If I commit s u i c i d e, because that would mean they sacrificed themself for ... Nothing.

I feel trapped. I hate my life, I hate myself and feel like the only escape is the Misterious Black Lady.
I don't see a meaning in life, generally speaking, and every day is worst worst and worst.

(This hate being one of the only things I've managed some passion for in a long time.) But every time I try, it backfires. Try to loose weight? Gain more. Try to clean my skin? More acne.  Make a friend? I ghost them the minute I start feeling pressured to reply. And that's the way it goes. I've been watching Arcane and I can't help and feel quite like Jinx. Since I somehow \*jinx\* everything I touch.

I know fixing your appearance isn't a magical \*fix it all\* remedy but wouldn't it just be nice to present to others the way YOU want to be? Not to feel like everyone you meet who doesn't like you just doesn't want someone this unflattering around. Eff nature for messing it up in a ""you had one job!"" way, right?  But onne of the worst things is... I feel like I'm so lucky. I have an amazing fiance, place to sleep, enough food and all, the fluffiest dog and if I just put in a little effort day by day, I can enter a career that pays well and isn't entirely terrible to do. 

If I can't manage that effort... is it that I just don't want it enough? I haven't been in enough pain to finally break and push through? Do I ""just"" need an accountability buddy and if so, how do I know they don't talk to me just because my presence would be their instant confidence boost? I should be grateful, I should love the process, I should find joy in small everyday things.

Potential_Sweet_853,2022-01-30 02:26:54+00:00,I Feel like May,"I once read this book, “The Secret Life of Bees,” by Sue Monk Kidd. It’s a great book, but there’s this character named May that I really resonate with. I don’t know how else to describe May other than an extreme empath; she feels the pain of the world as it was her own. She has a wailing wall where she goes to cry. She writes down what was hurting her that day and shoves in between the cracks of the wall. (Spoiler)It’s not an easy job, having all of the pain in the world holding down your heart. One day the pain became too much to handle and she took her own life in a river nearby her home. She was finally free and in a place where she felt no more pain. Honestly, I relate to May a lot. All of the pain in the world weighs on me greatly, especially the pain inside my own world. 

That was more or less an introduction to what I really want to say. I relate to May, truly, but in a different way. I’m scared. I’m scared to watch those around me grow and change, eventually passing away. I’m scared to watch my mom wither and forget me someday. I’m scared to lose my dogs who are aging what seems like too fast. This fear is causing an immense amount of pain, like an extra weight added on to my already severe depression. I want to be like May and leave this world to escape my pain, to alleviate my fear of watching them go. I just want to go to a place where nobody suffers, a place full of love and warmth. I want to go before everyone else in my life, selfish I know. It’s not just that though. I genuinely feel as though I have nothing else to live for. 

I want to stop hurting. I want to leave before it’s too late. 

But I think the worst part is that I know they can bare to live a life without me, but I simply cannot bear to live a life without them.

If you read this, thank you."

I am 19M. When I was 5YO I was sexually assaulted in my playschool, due to the incident i started to stutter. (Till date I stutter).

Life was very difficult in school getting bullied for stuttering, also I was the shortest in my batch (height), kids made fun of me. Things went on the same for next 6 years. Then I was diagnosed with ADHD. I took Fluoxetine for almost 3 years, I didn't went to school for 2 years, just gave the final exams and passed. Reason I didn't went to school was I was depressed. After 3 years I stopped the medication and finally felt like a normal teenager but not for much time. When I was 16 YO I saw a bump in my chest, I went to the doctor and was diagnosed Scoliosis and Pectus Carinatum and excavatum. Though it was mild at that time. My highschool didn't went too well, despite being short in height and stammering, I was socially excluded in my school, people considered me socially awkard to talk with (except of my 2 friends). Well, I didn't go school in my highschool also. 12th grade came and it was all online and my chest deformity was getting worse, my neck also seem shifted to a side due to scoliosis. I couldn't sleep properly due to pectus. I avoided going to the swimming pool due to cosmetical reasons. Then I started hearing a ringing sound in my right ear continuously and I was diagnosed Tinnitus. I then saw a bunion on my feet, it was difficult wearing shoes. (I ain't lying guys).

I was 18 then, I was still 4 inches shorter than my dad (I AM 5'4), my dad always told me he grew with the same trajectory, but unfortunately I didn't end up his height. Though it was late but I took HGH injections for over 4 months (I grew 1 inch). Now everyone in my batch is going to college, but I was afraid to face the world and decided to take 1 year drop. Well, my drop year is gonna end soon.

When my parents are angry they regret having me, they say it to me. It fking hurts. I cry but I know they love me.

There is no one I can share with, so here I am.

Life is difficult.

I originally posted this on** r/advice **but I need as much help and advice as I can get. Sorry if posts like these are not allowed in here, I just don't know where else I can ask. Please do read the whole thing for context.**

Hello. I am 17 female and I have a 12 year old younger brother.

Back in 2020 or early of 2021, my brother would sometimes, in a joking manner, tell me he wants to kill himself and that he attempted it before when he stood on the roof top and just ""felt it"". It was something he said very rarely though so apart from feeling a little anxious for a brief time, I'd eventually pass it off as a joke.

However, things changed a bit recently.

He randomly chimes in tells me that he wants to kill himself, however quite frequently. And this began quite recently, maybe since almost a week or two ago? Probably around the time his chest infection began or when my mom began to be more strict around him since he doesn't want to listen to her.

He one time randomly asked me ""do you know how many times I tried to kill himself?"" and when I tell him a random number (I said 12) he'd say ""How did you know?"".

Recently, he got a little sick. He says that his chest hurts like someone stabbed him, and mom took him to the doctor who prescribed him medicine and said it could be just an infection. However, he keeps putting the AC in his room on (which is something he always does even before getting sick) which was something mom and dad told him not to do. However, he kept doing it. And when I told him not to do it as it could make his condition worse, he shook his head and said that he wouldn't mind if he died cause he wants to.

He also told me that he's not going to actually do it and he promised. However he followed by saying that he has been ""having those thoughts though"" since he was 6 years old (which is...weird but also worrying the more I thin about it) because he's been feeling sad lately because both mom and dad ""bully"" him (which is not true. They are just strict with him sometimes when he doesn't listen to them and he interprets that as them picking on him). He also bring me into it sometimes, saying I take their side.

To describe the manner he says these comments on, he says it while chuckling, almost like awkward sort of chuckle. It's the kind of way where you feel awkward when you are admitting something, or when you are trying to say something that internally you feel ""cool"" about but also want to appear humble and awkward while saying it or that it's not something you are supposed to say to someone (hopefully this made sense? Even I don't know how to properly describe it. Maybe the first example is the best one).

Something in me tells me this is just a phase that kids those age goes through where they just make edgy comments and jokes because it makes them feel very ""cool"". Like, the way he says it and the way he is very open about it tells me that it *might* be a phase.

But at the same time every single time he says something like it, it worries me and trigger my anxiety (I have anxiety issues + I am very sensitive about topics regarding suicide and death). I am scared he'll actually do it. I urged him to talk to therapist and that I can possibly hook him up with my own, but he says no. He had even told me to not take him seriously. However, sometimes he'd say ""Like I actually feel like it this time"" and then also told me ""but don't take me too seriously"". What also increases my anxiety is that this is so all of a sudden. As in it's suspicious that he is saying this so frequently and, as far as I know, only to me. I am just scared that the ""What if...?"" thoughts in my mind are true.

I am someone who doesn't like to verbally and openly express my love and affection for someone, especially a family member, however, to be as brutally honest as I can, I do love my brother and I don't want to loose him. And if he dies I don't know how I will be able to live after that.

I am scared. Is this actually just a phase? What should I do? I don't want him to do it and I don't want to have ever failed in saving him if he actually does it. Any advice on how I can handle or deal with this situation?

\-

I also feel even worse because earlier today me, my mom, me and him were talking about how hand sanitizers were flammable and dangerous after seeing a video and I remember telling a story about this guy who poured hand sanitizer on his head which caught on fire after being tazered and he died. And only mere minutes after did I realize that my brother could attempt this if he is feeling suicidal and now I beating myself up because I should not have told him something like that."
queen_of_the_moths,2022-01-29 09:04:18+00:00,I'm shutting down,"The last year, especially the last seven months, have been an absolute nightmare. My depression is bad under the best of circumstances, but my life has become surreal. Homelessness, estrangement from my parents, loss of a loved one, friend having to leave me behind after suffering permanent brain damage, financial struggles, betrayal, illness, an upsetting diagnosis... It just goes on and on. 

I try every day to remember my best friend and all she's done for me. She's been right here with me through it all, despite being on the other side of the country. I also used to think about my pets when my thoughts got bad, but they aren't with me right now, and I have no idea if I'll ever get them back. I really don't want to hurt her, but every time I see a chance to improve my situation, it blows up in my face. It's like I'll never get out of this. I'm just so exhausted, and it feels like I'm only delaying the inevitable while suffering as much as possible. 

I'm a burden, and I know that for a fact. I know my best friend loves me, but this has all been a huge drain on her, both emotionally and financially. I feel like I'm constantly dragging her down with me, and I hate it so much. She matters so much to me, and I keep trying to rationalize that she'd be better off without me. I know she'd be sad, and maybe angry, if I gave in, but eventually she could move on and not have to worry about me anymore. 

It's funny, I've lost a lot of people who would be sad if I died. It's almost like the universe is telling me I'm free to do what I have to."
queen_of_the_moths,2022-01-29 08:54:23+00:00,"""You don't look depressed""","I was in the hospital several months ago (for physical stuff, not mental), and I was put on suicide watch. I'm a bubbly and friendly person by nature, which is hard for me to turn off, so most people probably wouldn't have guessed how bad I was doing.

An abrasive but well-intentioned nurse came in to give me my meds.  After a minute, she casually mentioned, ""Everyone is very worried about you.""

I didn't immediately understand, so I asked her what she meant. She says in an incredulous tone, like they were all idiots, ""They think you're suicidal.""

I told her that I actually have major depressive disorder, and I was incredibly depressed lately. She looked at me and, you guessed it, said, ""You don't look depressed.""

I told her, ""People don't 'look' depressed. It's internal. Depression is an illness, and a lot of people mistake it for a mood.""

She thought about it for a moment, then told me about her daughter who struggles with depression and how frustrated she is that she ""can't help her."" It led to a good conversation, actually, and I tried to help her better communicate with her daughter and offered ways she could approach it with sensitivity. She was really appreciative, rather than defensive, so I hope she and her daughter are able to come to a better understanding of each other.

All of this long ramble is to say, people sure do like to jump to conclusions. It just felt like I was in a PSA for a minute there. I try to be as honest as possible with people so that they can see that depression has many faces. I wish we had a better understanding of mental illness in society.

&amp;#x200B;

 

**\*\*Mildly amusing continuation of that anecdote\*\*** 

While I was admitted, I had my gaming laptop with me so I could work on video editing and writing while I was there. That same nurse asked if I was a gamer, and when I told her I was, she was shocked. ""You don't look like a gamer."" I laughed and asked her what a gamer looked like.

""Gloomy, pasty, disheveled. Male."" 

I explained to her that that's just an old stereotype and games are very mainstream these days. All sorts of people play them.

She didn't look convinced, but acknowledged that she had limited experience with gamers. There was even a third, less egregious assumption later. It was actually kind of funny."
Sure_Gap_9727,2022-01-29 08:47:30+00:00,Psychiatry hospital experience,"Last year I was put in a psychiatry hospital because i tried killing myself. It was my choice to go in there, i thought it would make me feel better, that i wouldn't have to think about these thoughts, but after 3 months of being swallowed by medicine, it simply didn't work. After that i just kept having those memories of being in there, being surrounded by people that were drug addicts to 16 year olds who raped their mother. 
In there, there were many people like me. Looks like I'm not different from other people by any means.
It was truly the worst experience of my life, even though I'm only 15. (birthday yesterday)
I don't think I am a crazy person. I am in fact mentally illed but that is nothing compared to those people.

I guess we could say it was a trauma and all, but to avoid it i just do things I like. Watching tv shows, movies, playing videogames, things like that.

And sometimes i feel like i might have to go there again, because i wonder how my parents or family would feel like if i died. I worry about them. I don't want them to be sad because of a mistake i did. 
So I think it might be better for everyone if i just go back there.
The thing is that i just also won't tell them about those things.

I was a chatty ball of fire when I was a kid; I laughed too loud and I smiled at strangers and asked questions out of curiosity. I got quiet at some point in my early teens, I stopped smiling without a reason and I stopped asking questions because I lacked a desire to know the answers. I’m in my twenties now and have lived through a great deal of despair for someone so young…and as of this past year I had the realization that I haven’t been living for myself for the last eight years of my life. I’ve managed to get by for the sake of other people that I feel care enough to be harmed by my passing. I was okay with this for a long time, justified it because at least it kept alive but now that I have acknowledged how long it has been, I can’t ignore that it’s a flawed way to go about life. It started out as living for my parents, then it turned into living for close friends, and in moments where I felt I had no one to live for I chose to tell myself I would stay alive for my future partner no matter who and where they were, I told myself to hold on for that unknown person—and it worked, I have managed to press on. Right now I am not living for anyone but my sister; you see recently someone once very close to her commit suicide. This death was the first big personal loss my sister has ever faced and I can’t put her through that again. my sister and I don’t get along very well (don’t speak as much as we should but when we do we disagree) but I can wholeheartedly say she is the only reason I’m holding on lately. I’m thankful to have people to live for but I wish I felt capable of living just for myself. I don’t know if I trust myself enough to do that though."

The restrictions will be in place forever and ever. What’s the point in celebrating my birthday during this era? We’re all gonna get it and probably get it again. It’s over… 

I believe it’s the end of the line soon for me…"

stupidbot8444,2022-01-29 08:01:46+00:00,Need advice," 

I always wanted to find a label for myself so that I could fit in more easily with other people and labelling oneself seems like a big thing nowadays but no matter how much I try, I can't seem to find one for myself. I tried taking an MBTI test but my results keep changing from time to time. I guess a major reason why it happens is because I can't seem to find the perfect answer for myself. It almost feels like I can't express anything about myself and I feel so confused yet at the same time I feel like I know the answers but I am making it more complex on purpose.

This is a problem I have often. I don't know if it's because I overthink or if it's because of how I view the world. Ever since I was young I always found it really easy to understand certain patterns. For example I do pretty well at school as I seem to know how to answer the questions asked as if I have discovered a pattern in how all questions are supposed to be answered. I also felt like I understood things on a deeper level than others did (not things related to emotions, I am trying to be more empathetic). So it feels as though I know how I am supposed to be based on what the internet and media taught me to be.

I am sure I am not the only one who experiences it. We all seem to know how to react in different situations like what to say when someone you know is upset and what to do when you are scared. Like I would put my head against the window of my car just how the main character does in the movies. I seem to know what to write and what to say and how to behave but sometimes it feels limiting to know all this already because I feel like I can't express myself genuinely and I think that's why I want to label myself.

But here's something I have realised and that is that the human personality cannot be expressed completely by labels as it is much more complex than that. In most of the movies, the ""quirky"" girl only behaves in a quirky manner and doesn't seem to be able to behave in a different way. These movies are generally the ones we are exposed to when we are young and the characters seem to have this really strong personality which isn't flexible at all.

I would like to mention something I read. In gone girl there is a part where the author mentions feeling as though people were no longer genuine and that they were living off a script. She mentioned feeling bored because it felt like there was nothing more to be discovered as we had already been exposed to it through media and the Internet.

So this is kind of what I feel. I was always a really active kid and when I was younger my family would take me to meet their friends and I would bond with their children. But then due to some problems they stopped taking me out. I was in my room all the time and as I didn't have any siblings or friends who lived near my house, it was torturous. It felt like I couldn't breathe because we would never go out and at home I had no one to talk to and not to mention all the fights that used to take place.

And so I started daydreaming and romanticizing my life in order to not be miserable all the time. It was great and I still daydream frequently but sometimes I feel like that might be a reason why I can't seem to know myself that well. I don't know it's just really confusing to me. Please tell me you understand what I am saying.

CryptographerMoist48,2022-01-29 06:36:48+00:00,Yea. There's no use of me finding work anymore,"Just fuck everything at this point. Really. 

Yesterday morning the Optometrist and vision manager told me that they don't want me to be in vision center. 

They are now aware of my learning disability, WEREN'T even open to possibility filling out an accommodation  for additional training. 

Instead they want me to be greeting or being a personal shopper. Walmart mainly wants greeting to be for people who have disabilities, ( do I honestly look reta*rded to these people) which was never a problem until now.  BTW greeters literally make $10 an hour which no one can't live off of. 

What's even the point of me being a personal shopper anyways, ur literally putting crap in a bag and in baskets (a literal child can do this job) at the end of the day I'm gonna hate it anyways


I might as well just give up and get kicked out of my apartment. 

At this point no one can help me."

I wish I could be the type of girl to go out alone but the current state of the world is too scary. I try to put my focus elsewhere but no luck. I tell myself that as I get older and remain alone and have nothing to live for I'll give going out alone a chance but till then my heart will continue to hurt.

Appa_999,2022-01-28 23:26:37+00:00,I’m tired of be tired,"Every day I feel completely and utterly lonely, which results in me going out of my way to be alone. When I have my high days(which is usually a day or so) I actually try to change my mindset and situation, but the low days seem to go on longer and longer. I know I have people that will listen to me, but I have this voice that tells me it’s all just fake concern. Then I just seem to sink lower and lower. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t know how to maintain relationships of any kind. When ever I do find someone who will listen, I find any reason to distance myself from them because I either realize they don’t really care or I convince myself that’s the case.

I know to my self I want friends, an actual social life, but deep down for some reason I feel like I don’t deserve to have anything except these overwhelming feelings of loneliness and self hate. And more than anything I wish I could find someone or something to help deal with this. It’s like I’m completely incapable of being happy or even letting the idea of happiness set in."
dbhsimp,2022-01-28 23:19:54+00:00,No close friends,"So I used to have this really great close friend that made me so happy, but now that she’s gone (long story), I haven’t been able to make another close friend since. Just someone that I can tell anything, doesn’t judge me, I can invite to anything, etc. The friends that I do have aren’t that great because they “don’t like getting very close to people” like come on. Believe me I’m trying to make new friends but it’s hard with COVID because I have only one class in person and I don’t even get the chance to talk to anyone. I’m more upset about this as of late though because my birthday is in one week and I can think of no one I actually want to spend it with. I was just going to walk around Seattle but I can’t even do that without a friend (because I’m 17 and it’s not that safe). And I sure as hell don’t want to walk around with my parents because as much as I love them, I want to be young for a day and not worry about them monitoring me. Looks like I’m spending the day alone and going somewhere less fun."

There are so many things that are pulling me down, but one small innocent comment/joke from my husband has plummeted me down a deep dark pit. This pebble I laughed off minutes ago, now has scratched the last finger I was hanging on by over this pit. Now I'm falling and nothing matters. This mental selfishness I call depression consuming me. Taking my meds, my dog's needs ( which I only have because of said depression), my son's needs, my needs, fu*k it all. How can I be this selfish, my logic says. Get over it, my logic says. It's not that bad, my logic says. Depression has won. I've fought so much, but depression fought harder. The doubts creep in, they consume me. I am alone. No one cares. I am not important. Logic disagrees. Do not put your self worth, your self esteem, on anyone or anything but yourself. I look up as I'm falling to Logic, I scream ""Fu*king HOW?! YOU THINK I'D BE HERE IF I COULD DO THAT?!"" Logic is getting smaller as I fall into this pit. I reach knowing there will be nothing to grab. On the Earth in this body I sit quietly, to do otherwise, to fall apart on the outside as I am inside to bring the ones I love most into this hell?! I could not, I cannot, I would not. I can't control much, but the outside that everyone sees? This body with repress it, it will be numb- I tell this to my mind and body. You a bad bi*ch. You are the sh*t. Okay I think this, why doesn't it work on this mental pit I'm falling down. G*d da*n it, work, bi*ch, WORK!!!!!!!! I ain't got time for this!!! Epic failure. Just how I feel. Useless, hopeless, loneliness, despair, regret, selfishness, disappointed, unloved, unwanted, entitled, hypocrite...THIS IS ME. Logic: no. Depression: Everything is a lie. A voice: Get validation somehow. Also money fixes everything.
Logic screaming: EVERYTHING/ONE JUST STOP!!!!!
Another voice: Don't become like those users, don't become the assh*les you hate. Me in the pit: HOW?!

stupidbot8444,2022-01-28 04:57:41+00:00,Confused &amp; Lost,"Hey, this is my first time posting something somewhere. I really need to get this off my chest in one way or the other and as I don't have any friends or really anyone to talk to, I might as well try posting this.

So a little bit about me. I am 15 and my life has changed a lot since the last year. I have been forced to rethink all that I know and the things I used to help myself cope with reality don't seem to work anymore. I have lost all motivation to keep existing. I also lost all the friends I had so it has been really lonely. Not only that I was tortured by certain things going on in my life and its still happening. Its not as bad as it was sometime ago but nonetheless its still here.

I am someone who blindly trusts people and this always gives other people a chance to bring me down. I never knew how to set boundaries and didn't understand why they were even needed in the first place. I am not sure if I am an empath but it has always been really hard for me to cut off people from my life but certain things pushed me to set boundaries and cut some people off. I still haven't been able to remove them from my life completely but I really wish I could. 

Actually the thought of doing that scares me even though I know that's what I need to do. So yeah its been a big change from being someone who was so naive and gullible to someone who is in a situation in which I need to distance myself from people, I feel like I don't know myself anymore. I have been forced to reconsider everything I knew and loved once. And in a way I am thankful I learnt my lesson but it doesn't change the fact that I am in the middle of changing into a completely new person and for the time being I am no one.

Its like I have to start from 0 and do everything all over again. Sometimes I don't want to exist but at the same time I am scared of missing out on life. Its funny how I use the word life so often yet I can't seem to understand what it is or why it is. I feel so much better just writing this here and knowing that someone will read and to a point understand what I am going through.

 That's all I have to say. Thank you for reading this."
coffeeandwifiguy,2022-01-28 04:54:52+00:00,Where am I going in life?,"I don't really know where to start... throughout my life I hadn't really known how to cope with just about everything nowadays. I'm broke, out of work staying with really amazing friends who were willing to take me in and help me and no matter how grateful I am for that I have no clue how I can be better. How I can do better. I've tried everything... and maybe I do deserve it; I've made my mistakes. Terrible ones. Hurt good people, done good things for shitty people too. And the worst part is I will never be able to see myself happy again. Not after everything that's happened. People think I'm happy/enjoying life but I'm not, I'm struggling. I don't want people to worry about me, I worry more about myself let alone knowing others are distraught about me. I want to be happy, I just don't know how..."
sadpinkgirl,2022-01-28 04:18:41+00:00,I hate myself so fkin much,"My boyfriend is the worse. He’s constantly ignoring my depression and I’ve been with him for 3 years. He never cares about my sadness or my suicidal thoughts he just makes me feel even more bad about myself instead. Every single fucking time. I’m honestly so sick of it nd I wish I would of knew what real love Felt like I wish I knew what having a real boyfriend felt like, a boyfriend who doesn’t get mad at you when you tell them you want to die and kill your self. A boyfriend who actually cares and comforts you instead of saying you need therapy and constantly continuing to be mean to me making me feel even more worthless than I already do. I stopped loving myself entirely when I got with him because he never showed me I was anyone or anything important he only complains about my existence plus the sex is really bad. He doesn’t care about me at all In bed. Not even a little bit. He literally never cares about my feelings. at this point I just want to kill myself even more. I know you’re all wondering why I’m still with him and why can’t I just leave and move on. 

I have my own place and I’m independent so it wouldn’t be hard. The only issue I have here is I have nobody to keep me safe if I left he would stalk me nobody cares about Me. I don’t want to go to court and get a restraining order I don’t have the energy for that I’m way too depressed. The only thing.. I just wish I wasn’t so mentally weak and afraid of being alone to the point where I stay with a horrible human being who doesn’t give a fuck about me bc I gave up on being loved by anyone on this planet.. I wish I was mentally strong enough to ghost him and just disappear but it’s so hard and I hate that about myself. I hate myself so much."
RegurgitatedEnzymes,2022-01-28 03:03:34+00:00,I feel at fault for not finding work,"I have been trying my damned hardest since October to find another job. I left my last job back in April, in the midst of April, due to being overworked and walked allover by my employer(s). I was working 70-80 hours a week. While other coworkers left as they pleased and got away with misconduct because my manager liked them. Because I quit I had to move back home (I had moved an hour into the city from my rural-suburban hometown). I took a break from working for a while after that and have since been trying to, ""get back in the game,"" to no avail. I've been stood by interviewing managers a few times now and have gotten very little responses from other places I currently apply to. Admittedly to some degree my options are a bit limited. I've only worked in retail and I don't have the patience for fast food. I don't have a college degree and I don't have a car, though I'm working on getting one. It's strange that I can't seem to find work, despite the current climate. I hear all this stuff about the ""great resignation,"" and ""employers are desperate."" Which has been going on since like September. But I can't seem to find a place that'll actually hire me. I will say I do live in the outskirts of America. So all there is is factory work and manual labor jobs. That and there's practically zero public transport. Somehow I've been feeling responsible for my predicament. Mainly because I have an anniversary coming up as well as a family member's birthday. So I feel guilty that I'm broke up. That and somehow my family and other people act as if I'm not trying to find a job. Despite taking me for interviews and other stuff. So it confuses me. Members of this country do the same as well; I've witnessed it online especially. This country tries to blame people for things they aren't in control of. An employer can deny somebody a job purely because it's a rainy day and they don't feel like ""suffering"" through an interview. Not to mention the underhanded misdealings conducted by hiring managers. Perhaps the shirt you wore to your interview was too red or they just don't like you. You can be denied survival purely on the whim of a narcissist. Maybe I'm wrong but it sure seems that way. Sorry for the long ramble. I'd just like some advice. Some ""cheatcodes"" perhaps to maybe help my advancement of finding a job. I thank you all."

Wether that be going outside, eating, or doing the little things for myself. I don’t live an interesting life and I don’t do much. I always feel very empty and sad. I’ve been through a lot in my life and I never stop going through things. I deal with depression and anxiety as well. I never feel the need to do the little things for myself anymore or find joy in anything. I always feel like if I keep taking care of myself and trying to find happiness one day something bad will happen to me again and I will be back to feeling depressed again. Anytime I’m actually in a happy time in my life or something good happens to me I think to myself how long is this happiness going to last? It’s caused me to be a really emotionless person and nothing really excites me anymore. I’m only 19, I graduated high school last year and I don’t have a plan for my future because I constantly feel like this. I truly believe I deserve good things but how do I stop feeling this way?"

Odd_Finance5326,2022-01-28 00:48:28+00:00,Tired,"I have struggled a lot with my confidence for the first past few years, I’m only 17 and sometimes it just get to me I started and new job in the summer  holidays last year and at first it was nice to have something to do instead of sitting in my bed feeling bad for myself, I made some friends at work and it was going good till about 1 month ago where I fell back into that depression again and I don’t feel like I want to leave my bed I also have college in the week the only days I do get off I’m spent doing college work or nothing enjoyable, my new college has been tiring cause I have friends but not close I never really have had a friend I can talk to about my problem’s like I’m in a group of three people and these two girls are closer even though we have all know each other for the same amount of time I guess it just makes me feel sad when there close hugging etc and I feel left out like I always have, it’s like they do include me in things but it just doesn’t feel right I will sometimes just be with one of them on their own and we just sit in this like awkward silence and barely even talk unless it’s about class work or classes that we have, it was the same in secondary school (high school) I had a group of friends and there was seven of us and I never really felt close with them either not enough to share stuff with them then eventually when our group got smaller and some of us didn’t speak but I did with one of the girls and we were close for a while until college (before I moved College to the one I am in now), when we got split up into different classes even though we signed up for the same course she became close with this girl and when we would sit together at lunch she would bring her too and I just never feel good about myself cause people in think are close to me leave me all the time or get new best mates and we were close like we did everything together we even walked to college the day it started together, then we fell out and things haven’t been the same since especially me moving college which I needed to do for my health now I’m seeing her posting pictures with this girl all the time and it’s the same with the two girls in my new college they will take pictures together in class while I’m sitting on there table and will leave me to myself.

Also going back to my job a month ago I was close with this girl cause I’d get the bus too my new college with her, and of course there happened to be a new employee that we have shifts with on the weekend and they get close since there both eighteen they got out clubbing together and drink together I feel like when I’m eighteen she will probably not invite me out for drinks, basically the whole vibe at work has changed cause the people that are similar age range as me from about 17/20 years old I worked with before the new girl came along we got along we would talk after serving customers but now they just talk to her, also my break time has changed and they gave her my break time ,although it not a big deal I just feel so put out like I’m never going to have a good close friend.
Also don’t even get me started on the stress the college is putting on me to pass English otherwise next year I can’t do the course that I enjoy.

I’m also feeling jealous cause of my younger sister who is starting college this year, she is so smart and I’m just dumb like all the marks she is getting in her tests I didn’t get half of when I was in school I barely passed any classes and got 2’s and she is here getting 7’s, also new insecurity unlocked she has a boyfriend and I have never had one that Ioved me as much as hers does.

I know that this rant is stupid but it’s been keeping me up at night every night thinking about these things I just don’t get why no one likes me long enough and why I keep losing all these people."
LilEggy111,2022-01-28 00:30:46+00:00,Unsure about by future ⚠️ brief discussion about human bite marks,"I started as an Behavioral technician then became an Registered behavioral therapist over a year ago. The company I use to provide services with never put me with majorly aggressive children (those who bite, punch, pull hair, etc.) as they didn’t have the means to train most therapists to deal with those behaviors.
I’m just now starting with a company, at a clinic, that does treat those behaviors (which I knew prior to signing on with them). However, I was promised to receive defensive training prior to treating a client exhibiting those behaviors. 
Recently I was providing therapy for a client who had been exhibiting biting and head butting behavior starting in December (a whole month before I signed with the company) and I was bitten before I had the chance to finish reading their Behavior intervention plans. The first few bites weren’t so bad but the final bite broke through the skin in several places which caused bleeding. Currently my whole arm is very painful and badly bruised. 
I had the chance to talk to my supervisor and they claimed it was a mistake that it will not happen again, however, I’m not scheduled to complete aggressive behavior training until late February and am not completely convinced it won’t happen again. 
Regardless I understand mistakes happen. I have no grudges against anyone involved but I’ve been extremely anxious and depressed since the incident. I thought being an RBT was amazing before but now I’m dreading going into work, feeling sad about my future, and start crying anytime I talk about the incident.
I’ve been thinking about quitting as I graduate with my psychology bachelors in May but I have no idea what direction I’d head into after.
If anyone has insight or advice I’d really appreciate it. Thank you in advance."

I've always been a good student. Not a straight A type of student but I was always top of the class, say top 10 and when I needed good results (math Olympics or contest for example, my Cambridge exam and such) I was always able to grind hard in the weeks prior to squeeze out a very good result (say, top 3).

Well I got into med school (I'm in second year now) and all that motivation to just do well disappeared. 

I used to play the piano, and paint and read and I was quite athletic and I just enjoyed life. My self esteem both physically and mentally were good. 

It's my first semester of on-site exams (last year because of covid it was all online and I kinda slacked off, mostly cheated on my exams) and I feel overwhelmed. I realized that since I moved into this new town by myself I became a parasite. Sleeping all day long, through the online courses, stopped eating well, gained about 10 kg. Stopped painting reading studying... Everything. My self esteem went down, I considered myself quite attractive and now I struggle to go out with friends because I never seem to find an outfit that doesn't look fat (I used to have 45 kg, I'm 55 kg now and as a female I feel like my slim figure was my best asset).

Question is: how the Hell do I get back on track? I tried forcing myself to go back to normal, I tried going to a psychologist, I'm not diagnosed with depression or ADHD... I feel like I can't focus on anything and I lack energy for the smallest tasks. 

Any tips would be more than welcome. 

Thanks."

I try to talk to my mum and she doesn't want to know and shouts at me like I should act a certain way to not anger dad when he provokes me and to stay on his good side for money, I'm being blackmailed. They don't care how I feel and they think I should get a grip and not be depressed when they're the ones making me depressed, I'm even neglecting myself. I depend on them and I hope to get a job because I feel trapped and living in a toxic environment, my only way is to stay out the house as much as I can."

United-Effort-8145,2022-01-26 23:22:04+00:00,Depressed but my best friend thinks i exaggerate,"A few weeks ago i was on a party of a friend of mine and i started talking to my best friend. We just talked and we got to the subject of my depression. I told him a few weeks before that i almost took all my HDHD medication to try and kill myself. I was drunk when i told him and it got to him wrong. He thought i told him i took all my meds. 
I thought the day after i might have told him the wrong way and i got scared he would think that i lied and wanted attention. When i was at this party he brought it up again and said
 “you lied about your suicide attempt because you would have been in the hospital if you did take all of your meds” and he would not let me explain how it actually went. When that happend everything just became black and i could not see nor hear anything. I just remember saying i am going to go home and repeated that over and over again. After that i got on my bike and went to a highway and almost stepped in front of a car. After walking across  the road a few times i called the suïcide prevention line. And the woman on the phone calmed me down a bit. A little later a different friend came by and sat down with me and then brought me home. 

Skip to a few weeks later and i speak to my best friend again and he said i exaggerate about everything (he was talking about that party). He just does not understand he said the one thing i was the most scared about. And panicked really bad. I did not know what to do and now i am scared i fucked up my friendship. 

Now i am trying to hide it from him and he thinks i might be bipolar just because i laugh sometimes. And thinks that means a person is happy. 
I don’t know what to do anymore and i am scared i will fuck everything up. 

Does anyone have some advise for me because i am stuck in my own thoughts."

Please no bs, love, your plain irrationals","Long  story short: I was a regular guy with a regular poor shitty childhood  and I inherited more money then I ever imagined it was possible someone I  knew could have, it's money to live a life of lavishness and never have  to worry about anything.

I did  spend a lot in one year in a hedonistic fashion, traveled the world and  everything you can imagine. The end result was the same, what I already  knew, for me (in my case) the money doesn't change a single dam thing.

I  am not depressed (during that one year I visited top psychiatrist,  psychologists and top people in their field, and almost all of them said  the same, that no I was not depressed but that I should do CBT, which I  did and follow to a T, it changed nothing).

I  have set up my suicide in Switzerland and my body will be sent back to  my country, the money will be given partially to my family and the rest  to a couple of charities and research centers that I've vetted.

The  reasons didn't change, before I didn't had money to kill myself in  Switzerland, but I was going to kill myself anyway; I think if anything  the money showed me that I was right all along in my resolve.

I  am not angry, I am not doing this out of spite, there is no big  problem, life is not a burden that I can't bear, it's none of that, it's  just a felling of why? why should I do all of this? I think we have a  irrational bias towards life, and that's why we carry on.

That's why I can't make any friends. When I joined Facebook, I drew a picture of all my friends to show my appreciation for their friendship, but the drawing was horrible, so they unfriended me because of that. Therefore, I hide without making any single friend for fear of being judged. I'm the most useless, incompetent, awkward, clumsy and disastrous person in the world.

I know I'm stupid. If I am , I just want my friends to tell me that I'm stupid , then , I feel like I would be able to cope with this anguish and agony I'm feeling. WHY AM I SO STUPID. I can't do this anymore. I'm still in middle school and I'm failing ? I'm sure that I'll fail life and end up becoming a slime of nothing , or a homeless , workless , cheapskate. 

I wish I was creative , or smart. Something that I can be proud of , something that my parents could be proud of. Everyone is so much more better at everything than me. I can't keep on acting bluff.

Not depressed.

If  this is not the place sorry and please point me to the right subs, but I  am looking for perspective, so maybe it's a good place?

Hello there.

Background:   I have everything society deems desirable and what I don't have could   quiet easily be achieved. I am good looking, young, healthy and I was   the sole inherent of a fortune, but I don't have much use for it. And   have decided on suicide.

I had a   regular childhood, my interests and habits may have drawn me to   different subjects and situations but it was pretty standard, my family   was poor (we always lived in rented houses, I never went hungry, never   had to sell substances or steal to live by, poor but poor as I believe  most  people are), father was a shitty father (but not a psychopath,  just a  ignorant, arrogant person that grew up in a worst environment  and a  worst time than me), mother pretty much the same, but ""warmer"" to  her  children (as mother's typically are, I believe).

Up   to 15 I was ""extrovert"" I was always congratulated in my oratory and   called charismatic by both teachers staff and others, and also   congratulated on my leadership, then I started to self study philosophy   and try to see behind the scenes of politics, and ""reality"", so I   started deconstructing a lot of my own thoughts and actions, why did I   reacted a certain way and what not. From 15 onward, I no longer was this   ""extrovert"", not because I couldn't but because I didn't wanted to,   partially because all of that was a ""want for attention"" in a way, a   form of boosting my own ego (or at least that's how I saw it at the   time), a way to avoid being alone, I reflected so much on myself, I   always did those deconstructions and had a interest in psychology from a   very young age 8, 9; mainly I think as an attempt to understand   father's behavior; But regardless of the why I grew to like my own   company and appreciate silence.

Anyway,   as I grew up I saw that money was just another thing that I could   deconstruct, and due to the position that I was in, I was able to do   that, so I made some money with speculation so that I wouldn't have to   work for one or two years, during that time I did a lot of things I   wanted and didn't have to worry about money, but that was that, there   was no big revelation, I think this is another illusion in society, a   time ""alone"" or a vacation is nice, and sometimes useful, necessary, but   if you have the means and let it, it  will became just another   distraction another way to live life, running from your problems or just   living in the noise.

Then this   fortune came, and I dissected some more of my beliefs I gave things   chances (I did things that I wanted, things that I didn't wanted and   things that I wouldn't do it), I traveled, I had lots of sex, dated,   other countries, scuba dived in coral reeves, did different substances  to try  them out, made friends in person, traveled with some of them.  And the  conclusion was the same, although you can live only like that,  only  doing those things, that would be like a professional gamer or a  person  that plays video games all day, it looses it's magic, and even  if you do  different things so that you won't get tired of it, or bored,  it's just  a distraction. And don't think that I did those activities  with the  mentality that I would not enjoy and already knew the results;  No! I  really gave it a try, and it was great!  But that's it when it's  over,  it's over.

Yes I have  seeked  medical attention, by the best professionals in the world (only  in  Germany I visited 4 different psychiatrists and 3 psychologists),  after I  received this fortune I spent 11 months going from doctor to  doctor  most doctors from the US almost all of them said that I was not   depressed, and recommended CBT (which I did and follow the instruction   to a T), it changed nothing, I found one researcher that understands   exactly how I think, but I want to share this one last time and see if   anyone has a new perspective on the topic. A while ago I posted a post   here, but I didn't expressed myself well, and I left some parts out   (well it's impossible to express yourself and your thinking in a post),   but anyway, I removed the old post and created this, I hope that this   one express better how I feel and what I feel.

I   just don't want to work for things and do things, (now this is the   tricky part), when I say that I don't want to work for things and that I   don't want to do things, it's not that is difficult, or that I have to   drag myself to do something, it's just that I don't see why I should,   besides the obvious reasons there is no reason, for instance, when I   wake up I go and shower and brush my teeth, then prepare breakfast, it's   normal, but in a intellectual level I don't think it's needed, it's   difficult to explain, but it's not the same as being depressed. I   learned so much in the past and I know I could learn much more and that   in a individual level our actions affect this micro cosmos, but I just   don't see why I have to do it. Before the money I was already set on   killing myself, it's not anger, it's not despair, it's not depression,   you may say that it's apathy I could agree with that I don't know how to   really put it into words; I don't think there is something to be fixed   in this case because there is nothing broken. I am ok with my  decision,  as I said in my deleted post, I think the repulsion to death  is a  irrational bias, like an emotion, we don't like dissecting and  thinking  critically about it, and some are so emotional about it that  they  literally can't.

But I also know that maybe there is something that I am missing, so I made this post.  
When   I was in Germany there was this show that the brother of the girl I   dated was watching (we ended it up watching) called The Queen's Play   about a chess grandmaster, that after she achieves her title she falls   into depression and starts drinking a lot, and she only sees chess,   chess is everything for her, I empathize in a way with the character,   not in the depression but in this feeling on there is nothing to do.   Again, don't get me wrong, our planet is gigantic, and the universe much   more vast than any human can imagine, and I could spend my whole life   studying just a tiny portion of a field in Mathematics and it would not   even scratch that niche, but there is this feeling that it's all a   distraction, to put it bluntly is a feeling of ""is this it?"" .

Again this is difficult to describe, but this was the best I could.

My   family won't see my dead body right after it, it will be done in   Switzerland, then shipped to my country, I will go out in my own terms   peacefully, and my family will be taken care of, the rest of the money   will be donated to some charities that I've vetted.

Please   for those that do comment, don't recommend medical assistance, nor  talk  about love or causing hurt to those close to me.  And no, this is  NOT a  post encouraging suicide, I am only trying to share my thoughts  and  reflect on the topic, because I do understand the implications and   ramifications of it, this was not a decision made lightly."

I was sexually abused when I was young, and it made me depressed, anxious, and fearful of others ever since. I'm pushing thirty and I have yet to genuinely connect with anyone. I've never been in a relationship, been kissed, had sex, all due to my mental illness or how I look.

Yesterday I had to quit therapy due to the cost and I lost my insurance the beginning of the year. I feel like however long I have left will be nothing but loneliness and dealing with these horrific thoughts constantly. All I ever wanted was to feel close to someone. To start a family and give my kids the childhood I didn't have. I feel like that's hopeless now.

A few months ago I took a new job that ended up being a terrible career move for myself. I work in an incredibly competitive field, so it isn't like I can easily find a new job or anything. But since taking this job, my mental health has gone down faster than the Titanic.

I've enrolled in classes to try and change my career into something I'll enjoy more, but the stress from the classes is just too much for me and I'm considering dropping out. But I know if I do that, I'll disappoint a lot of people, including myself, but it isn't like it would be the first time.

I've been working all day and have class tonight, but I really just want to go home and go to bed and cry. I don't want to text my friends or my girlfriend about how I'm feeling because I don't want to be a burden and I don't know what to say anyways. I'm on medication and am in therapy and have been for years, but it doesn't seem like it's ever really worked.

It’s a flexible schedule. But I find it so hard in between the bed days and the schedules. 

Skipped badminton again this month. And missed yoga yesterday due to a very important meeting. I’m in court for reasons outside of work. It involves “family”.
Reading is slipping away again and exercise. 

I have to create content today for work. And also do my hair. Polish myself up. I haven’t washed properly in 2 days. 
Pick up cat food. Tidy around the flat - it’s not that messy. It’s been worse. 

Loosing track of my bills. And running out of home necessities. 
And not forgetting email replies. 

Why can’t I just do it. 
Sometimes I feel myself getting better. I feel myself fighting through. And even start to enjoy the activities. 
Other days like today. It’s like iv been kicked at the knees, fallen and can’t get up. 

I’m losing weight rapidly and I can feel myself getting sick. Which I don’t have the capacity to allow because then I will truly be stuck in my life. I will lose everything. 
And I know people do get sick and need time to rest and heal. 
But I’m saying this because I am under the microscope right now. My sickness will be used against me. 

I miss my ex “friend” they don’t know how much they were motivating me to keep going. Having them around put a spring in my step. 

Will try get some rest and see how I feel when I wake up. I hope better."

I want to someday have kids with a woman I love, and to raise our kids with the very love and care that I wish my parents had shown me. However, I have been severely depressed for years, and this has impacted my love life equally as severely. I'm not unattractive physically, but I'm not the type of person who easily masks depression. One of the girls I dated even told me I always look sad, even when I'm smiling. I am afraid that I am unlovable, but without love I feel like there is no point in my continued living, that I am nothing. The longer I remain single, however, the more that seems to be the case. Were it not for my looks, nobody would give me a chance and I would assume already that love is entirely impossible for me, and surely would have killed myself by now. However, my history says I don't really make a good partner, and where I live there are hardly any ""fish"", so I feel simultaneously as though life is passing me by and that I'm not good enough to ever be loved by someone genuinely. I can hardly remember the rest of my 20s. I am torn. I know, logically, there's still hope left, but emotionally I am worn out. I hate knowing that my personality is the reason I'm alone. I'm like a sad porcupine; liable to hurt anyone who gets close and too emotionally draining to even bother. I used to medicate with weed and alcohol, which made me fun and outgoing, easy to talk to, even despite my depression. Those days are gone. Weed makes me psychotic and alcohol makes me unable to suppress the depression, so I do my best to avoid them, though sometimes I forget and slip up. Last I drank, it was at a going away party for a friend who was leaving town, and I became super depressed to the point that I left early so as not to ruin the night for others. I wish the pain would end. I wish I could be the outgoing person I used to be. I wish I was in love with somebody who also loved me, to make the struggle worth it. But what am I struggling for now? The idea that someday, years down the line, I won't be so pathetic and I'll be able to date again? I don't even know how to date. Who would ever give someone like me a chance at 29 or 30? The only reason anyone ever dated me to begin with is because they wanted to have sex. The fact is, I'm unlovable."

I cannot afford therapy and whenever I want to call up a suicide prevention line I begin to think that I am not even worth saving.

I looked in the mirror at it and the side of my tongue was pure white like a dead skin. I started to bite the base of my thumb until I can't anymore from the pain. I don't have the guts to kill myself. But I don't know if that is a good thing or not.

I feel like I am never good enough. I have been told that I am focusing on the bad stuff in my head but even though that I am aware of that why I keep thinking like that? I help people out in my daily life because of my line of work but I feel nothing. I get pats on the back for doing a good job but I only feel like I am a dead weight. I started to feel angry because I cannot feel anything but being a downer and be miserable. I get mad over little things and I am aware that they are little things and try to calm myself down by breathing deeply. My heart pounds for a while and when I am calm I feel exhausted and sad.

Recently I've been binge eating and smoking weed since I can't seem to cope with my binge eating, I know smoking/anxiety is what is causing this binge eating. This eating has caused me to gain weight (I'm 15, 5'3, 215.4 Ibs). I am sitting here writing this because maybe there are others like me struggling with the same thing. I now have no pants that fit me, I don't know how to stop my binge eating let alone the smoking which I know is a horrible thing to do. I just don't know what to do. I've also noticed it's harder for me to loose weight. I can't go anywhere without worrying if I look too fat. Worrying about that makes my anxiety spike up. Which leads me to…you guessed it binge eating. I just don't know what to do I've been contemplating harming myself or worse (things i won't get into). I guess this is a cry for help because my depression is spiraling. I have a therapist but I only ever get to see her every other week and currently I haven't seen her since December. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm unhappy with everything about myself.

He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot appeared to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long age been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch. Ugly would have been a dark grey tabby, striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction. ""That's one UGLY cat!!"" All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their homes, or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave. Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running, meowing frantically and bump his head against their hands, begging for their love. If you ever picked him, up he would immediately begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find. One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbor's huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his screams, and I tried to rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an end. Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home, I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. It must be hurting him terribly, I thought. Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear. Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously dying, was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye toward me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps some compassion. At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. Ugly died in my arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterward, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful.  He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for. Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always try to be Ugly."
Minimum_Current_481,2022-01-24 10:45:26+00:00,I feel ashamed of myself advice would be nice,"Hi,

I'm nearly 24 (f) and don't have a career or a full time job I find it hard to go to interviews I get ill regularly, don't have friends my boyfriend left me due to no progression. I feel completely alone and confused. I can bearly socialize and feel ashamed cause of it. What's worse is my parents want me to go far in life but I just don't believe I can due to low self esteem. I didn't pass my maths GCSE and most jobs need this I tried doing the exam over and over again but couldn't pass it and now hate the subject. Also, I don't have confidence to get my driver's license either I tried doing some lessons but because of how much it costs I couldn't continue with my lessons and feel like a failure cause of it. 

I can't take it no more I feel drained and don't want to continue with life.

Reading this back makes me really sad because I know I'm capable of more but don't know how to progress forward as everytime I try to change my situation it back fires on me some how. 

I'm currently sitting on a Monday on my bedroom floor upset. Why can't I do anything with my life? Why does everything have to be so complicated? 🥺

Thank you for Reading"
JustAMatterOfOpinion,2022-01-24 08:36:53+00:00,I'm growing apart from all my friends and it's making me really fucking depressed.,"I have a habit (perhaps a bad one) of relying heavily on my friends for support and just to make me feel good in general. Not that their my only source of happiness, but it's really hard for me to feel secure and in a good place if I feel I have no close friends. Loneliness just hurts me so much. I made some pretty good friends in high-school and we've been hanging out pretty consistently for a couple years but now I feel we're all changing as people and I don't feel nearly as close to them as I used to and sometimes I can't even tolerate their presence. Feeling really shitty about it and I don't know how to cope with this feeling."

Larryland1968,2022-01-23 19:19:44+00:00,I chose you,"I chose you. Every single moment for six hundred and thirty-three days, I chose to love you. To believe you. To forgive you. To embrace you. I chose to stand by you even when times got tough and nearly unbearable. Even when I had lost nearly everything and knew I probably should stop. I kept choosing you. Maybe I thought that you would change. That things would get better. Maybe I just had nobody else and an incredibly low self-esteem. Something that you constantly reminded me. Maybe I just wanted you to fucking choose me back. Just one time. Once. If I walked away, I had nothing. Except wasted time and a broken-heart. This had to be worth it, I thought to myself. You had to be worth it. I saw something that nobody else saw. I knew you. Right? But I ignored everything. I dismissed red flags and deal breakers and all the standards I had made for myself. I found myself making up excuses for you, being too understanding. Caving and bending and breaking every step of the way. In choosing you, I begin to stop choosing me. I stopped choosing the things that I loved, the people that I loved. Choosing you was all-consuming. It took everything inside me to do it. To continue to love you and stick around every single day. I lost myself. And then I started to believe that I didn’t have a choice anymore. Loving you was the only thing I had, and I couldn’t give that up, too. So I stayed. I stayed much longer than I should and much longer than I wanted. I ignored family and friends telling me to leave, to get out, to choose myself. How could I do that to you? I thought that I was helping you, fixing you. This was my only purpose in the world: choosing you. You had slowly convinced me that I deserved it all. I deserved you and the pain and the choice of choosing somebody who never chooses you back. Nobody would ever choose me, you said. I was lucky. But today is the day that I stop choosing you. I delete all the pictures of you from my Facebook. The happy times that never seemed to last. I watched as our smiling faces disappeared, and I cried at how it was possible to both love and hate somebody. There were so many good memories mixed in with the bad. There was so much longing and desire still left, but also so much pain. Unbearable amounts of pain. I never wanted to stop choosing you. Even as I type these words, my heart aches. For you. For us. For you to just finally choose me back. And I wonder how long it will feel like this. I imagine time will dull the discomfort, make life a little more tolerable. Every day that I stop choosing you, I will start choosing me. I will choose my passions and my photography and my books and my writing. I will choose to remember what I love about myself and perhaps begin to fall in love with life again. Every moment that I don’t choose you, I will get stronger. Happier. Wiser. I will realize that I made the right choice, and I will continue to make it until I find somebody new to choose. Somebody to love me the way that I deserve. The way that I have always deserved but never really knew. The day I stopped choosing you will, one day, be a distant memory. But for now, for the moment, it will be a sad, emotional day that I wish was not happening."

She stopped talking and told me my eyes are red and puffy. Suddenly tears were flowing and I wanted to scream. She gave me tissues and I cried it out. 
I tried to articulate how I really feel but it was so hard to properly tell her everything going on in my head and life. And the more I talked the more I realized she can't relate at all. Her advice would be ""just do whatever makes you happy"" etc. After a while I stopped trying to make her understand and thanked her for listening. She's my closest, most trusted friend so I thought I would feel better to talk to her. It's the first time I cried like that in so long. I just ended up feeling more alone."

Earlier I used to go for morning runs, do yoga, keep a calorie check and stuff but now I see I have messed up with my sleep schedule and diet too. I get so many sugar cravings and I have been eating junk lately. My life is pretty much annoying right here. Is it like normal or just me ? Also please suggest me how to be productive."

sadbaby23,2022-01-23 13:31:45+00:00,Manic,"Today I was manic for the first time in months. I got that burst of energy that I needed to be doing something. Today I finally got some cleaning done that I have been putting off for quite a while. Today I got out of bed and showered started probably 4 projects I know I won't finish because tomorrow I probably won't be manic again for a long period. 

I wish things were different, and it didn't take me 3 months to feel energetic and motivated. I wish I could just feel normal sometimes. On my manic days I love life, I actually feel the reason for getting out of bed and I think ""maybe this time I can just stay happy."" But it isn't real..

I never do. I wake up the next day, sometimes 4-5 days in between when I'm lucky, and my depressive lows are back, my bed feels like a prison and all I want to do is sleep forever. The lows feel like they're lasting longer. My manic days are fewer and far between. I know some people who hate being manic because they feel out of control, but for me it is almost like a glimpse into what life could actually be like if I wasn't stuck in my own head. I am a prisoner to my own brain, and I'm so tired of fighting."

Whenever I think of an answer to that question, my mind just sees nothing - imagines nothing. I just don't see myself in the future, or ever being in the future where most people would say that they're ""successful"" in whatever it is that they're passionate about. It's as if I know myself that I won't have any future, that someday I would just be gone. I won't be able to do any future stuff because I won't live long enough to witness it or even have one. The future that I see is just complete darkness, a void."

I always wake up in the morning to see nobody greeting me with a good morning. I put on the hoodie I always wear, it brings back nostalgia, when I was young my best friend gave it to me. And til this day.. I still wear it. That's just how important it is to me. As I think about the past, I always realise that nothing in my life has been good and.. My life is miserable... Nobody cared about me. My life is so bad and- So sad. I hope I die soon knowing the fact that I will die alone, nobody would even realise I have died. Ugh. It doesn't matter anymore, I always try to make myself feel better by getting breakfast, toast and some milk. It alwats brings me joy and happiness when I eat because, I starve myself, and it's really difficult for one such as myself to eat. Everyday I just hate myself more and more, and the only thing thats keeping me going is- My gold fish who has been here ever since I was young. He is my best friend, my only friend.. His name is Jimmy, named after my great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandpa's dog. I always get super sad when I have to leave Jimmy on his own, sometimes i can't even take my eyes off of his precious scales, but I aways tell myself that I have to leave.. I always get tears in my eyes when i imagine Jimmy on his own when I walk to school, it's always a pain whwn i walk to school.. Everyone bullies me, and everyone hates me, my life just sucks and it hurts. Sometimes I wonder.. How people put up with me... I always get lost in deep thoughts such as those. But I'm not like the other kids in school, I get A+ in every subject ever to be invented in highschool, and everyone gets so jealous. It's a nice feeling when you see someone jealous of you. But my grades just makes my life worse.. Everyone hates me because I'm better than them. I get kicked in the balls and punched in the stomach, life is just hard sometimes. I sometimes forget about my surroundings and keep my cool. Nobody wants to see my true form, my true self. So I try to stay calm when I'm at school. But until it ends, I just get bullied even more, so sometimes i run back home with tears in my eyes, books in my arms and my backpack swinging on one arm of mine. I run to the kitch then eat as many vitamins as I can to try to end the misery. To end it all, but it hit me, my best friend Jimmy is here for me. Jimmy is all I need. So I put down the vitamins and feed Jimmy, then bring my depressed 4'9 self to bed, but I couldn't sleep, with all those voices mumbling inside my head. I just cant handle them all... So I get off of my bed and go to the balcony as I sing my tunes. I sing and sing until all the voices inside my head is gone. Then I bring myself back to sleep. Them it restarts all over again...."

wowokayisee,2022-01-22 17:02:43+00:00,It's returned with a vengeance...,"Hi, all... So, my depression has recently returned - kinda with the new year. I was sick late Dec, early Jan, and I got sick a few days ago and am recovering from that. All sinus stuff. I'm sure this was one of the triggers. Along with the that, I've also recently cut contact with my SIL and brother for the time being. I'm also unemployed (despite applying) and have been since the last place I worked closed down and, surprise!, since my ex and I broke up (mutually). I'm also currently living with my parents. My mom researches world events and shares all her research and opinions with me all the time, she confides in me emotions and finances, and she stresses me a lot by asking for my advice or trying to push me to give someone else advice. My dad has recently had surgery, has pain issues, gets angry/upset easily, constantly misunderstands things, then beats himself up about it and over apologizes, and he also sufferers from depression. My room's a mess and I just can't seem to get my crap together.

I was in a GREAT place before a few months ago. Heck, I was better than now last month. But, now? I keep trying and trying to do the right and healthy thing to take care of myself, but I fail. I know I need to do this and do that, improve this skill, apply for this and that, but I cannot motivate or bring myself to do ANYTHING at the moment. I'm back to just wanting to disappear. Before, my depression seemed to be linked with anxiety, but now it just seems to be pure depression. It's been a while since I've felt so drained and empty simply getting up to eat that it doesn't seem worth it. I don't wanna go and pay for counseling again, especially since I know what all I need to do, but I'm so deep in it right now. Why bother. 

I just really needed to share this stuff with ppl who could understand and who don't know me irl. I'm trying, but it is so freaking hard!"
Careless_Baseball_99,2022-01-22 16:56:04+00:00,Feeling lonely and as if my life isn't important.,"I haven't had the hardest life but not being able to graduate college the way I wanted to, a (teaching degree), really hurt me. This was about 8 years ago. So I been with my girlfriend for 14 years and she is doing so well atleast with life and having a good job. Im so proud of her but I have always kinda just shyed away from everyone, family specifically, due to use moving away about 30 mins away. This has always made me feel weird but also I'm kinda a loner. Anyways I been on a pretty low dose of sertraline for OCD and anxitey, but I wanted to maybe see if stopping that will pull me out of this funk and maybe try another job or find a passion. However, it's a little scary and also I do get high with delta 8 if anyone knows what that is, it's like a mild marijuana, but you can still get as high. So I'm on here looking for some hope in life and just want to hear someone that maybe feels like life has gotten you scared in a way cause im 35 and in a good place financially (girlfriends a nurse) but I feel like I haven't accomplished anything and just been sad. I have bad anxiety and getting high helps but I feel I need to always get even higher because sometimes I'm not where I want to be. Im just going to keep trucking.  I had a job for 9 years after college but not somethings I wanted to commit my whole life to, so I did get another job something more physical, and because of there pay system and getting covid, so I ended up quitting and just being at home. Its really nice me and my girlfriend in our nice house, but something inside me is missing and I feel like time is passing me by and my anxiety is very high like it's always been.

ShineLokabrenna,2022-01-22 15:24:31+00:00,I want to try loving someone,"Hi,
For about 5ish years, ive suffered from an anxiety disorder that has only grown worse. It s got so bad, i suffer depressive episodes and battle with suicide occassionally. My efforts to recover have been stunted by things both in and out of my control.

One thing ive always wanted to try was dating someone. Ive had mang people like me, and while I accept at first, i always crumble under my anxiety and are unable to continue. My anxiety is absolutely brutal when it comes to relationshipe, i get rather ill and suffer panic attacks.

Theres a person whose likes me for years and has matured over this time a lot. He is rather kind and understanding. One time i got absolutely pissed and we spent hours just hugging in my friend's tree house that was covered in vomit (not ours) but we were too gone to care. It was great because all we did was hug and say how we'd like to date. I admitted my anxiety is horrible and we had tried dating before, and i knew it would likely result in the same thing. He shrugged and said well maybe we can just try and if it doesnt work then whatever. Dang this guy is kind. He doesnt seem to mind that im queer, ridden with mentel illness and definately not the easiest person to date. I felt strong with the alcohol in ny blood but as soon as I began to sober I hid in my friend's room and dipped first thing in the morning. He asked me over text how i felt and I was like, im sorry you're bloody cute but my brain is a shit show we are better being friends. Ive turned him down a couple times im the past (when i felt no interest) but now that i want to try, its so hard.

I honestly have never gone on a date with a single person without breaking down. Its pathetic and situations like this fuel my depressive, intrusive thoughts that im doomed to be alone forever so i should never bother trying.

I just wish i could go on a date with him, get to know him that way without the panic attacks and all the rest. It fucking sucks!! I want to be normal!! Let me enjoy relationships and explore!!! Ffs its such a simple thing that so many people do but anytime i get affection back i feel like literally dying to escape it. While i suffer from intrusive suicidal thoughts, i have no intention to harm myself. 

If you somehow read all this, thanks champ.


Tldr: i want a relationship but mental illness fucks that up and leaves me feeling more miserable than i was before"

Perfect_Pepper_5671,2022-01-22 05:28:23+00:00,I’m in a void.,"Hi, this feels unnatural for me. I don’t like disclosing the fact I feel an immense amount of depression and dissociation but I feel compelled to as idk what else to do. 

To be completely honest my life isn’t necessarily bad. My childhood wasn’t bad, I had a mother who was loving and my best friend at the time, and a father that was stoic but present. They lived together for my sake but weren’t married nor together. Basically roommates. But I had a roof over my head clothes on my back but even at the time of elementary I was depressed. I’d shoot a basketball by myself and ask why I was so miserable already. It made no sense. It still doesn’t. 

How can someone who’s lived a regular life be filled with so much unexplainable sadness? I don’t have a rhyme or reason to be. Even today I’m currently in the military but I have a bed a phone food friends games beer but nothing fills my void. 

I want love or at least think I do since that’s the only time I’ve ever felt remotely okay but even then it sits in my chest and lingers like heartburns. I’ve felt loved before but even then it’s not enough. I’ve had lasting relationships that span years and in the end it’s just two sick people trying to cure each other. Running test on each other to see what works and what can fix the others issues. 

I know this is long and I’m sorry. I don’t know if anyone will read this but I’ll say this. I don’t know why I am depressed and because I don’t know why I’m depressed I can’t stop being depressed."
throwawayblue900ss,2022-01-22 05:02:16+00:00,Why live? Why go on? I just want my suffering to end!,"I was never enough, but more was always expected of me.

I was never loved, but that is all that I wanted, and it was always denied to me.

For several years now, I have tried and tried to form romantic relationships, but I can never get there.

I can flirt, make women laugh, even break the touch barrier, and have them touch me back as well.

But, when the rubber meets the road, I can't get a girlfriend. Tons of people want FWB, but I'm not about that life! Why can't I have someone to love and love me back?! Why does this always escape me, no matter what I do?!

The answer is obvious: I am not enough. I am not enough to be caressed, kissed, cared about. 

I don't want yet another ""friend"", and that is all I get. ""Friends""!

They love flirting with me. They love touching and being touched by me. They love looking into my eyes while we talk. They love to smile at me. They love my company. They love to snoop on my life as if they have any designs on making me a boyfriend. They love getting my hopes up (even if it is unintentional!). They love shattering my hope for a love into countless pieces.

Well, I can't put these pieces back together anymore, and I am tired of sleeping alone. I am tired of never getting any texts asking how I am! I am tired of not being missed, needed, made love to! I have no one to give birthday gifts or receive gifts from!

Valentine's Day is coming up, and you know, as always, I will be alone, unloved, single, cold, and full of hatred. My anger and hatred for myself and my situation is the only thing keeping me alive! My hope is gone! I will never know what love is! I will never be a loving husband and father! 

I wish I could just sleep and never wake up again! I just want to go somewhere warm where I can finally feel love, touch, acceptance.

I just want to be human. 

Why, why, why does my life involve a never-ending series of disappointments and rejections?! Why am I to live? What is the point? Who gains from this misery and isolation?!

Someone give me the same advice I have followed all my life. Please tell me that self-improvement, not looking for love, making tons of friends, having an active social life like in the movies is going to solve all my problems and wrap a giant red bow on top and bring me what I have always wanted, what I have always needed, what I am apparently unworthy of! 

I have lost my will to live."

I got a job and was able to pay for my own things, I had stopped all contact with my dad after more incidents while here and it was just me, my mom and my brother. We moved on and when I went to college, my depression got worse. I even stopped following my religion (it was forced on me) my panic attacks got worse and my family thought I was possessed by a demon. I was diagnosed with depression and when I told my mom, she was outraged saying “how could you be depressed, you don’t even have kids or wife yet. What are you going to do when you have a family?” This made it worse. I struggled with college and couldn’t ever focus or even find motivation. Fast forward to September if 2021. I am 23 years old and my mom lives with me. I had 2 beautiful kittens which my mom hated. I had them for about 5 months and one night when I came home from school. I found her laughing for no reason. I immediately went to check in my cats and found she threw one of them out several miles away so he doesn’t come back and I don’t find him. I lost my mind. I hadn’t eaten or slept for about 2 days and ended up fainting on the kitchen floor when she was at work. I said I’m leaving and she can keep the house to herself. I found apartment with roommates which sucked and could never really stay there. I moved back in but things aren’t the same. I plan on saving up more money and leaving everyone behind. My brother was also a terrible person that lived watchin my parents beat me and he even lied regularly to them just to get me in trouble. Anytime he acted out, we would both get beat but they would be harder on me (he’s 2 years older) now I’m here, my cats are safe with me and I have tried to kill myself a few days ago. I cut my wrists but couldn’t cut deep enough. My goal now is to save up as much money as possible and move to a different country and leave everyone besides my cats behind me. (I rescued another cat from the street and couldn’t give him away)."

While there, my grandparents (my dads parents) were also nightmares. They beat me and even tried to run over me. In Palestine, it was a small village where everyone knew everyone. Everybody there hated my grandpa and so even the kids hated my family. Making friends was difficult and the teachers there also beat students, rarely so needing to be hospitalized. My mom continued saying nightmarish stuff and beating me, even saying she was going to abandon me and my brother for us to go live with my dad. One specific incident where I wouldn’t let my little cousin play with my Nintendo DS led to him and his brother was my age to attack me. I simply defended myself but my mom didn’t care. It happened in front of neighbors so she beat me I front of them and dragged me upstairs and threw me down the stairs then started hitting my face and eye with a broom stick and slippers while I was having a panic attack. The more I panicked the more she beat me. It just kept getting worse and worse from there. When I was 16 we came back to the US and lived in a basement with terrible furniture and it basically looked like a hole."
Substantial_Summer_9,2022-01-22 02:15:34+00:00,Depressed and Lost Part 1,"I am a 23 year old male and I have been suffering from depression my life and here is my story. The first 7 years of my life were great. There were some bumps but that’s normal, what wasn’t normal however was that I hadn’t even met my father until I was 7. I grew up living with my mom and brother and we kept moving from one of my uncles house (my moms brothers) to the other every month or so. It was great, I was around other kids my age and we used to play a lot. My mother however was a nightmare, I just hadn’t realized it yet. The most traumatic thing I could remember during those 7 years was my first day at preschool. I cried a lot and was told to go home. During the drive home, my aunt who was the driver stopped at a grocery store while me and my mom stayed in the parking lot. She was furious that I kept crying and even bit my butt. I still have the scar on my butt even now and whenever I cried for her to stop, she forced me to be quiet as she bit me harder. Then my dad came and asked us to move back in (his brother forced him to take us in) during that time my mom kept on telling us what a nightmare my dad was and this was true. He was rarely home and whenever he was, we had to act like we didn’t exist or he would beat us bloody where it wouldn’t show to outsiders (mainly on my legs). My mom also viscous my attacked me at any small issue, like accidentally dropping a plate or cup. It got to the point where even as a kid I was basically just a hollow shell of a person, no life or idea of fun. When I was 10, my dad came home drunk and I woke up to him and my mom beating each other, she was punching him and he was slapping and choking her. They were fighting at the foot of my bed. Me and my brother cried out for help and my uncle came along and so did my other uncles (we lived in a apartment full of family) they fought and smashed the apartment and there was blood and broken glass all over the floor and walls. My dad then called after he ran away when the cops came (we were forced to say nothing was going on by my uncles) and he said he would kill all of us. We eventually ran away to Palestine."

They have boyfriends or girlfriends, they passed their driving tests, sending applications to Universities. Not me. It's not a lifestyle I idolise, but I envy the fact that my friends live their lives without worrying of the consequences. They're adults, or almost, and they all have so much more going than me.

I guess once a failure at it always going to be one. Can't even do that correctly. Funny enough it wasn't even a boulder this time that tipped me back into the pit, it was something small and simple that started this avalanche and it sucks because all of the progress or steps forward i have walked or every inch i climbed. just. is gone. and now i'm at square one. other people get to live thier life and sure they have challenges but they aren't restrained like some of us are. we can't ever dig out of this pit and i'm tired of acting like i can. it's only a matter of time before this relationship ends, and after that. who knows. maybe i'll be lucky and get struck by lightning. a man can fantasize can't he. regardless. this is just. either hell.

I appreciate you caring for me and how you want me to succeed, however, I need to tell ya something. I can't just snap out of my unmotivated self-doubting mood- I've fought these demons my whole life. 

The last time I told you I was depressed you told me ""but why your life is great"". Depression doesn't care who you are, what you believe, or how well you have had it in life, it's an emotionless hungry beast that indiscriminately attacks whomever it feels. It doesn't care that my life has been ""better"" than yours. 

You want me to start a business with you because I have a business degree, but buddy the truth is I hardly have the energy to get out of my bed every day, let alone start planning for the future. So again I want to thank you for your ""help"" but I'm going to have to go without, I'd rather not take down someone with me. I'd rather ""limit"" myself than destroy your world when I don't contribute enough to your life. 

I know that you see great ""potential"" in me and it means a lot but if I'm being honest all I want out of life is a simple non-complicated, peaceful existence where my mind can feel safe and secure. If you can't be friends with me because I don't want your motivation then so be it, I like quiet solitude more anyways. 

Sincerely, your ""friend"" who deals with depression."

Ok-Try-7732,2022-01-21 04:08:11+00:00,i don’t know what to do,"for a little context im a male and just turned 17 and have two older sisters that i was extremely close with.

four years ago one of my sisters (age 17 at the time) died in a car accident walking distance from my house. i am not known to be very expressive with my feelings as i feel it puts too much pressure onto other people and makes everyone uncomfortable. i usually have a pretty good wrap on dealing with my issues by myself and for a couple years my sisters death wasn’t weighing on me as i have been told it should have. but in the past couple of years i felt something that i wasn’t used too. i suddenly was super tired all the time, couldn’t sleep and if i did it was one extreme or the other, meaning i either only slept a couple of hours or most of the day. nothing i did day to day got my attention or was interesting not even my hobbies. i was always anxious, i couldn’t concentrate and i was feeling down for no apparent reason. my school was starting to suffer as well. 

my parents is a whole other issue but in short my parents were constantly fighting on the verge of divorce and too busy to notice what was going on, which i was okay with them not knowing as they tend to make it a little worse. my dad would often take his grief out on me, though never touching me he was constantly yelling. all i did was work full time and school, occasionally hanging out with my friends. i just chalked it up to working to much and moved on but it’s been weighing me down for so long. a month ago i finally told my dad what was going on and he understood and leaned off on the pressure a bit

i don’t know what’s wrong with me. and i don’t wanna say i’m depressed as i know friends who do have depression and i don’t wanna be one who self diagnoses as i feel i don’t wanna make it seem like i want attention

i flew out to work for my uncle as i just needed to get away. today i finally asked for a therapist to see if that will help with what ever is going on. i waited so long because i knew parents would bombard me with question that i don’t feel comfortable answering to them. this is exactly what happened and i told them i’m not comfortable telling them and they kept pushing and pushing. i know they are just worried about me and am afraid i’m just being self centered and selfish with the whole situation. my parents kept trying to guilt me into telling them things i don’t want to. it’s was so hard trying to ask for a therapist i don’t think i am ready to talk to them specifically about my feelings. day to day i try not to break down in front of my little cousins and family and have tried to just move along.

I don’t feel like I want to get better and that feels crazy to say. Especially like now where I just feel nothing. If I don’t feel at my lowest I feel like I’m faking being depressed. I wish I could just accept it.

Nobody needs you. Everyone will be fine without you. Who really needs you like really. 31 years old and just  nothing but a burden. To myself to my family even. Like legit putting all emotions aside I am technically not needed by anyone. I have 0 dependents which is why this thought is 100 times more comforting.

Gabriel_Fabianino,2022-01-20 21:52:59+00:00,I'm not happy anywhere and seems like I will never be happy ever,"I'm at my friend's house, I'm going to live here for 2 months (in theory) to study and than go back to my parent's house. I wasn't happy at my house, because my family isn't good, so I've been trying to move out.

So I did, now I'm here, it has been 3 days already, I'm simply not happy, I made an appointment with a therapist for the next week here, I feel safer to do this here, last time I heard that my psychologist was talking to my mom, in other state (where my friend live) she can't do that.

I live in a building where my two best friends live, in different apartments, wich sounds great right? So why the fuck I'm not happy? Why I can't enjoy being here? I'm sick of this, it's been too much time already and I'm tired.

Idk who said that baby steps works, but seems like it doesn't, I always end up in the same way, thinking about suicide or whatever (wich no one knows it). I won't do it, at least not now, but sometimes this is in my mind.

I just want to be happy, I'm not asking for a big thing, but people in my life (most my family) seems to do everything to make me miserable. Sometimes it feels like I deserve it, I know I don't, but it's hard to remember that when everyone seems to want to kill you somehow.

My friends never made me feel that way, actually, they are one of the reasons I'm still here I guess, but it doesn't changed the feeling, it's there, constantly, it never stops and it's been too much time. I'm tired.

I'm going to turn 18 this month, it shouldn't be that hard to be happy right? I tried everything, nothing works."

So, it was a group where there were many people and this guy let's call him sam was an old member and had many friends there. So, we both wrote the first chapter and the second chapter together and I really enjoyed it. I was really happy. But one day he sent me a section of the third chapter to review if it was okay or not. I just replied with,"" yeah, it's good"". It waa really perfect so there was nothing for me to add in it. After that he sent few other sections of the novel and i replied the same because it was really flawless. Then he suddenly blocked me removed me from the group and removed all of my credits.(where i was mentioned). Few mins back, the third chapter just got published and I am feeling really sad seeing it. Not because of what he wrote it is still really good. But i just feel really sad seeing that chapter getting posted.

BruhArmin,2022-01-20 07:04:12+00:00,I'm scared of falling into deeper depression.,"      Hello! I made my reddit account a while back so my username ""BruhArmin"" is absolutely embarrassing 😂. Anyways, I'm 14 and I think I'm turning depressed. I've told my friends I think I'm ""depressed"" before but right now it feels insanely different. I'm always tired, I can't get out of bed, and I'm starting to care less about everything. I have good friends and family but I'm sure it's mainly my parents. They don't show that much affection for me, and I hate myself that I want their affection. As you know Asian parents aren't exactly the best parents.
      My dad (Mainly raised in Italy and America) is a really bad parent in my eyes. He can't seem to remember crap about me or my siblings (he doesn't even know how old I am), he laughs it off whenever I try bringing up a serious subject, a hypocrite, and has anger issues (he has high blood pressure now). Now for my mom... She's definitely better than my dad. But still not a good parent in any sense. She doesn't pay attention to shit what I say, she's a hypocrite, and maybe manipulative???? She's really hard to explain for me and maybe because she's manipulating me 🤷.
      They would both get really mad at me for doing something and then they would go on and do it themselves. I gave up in school because I don't see a reason to try. I'm not going to drop out but my parents don't show any, I mean not a single drop of affection when I get straight A's. Hell they don't even notice I get straight A's until I mention it which they just say ""cool"" while obviously not caring. They somehow can see my missing assignments though. The second it says missing they bug me about it, I just wish they had that same attention to my A's. My dad also has mood swings, one minute he's happy, one minute he's so angry he's about to kill someone. Sometimes I would fight back to my parents trying to say in a polite way ""I don't like that you do this and that and maybe we can work it out"" which my mom either doesn't pay attention or just acts like she's right and I'm wrong (it's always those two) but then my dad sometimes would get extremely mad and scream at the top of my lungs at me. He pushes, pinches, slaps, and not super hard punches me. My mom would just throw a slipper until I was 10, then she switched to boots. Now I give up, fuck life. I don't know if I can last longer."
lassitari30,2022-01-20 06:27:42+00:00,i am never enough," 

Please someone read this I have no one to talk about this without sounding stupid.

I don't want to feel this way, I can't stop crying I'm never enough, I feel so stupid, unwanted and ugly and jealous!

Note: me and my crush have been classmates since primary school (we graduated high school some moths ago) same school.

My friends and his girlfriend were classmates/friends in other school.

My friends who are friends with my classmate who has been my biggest crush for the past 10 + years (yes I know....) Won't stop telling me how similar I am to his girlfriend and they want me to meet her because they think we could become best friends and I was like okayyy(? I don't know her like at all) i didn't tough about it at first but then other ppl that know her from a city club that I'm in started asking me if I knew her because we were so similar so I got curious and I kinda stalked her.

I am speechless.. She's literally all I want to be, first time in my life that I've felt this way, so jealous and not enough and she doesn't even know I exist!! I'm so ashamed of myself

We look alike A LOT! but she's prettier and skinnier than me, her fashion style is like same as me but I can't afford it so I don't dress like it, our favorite artist are the same!, she got in my dream uni (that I can't afford), she has the bedroom of my dreams, a big loving family, lots of friends, a nice car and she's my crush's girlfriend!

This feels like a sad joke to my existence!

Why he chose her and not me? I've always been there for him but I guess I'm not enough

And I know is not my personality bc we have basically the same one!

Her life is so perfect, her parents are doctors and business owners and mine didn't even graduated from college! (My dad dropped out of medical school, YES EVEN THAT WE ALMOS HAD IN COMMON) so she's loaded, my parents are so broke it hurts, mom doesn't have a job and my dad is a modern slave in a physical job, they're always fighting and I barely have the bare minimum things, hand me down clothes, an outdated Android phone, like 4 pairs of shoes and I can't afford to go to uni! I'm so sick of my life! I'm so depressed (not bc of this, I was depressed waay before and I quit meds) and on top of that now I can't stop comparing myself to barbie version of myself."

mxphxtz,2022-01-20 01:18:24+00:00,Struggling with heartache..,"I've (18Nonbinary) been struggling with a really, really tough break up. My ex (22M) and I have been together for a little over two years and throughout it -- and especially towards the end -- he's been incredibly manipulative and abusive. Him and his mother (42F). Anytime anything happened, she immediately took his side and coddled him. She would belittle me for being transgender. She was too involved in our relationship, and he was too much of a Mama's Boy to do anything about it.

Anyways, in early October, before the break up, my ex had been getting closer and closer with a coworker. It started with having her number. She was flirtatious in the beginning and I felt on edge about it. Later on, my ex's abuse got worse. He gaslighted me and said horrible things to me, blaming it on weed or alcohol or being tired. Saying other people were ""more f*ckable"" than me and that I was his little ""c*mdump"" at the end of the day, so I shouldn't have been sad in the first place.

It gradually got worse. I told him if he didn't change, I'd leave. Like I told him countless times before, of course he'd only ""change"" for a week, and then it was back to his old ways. And his mom constantly vouching for and enabling him. He got angrier as the days went on. He said he had kissed the girl twice at work, and I had saw their texts of him saying he was her happiness and everything, it hurt. It really did.

In the days leading up to that, I had cried and pleaded for hours, just wanting to know why he always had to be so mean to be. All I wanted was for him to love me, but instead he took a completely different route and decided to cheat on me. People have said it was to show that he had, and still has, power, but either way it hurts.

After my ex had cheated on me with the coworker, she ironically turned out to be a bitch to him. She made rumors about his sexuality to their feels coworkers at his job, and turned out to be the kind of girl who fucks around and is still hung up over her ex.

I don't know if he felt guilty about treating me terribly, just for her to treat him terribly, or what. But he was even worse after that. I had to block him on everything and I swear it's been the most difficult thing ever.

He still felt entitled to me, not seeing his wrongs. Even going as far as to say that I caused him to cheat, and it was my fault. Before getting the strength to completely cut him out of my life, he invited me over in an attempt to ""fix"" things, only for him to say that he'd f*ck me raw to show how much he really loved me. His mindset is twisted, and it breaks my heart that we had something that felt perfect and happy to me, but all along, there were so many holes in it. 

I'm sorry that this is probably incoherent, this was mostly just a rant for myself.

TL;DR : Abusive ex, cheating, feeling lost and unloved. Not feeling good about myself. Missing him. Feeling replaceable."

I don't want to feel like a fuck up but there are times I seem to be subconsciously self sabotaging and I can only think some part of me refuses to allow myself some happiness. Its really ridiculous when I think about it but i suppose its not supposed to make sense. Anyone else feel this"

Impossible-Paint9122,2022-01-19 18:59:53+00:00,Is being an over sensitive person okaay in today’s world?,"So I have noticed this one thing about me that I am too sensitive with certain issues which people of Gen Z are quite cool about. 

I feel like everyone who’s there in my life is gonna hurt me at some point so I created an internal barrier within myself. I have limited conversations with people around me, like limiting myself to just formal conversations only. I feel I don’t belong anywhere and people are better than me so I keep doubting my true potential. I always question myself that do I really deserve this? Am I a mistake or something?

Also the fact that I can’t help a downpour after someone’s been acting shit with me rather being rude to that person also makes me different rather I would say vulnerable. People find me as an easy target so I thought maybe the place should be void.

I have never been expressive about my feelings like I have this feeling inside me that people will leave me. After all who wants to be with a shitty person who’s super sensitive and always complaining.

 I dunno if it’s with y’all out there but when I feel like it’s coming, omg I’m about to cry I rush somewhere and try to be all by myself. I’d be in the washroom all by myself crying then I would be back to normal and pretend to be okaay cause I don’t want them to think of me as some sort of cribbing and nagging cry-baby. To be around a bunch of people and still feel lonely, sad and gloomy cause deep down I know what’s inside me but then life goes on and on."

Dani_Bowie_1985,2022-01-19 12:38:04+00:00,I don't know what to feel about anything any more.,"So this will be a quick rant post. As of this moment I'm feeling really depressed like I can really feel it sorta hopeless and sad. This honestly came about on my official 21st birthday just recently. I'm in college I'm dealing with academic stress, emotional trauma, and fears of my and our society's future. Like Im feeling and dealing with a lot at 21 and I don't know how to feel about it. Plus it doesn't help that I am a woman and as we all know there are a lot of things that are scary about womanhood outside and internally. I just can't help but feel like the world is so fucked up and that I am fucked up too and I can't handle it anymore I just want the madness of life to just end or just my fears of life and living and doing stuff goes away. Like everything is madness and ughhh I hate it. It would be nice to just feel calm, confident, happy, positive, and at peace. But I can't and feeling at peace is so hard for me. For I am a person used to tearing myself from the inside out and it doesn't help when I feel that the only true way of peace is just complete and utter erasure of ones being. I guess the best comparison to how I feel can be equated to Mr.Meeseeks in Rick and Morty to where they understand that life is pain and lol they don't wanna stay around for long and just stay long enough for the task at hand. Anyways in the end I feel like I'm not aloud to just curl myself into a ball and just cry it out until I personally feel better or  if I don't get better Im just supposed to feel better. Like I feel like the motto of life is just suck it up you baby you just always have to deal with this madness. Its not fair."

throwawY578632,2022-01-19 08:06:32+00:00,i (17f) think my sister (15f) is being bullied,"Lately my sister has not been wanting to go to school and i saw while glimpsing over her shoulder someone had taken a picture of her face and out the caption “monkey” over it on snapchat and i didn’t ask her about it but i told my parents and they said “what can we do?” i was kind of shocked because normally wouldn’t you want to report that to school ? because hello that’s not okay. 
I’m not on good terms with my sister because she gets spoilt by my mom who didn’t teach her any manners or anything but i’m genuinely worried for her despite all of this. I have her schools email but i’m not sure what to write and i don’t want to get in trouble by my parents for “spreading our business with random people”. She has also gotten into fights with girls older than her but wasnt questioners about it so my parents don’t care.

my sister this morning didn’t get out of bed until 20 minutes before she had to be in school. my dad got really angry and started swearing like “whichever fucker doesn’t want to go to school don’t send them” which made my sister even more upset. man i fucking hate my parents 

i think she’s depressed and I don’t know what to do because she doesn’t talk to me. I think school at one point got her into a counselling thing but my mom kept saying to her “you don’t need it you’re a good girl you’re fine” and so she cancelled that with them."

This class was my first C and now it'll probably tank. Just ugh. I emailed my teacher abt this and idk what he's gonna do.

If it adds to anything I go to a top hs, but even w that credential I still feel like failing a class at a top hs is pretty shitty. I need to drop this class asap, it's been weighing on my mental health for weeks. I haven't felt sane since november. Everythings just gone downhill from here. I've been so destructive, taking chairs and throwing them at the wall, taking textbooks and just hitting them so hard on the floor. I cant control myself, and I cant control myself to study better for this final exam. I'm so damn fucking close to the end of first semester of my senior year, and yet it's been fucking stressful.

Dobbyssockpleaseth,2022-01-19 01:28:16+00:00,Everything seems like a dead end,"Despite the fact that I'm privileged, I simply don't see any path I could take in life that would bring me any joy or fulfillment. Instead, I only see that there are things I would be capable of doing that would bring me money. Other passions I used to have have now waned to the point where the level of difficulty the come with in terms of achieving success is enough to put me off entirely. Additionally, I feel completely and utterly suffocated by the responsibility I feel to be my parents' emotional caretaker. This emotional caretaker role extends to my friendships as well, and seems to be my ultimate ""talent"". Thusly, I've been pursuing psychology and have set myself up well to go down the path of obtaining a doctorate. Unfortunately, all I can keep thinking about that is: Do I really want to pursue something that demotes me to the role I've taken on my whole life as an anxious, depressed, co-dependent person? Indeed, I'm not truly happy doing what I'm doing right now.

Sure, I could go travel the world and take some time off and try to ""soul search"". But then what? I know that I'll just be depressed the whole time, resulting in disgusting wastefulness as I'll end up in the same exact place I'm in right now. This is especially true if I end up not making any money, because then I'll feel even more obligated to my parents. 

Not even romantic love comes into mind as a refuge. I messed up my view on love early by engaging in an extremely active sex life mostly with older men, which has led me to now fear and question any kind of romantic pursuit. Yes, I have also dated younger men, and it didn't change the way I felt. This is perhaps because I found out that I'm generally not desirable as a partner to the men I'm attracted to––I'm only as a hookup. Essentially, my standards are messed up and I'm generally distrustful. 

The only thing keeping me around aside from my parents are my friends and my cat, who love me very much. I know I'm very lucky for that. I wish that felt like enough in light of existential dread."

3dtrees3,2022-01-18 19:22:25+00:00,Chasing a girl ruined my life,"I moved to Germany so I could go back to school and start a new life outside the US. Things were rocky but tenable from the start, but I now realize that the point of no return, when I doomed myself to failure, was when I made an important career choice to stay with a girl. That is: I rejected a place studying urban planning in order to stay at my current university to be with the girl I was dating at the time. Less than a month later, she dumped me. Obviously, that was fucking stupid of me. I didn't realize it at the time, or rather was in denial of it. I'm reeling right now, realizing that I'm going to fail in my mission of 4 years. I have been so stupid, so stupid and depressed, so depressingly stupid. I put a girl who just wanted me for sex over my own future, and everything since has been nothing short of nightmarish. I've been failing my studies (because I have zero interest in them), have not been able to work enough to save anything (because student visa), and have been living with a narcissistic couple who have been taking advantage of me for 2 years now. 

Holy fuck, how did this happen? If I had one wish, it would be to wake up from this reality and have it be 2018 again, so I could relive that moment so I could make the right decision*.* Actually I know how this all happened. I've been living in denial of reality for a long time. I thought I would kill myself if I didn't date this girl, because I thought my only reason to live was to find romantic love, and without that I was nothing. I thought I could be happy in any profession as long as I had that, so I didn't care so much that I was setting aside my goals for her. I didn't consult or listen to anyone because past experience taught me that the closest people to me can't be trusted. I didn't understand the gravity of my decisions until now because it was so easy to dismiss everything with ""It'll all turn out alright."" Well I'm here to tell any who read this: no, it won't be fucking alright.

I have lost all hope. I can't go back to the US because I'll have literally nothing there, nothing except debt. I can't stay here because I am unmarried and have no career prospects, no hope of getting a blue card. What's worse: I have a medical condition which would go untreated in the US because I wouldn't have a car or insurance, so I couldn't get health insurance or work to pay the doctor bills. Holy shit, I am fucked. I don't want to kill myself, I've held out this long, but honestly I don't see any other choice except being homeless in the US. Holy fuck, it didn't need to be this way, but apathetic depression is what made it certain. 

I hate my life. I hate my roommates. I hate my family. I hate this town. I want revenge. I want a second chance. I want to wake up. I want to live, but I don't see any way forward."

Zealousideal-Rush153,2022-01-18 18:07:10+00:00,"I would really appreciate if you read this, this is my suicide letter!","(I've posted this before, it was deleted, so I rewritten it to be more family friendly, I hope it's okay and by the rules now)

This is a long read

This is the second time I am trying to do this, it's harder than I thought, I was going to kill myself yesterday, but I thought about it and decided to give another 24h, I still feel like doing it so today is the day, here are my goodbyes!

I should begin by saying that the situation I find myself in is of my own making, no one is to blame for my troubles but myself and my own actions, but I have to say, as the idiot and simpleton I am, that debt, loneliness and grieve are the major factors that took me to make this decision of ending my life this night.

How should I write this, dear reader? How does one write down it's last thoughts before death? Should I begin like David Copperfield, "" To begin my life with the beginning of my life ""? Or should I just cut to the chase and say my farewells in my final message?

If it is of your interest, dear reader, to get to know me? I shall begin by saying that happiness and joy are foreign concepts to me, for in the entirety of my short existence I was reduced to a mere object, serving other peoples pleasures and desires. Like a punching bag for others to use and unload all of their frustrations and perversions. Even with the small joys I enjoyed in life, the hollowness and unhapiness that surrounded me appeared to be far greater than any thing I could come to appreciate. Also you should know that I am plagued by death, it follows me like a phantom that never leaves my side and takes away everyone I love!

Suffice to say that, ever since the tender age of seven to age nine, I was repeatedly molested by my own cousin who used to babysit me while my parents were at word, both of them also were verbally and physically abusive towards me throughout my childhood and teenage years. It got serious enough that they lost custody of me in favor of my paternal grandmother, who was the angel of my life, saving my life multiple times alongside my than girlfriend, soon to be fiancé, Lari.

Truth is, dear reader, that I am not a stable person, the abuse and trauma left me with a pletora of mental disorders that won't allow me to socialize or even do anything beyond studying for my own pleasure. Here's where it comes the debt, I own money from student loans, lots of them, hoping that someday I could repay them with the fruits of my work, but since my fiancé died of covid last year, I could no longer function, I couldn't find the strength to work or study anymore. I could no longer afford my medication, rent or basic necessities due to the loss of my job.

This is how we ended up here, at the end of the line, some will say I had it easy, good even! And they're right, my life was good, even in the worst of times I had the quality of life of a middle class man in a third world country full of poor people. I had luxury of a hot meal everyday 3 times a day and good comfortable lodgings. But isn't the soul so much more important than the vessel, dear reader? Isn't the essence, your mind and spirit so much more important than the physical body? For my entire life I was a shell of a humam being, dead already, waiting to be buried.

But I shall leave behind a message of peace, and perhaps, of hope even! For know that in the end I know my suffering will end, so will my loneliness and emptiness, I finally feel at peace and calm after a lifetime of turmoil. To you, dear reader, i beg you to learn from my life and remember to enjoy every second of life, enjoy art, music, literature, video games, whatever brings you joy! Be kind, give and seek love in this world and show how much you care about your loved ones! Remember, in this last seconds, I am a happy man, and I love you, dear reader, from the bottom of my heart!

But now I just get bore  and I can't shake the feeling that I should be doing something better with my disappointing life. But what would that be? Apparently nothing, there are more droves of stupid monsters and bad guys to destroy in stupid ways. OH but also the numbers and skill sets match up to do some kind of synergy that is super coo. That one always gets me. There's always some thing that takes many hours to achieve to keep you playing. You'd think I would have learned my lesson from WOW. Video games ruin lives. After countless hours of playing them I feel cheated. It all added up to nothing and gave me ADD. If only I still had a girl friend.   
I have some free time. What should I do? Waste it on a video game that will probably put me in a bad mood. That makes sense."
ServnSwerv,2022-01-18 06:52:21+00:00,I don't know how to even get out of this..,"I've been in an abusive relationship for 8 years. He has been physical a couple of times and there has been sexual abuse, but mostly it has been emotional and financial. I grew up in an abusive home which I'm sure is why I picked an abusive partner. He has an extremely bad drug problem and he will steal from me. He also has a warrant for his arrest right now and is facing prison for a combo of both his abuse of drugs and me.

I finally got approved for an apartment I can afford and tonight I went to get the money for the deposit.. GONE. I wasn't even that surprised. I want to leave but I don't know how. I have no family or friends, he steals my money so I can't save up, and because he kept everything in his name I have no credit to get a loan even. I have no security at home because I don't know if I'll have a place to live next month because I never know when he will be arrested. I can't afford the rent where we live and even if I could.. I'm not on the lease. My job doesn't know I am still with him because I was too embarrassed to say I was after what happened (I had to call off work the day of the domestic violence charges and they found out through a newspaper the events). Luckily, I don't have kids in this mess but I also can't seem to find help with housing because I don't have kids and I make slightly more than the level to get help.. which is still not enough to survive (especially with a thief).

I just want to give up. I feel trapped and screwed and I keep hoping I'll just die. I'm not suicidal, mostly because I'm convinced I'd just end up in a worse state and still alive. I don't think I can keep trying. I feel tried out. I've literally lost hope. I sometimes wish he would just kill me but he won't.. I mean.. who will he steal from if I'm not here? My whole life has just been being abused and unloved. I just wish it would end."

For every moment I spend with them I feel better but when it’s taken away I feel like an idiot for just asking if I’m going to be ok. 

I’ve never had a girlfriend or a boyfriend and I gave up trying. I’m not good enough for anyone or for anything. My only use is to do what I’m told and where to be, then after that’s said and done I go back to my room all alone and feel nothing but empty."

rebububublution,2022-01-18 02:51:15+00:00,My life,"This post is going to drag on for a long time so if you want the tl;dr, here it is: my life sucks, poor me.

I was born in a small town in the states. We weren't rich but this was in the early 2000's. Things were pretty good but going to decline. I was 3 when my parents divorced. We moved to a smaller town, followed by another move and my parents getting back together for a while, only for them to split again and for my mother, siblings, and I to move into a small village elsewhere in the states. Things were pretty shitty. We were poorer than ever before, our water frequently got shut off, we lived in a shithole, and things were generally not good. Sometime when I was roughly nine, we got a dog. I treated it like shit because I had no other outlet for how I felt and didn't know how to express it. I still feel terrible about how I treated that dog. My mother dated a series of men, all shitty in their own ways. Every time she wanted to bring some man around the house we'd have to do lots of cleaning on top of the already ridiculous amounts of cleaning we already did. My mother kept to herself most of the time, only leaving her room to get groceries or to fix dinner, usually hamburger helper or some cheap garbage. This continued for some time until she met a man that she stayed with for more than a couple of weeks. I'll refer to this guy as Mike. Mike was a loud, angry bastard who yelled a lot. He was always onto us for something or other and he beat my ass more than a few times. Eventually my mother decided to break up with him. She didn't date anyone else for a while until she decided to date one more person. We'll call this person Jim. Jim was a lot like Mike. He yelled all the time, mostly for us to do our chores. Somehow this wasn't so bad. Our mother stayed with him for a year or so until we moved to the town he lived in. We stayed there for awhile until it was time to move again. The new place we moved into was okay. But around the time of this move things started to get worse. I recall that everything was suddenly taking its toll on me. I was very stressed out and became absurdly depressed. Most of the thoughts I had were about suicide or death. I manipulated my friends and did a lot of shitty things as a result of depression and I still feel like shit about it. I can't remember much about that time in my life except that I was depressed. I don't know why I stopped being depressed from that particular episode, it just happened. We moved a few more times, and I became depressed again. I don't know why. One day I just started to think about why I was alive and then I realized that I shouldn't be. But this episode was different. I kept to myself. I didn't tell anyone what I was going through. I joked about it here and there but I tried not to say or do anything that might make anyone worry about me. 

Nothing I do can turn my life around. I've hit a block and I'm just trying to keep going. But nothing I do will ever make life worth living. I don't see anything positive about myself. I don't find myself funny. I don't think I'm smart. I'm certainly not athletic or attractive. Hell, I'm not even dumb enough to not have to think about how much life sucks. I'm just bad at everything. I hate myself."
mahboilo7,2022-01-18 02:21:47+00:00,I will never find love and I'm depressed,"I'm 26 now. I never had any romantic (let alone sexual) relationships in my life. I guess I'm just too shy and socially awkward. I never even  managed to get a date. 

Anyway   I'm pretty sure that loneliness is what triggered my depression. In fact I can pinpoint exactly what triggered my most recent depressive episode. A certain incident made me want to kill myself:

At christmas my friend introduced me to his new gf. It was my first time meeting a trans person and it was even better than what I expected. She was so cute, and the way her voice still sounded like a dude sometimes turned me on a bit (don't judge me I'm being honest here). I couldn't help but feeling jealous.  Why does HE have all I ever wanted? I'm sad because I know I will never meet a woman who will love me, and there's even less chance that it will be a cute trans woman like my friend met. Why even live?"
killishious,2022-01-18 01:53:09+00:00,What went wrong?,"I know this is nothing compared to the problems that people have on here but I need someplace to vent.
This last year has been the lowest I’ve ever been in my life. At the start of my 11th grade, I was 
crippled with depression due to the realization that I wasn't the studios child that I thought I was and after my coaching started it was even worse. I was attending the classes 
without any interest and slaving away at the work, I used to be sad all day I would wake up every day 
and have this feeling hit me like a truck that my day had already been ruined and it would get ruined 
I didn’t study properly or do anything properly I would lay in bed all day and regret the choices that I 
had made. Then came the boards(an important exam) results which would be my breaking point in my mind I could 
justify why I had just gotten 82 percent but even the people who didn’t study as much as I had 
gotten better marks than me due to online tests in which I didn’t cheat because I wanted to be all 
high and mighty and wouldn’t cheat in the tests conducted online as I thought I was going to score 
better in the boards better anyway which were canceled. Seeing other people get 92 percent just 
because they were in a different school saddened me a lot and the fact that my close friends had got 
97 percent or even higher also made me feel out of place and worthless compared to them. It made 
me think that why couldn’t I be like them why my parents didn’t get the same results as the parents 
of other kids. Was I really going to score well in the boards exam or was it just another lie I had 
told myself along with countless others.When the results were announced I got a call from my English teacher who told me that I 
deserved more, more than some of the students in my class and I shouldn’t get depressed over 
the results and that was nice to hear but it made me think that was I ever good at studying because I was 
less than average in my previous school and in my current school at that time I was 3rd in a class of 
14 students(it was a new school), did that cause me to think highly of myself even though I wasn’t as good as I thought? I 
don’t know anymore. Self-doubt became a huge part of my day-to-day life after that. I felt like a 
worthless parasite just sucking my parents’ money for things I didn’t deserve or need. After I told my 
best friend that I was depressed he would just ignore it and talk about something else and I can’t
blame him he was 16 and in no way equipped to treat a person like me but saying something would 
have been comforting. But I do blame him for telling the people I didn't want to know i.e my other friends one of who started making fun of how I couldn’t 
handle scoring low marks as they had handled much worse and the person I trusted the most joined 
them as well, I became the laughing stock for many days and I still am. I used to tell my best friend 
many things and now those things are used by him to make fun of me in front of my other friends. I 
am not close with my family and have no one to share this with except the internet I feel like I have 
ruined my life by making such stupid decisions, the friends that I thought I could trust I don’t trust 
anymore I don’t trust anyone with my feelings anymore and I don’t think I will for a long time. My 
days just pass by as I lay in bed doing nothing as I can’t keep my mind on anything for long I don’t 
know what to do in life. I am surrounded by people who are good at life but here I am not being able 
to do the one thing I should: study. I don’t know what went wrong in my life or was I like this from 
the start but I have to persevere or I’ll end up in a place worse than this."

sorry for any english mistakes!

My grandma, the only family member I get along with, passed away one month ago, i've spent the last 10 years taking care of her, making sure she took her medication, bathing her, soothing her, watching telenovelas with her. She was my only company and my only friend, the only person in my life who ever showed me love and compassion. Now i'm all alone, I have no-one! She was the only tie I had with the world and reality, the only thing keeping me in this world, and now she's gone!

I am not a recluse per se. I can get out for groceries and stuff like that, I used to have a job (teacher), even a fiancé (passed away from covid last year), I used to have a life, but since my fiancé died I could not function in society anymore, I am overwhelmed by anxiety and sadness, i rarely leave the house.

I just ended up cutting everyone off from my life and I haven't had any friends or colleagues for the last year or so. I can't socialize, i can't be among other people, all i do is read all day long and now i don't even have the energy for that.

I have so much debt that they'll take away my grandma's house, and what i get from my pension is not enough to pay rent and feed myself here in my country/city. I can't live like this, I can't continue with life now that I am all alone and about to become homeless, it's too much!"
Omnicient_bat,2022-01-17 16:58:34+00:00,Life goes on,"**TLDR: life does get better**
This is a long one by the way

Tw: mentions of ed, sh, suicidal thoughts, psychosis, and a shitty mom :)

I’ve been on just about every depression sub and life has honestly sucked. My family is and has always been shit towards me. My parents (45f and 42m) had 3 kids, (15f, 14m, 10f) me being the oldest. Both mom and dad had a kid from a past relationship. Mom: 30 yr old son (this is a complicated story, yes she’s only 16 years older than him)
Dad: 21 yr old daughter (when she had her baby I decided there was no way in hell that I was gonna commit suicide, that lil niece of mine saved my life) 
I say I’m the oldest because those two never really lived with us, and we never really saw them, we were in a different state. My parents got divorced when I was 8, and immediately jumped into other relationships, my mom is now married to my stepdad (46m) He has 3 kids from a previous relationship, the youngest being 22, and him and my mom had a baby, she’s 3. I love that kid more than life itself, and there was no way on earth I was leaving her. Throughout my life, my mom has been awful towards me. She’s kicked me out more than I could count, stolen from me (large amounts, well, however much I had at that time so 300+ every other month or so) she’s made me miserable to say the least. My mom and stepdad don’t let me see my dad, which hurts more than you could imagine. They promised me a car when I turned 16 and that’s been the deal since I was 11 (they bought a half a million dollar house, and run a million dollar a year company for a little info). Which with my mom constantly taking my money, and not allowing me to get a job, was great because otherwise I was stuck. I started high school, got in a bad relationship or 4. Had to stop going to school due to an ex of mine and that whole situation. Multiple suicide attempts, self harm, eating disorder, psychosis episodes (TERRIFYING I would rather go through anything than this again) 
And anyways. Life is better. I’m back in school, and yeah everyone stares at me and whispers about me (a lot of rumors got spread so barely anyone likes me) and ppl usually get ushered away from me by their friends, but I don’t care. I’m 16 in 47 days, I have a motorcycle, she’s a 2004 Harley sportster (thank you dad I love you sm this is motorcycle is my baby), bc of my states work laws I’m getting a job after I turn 16, and then I’m planning on moving out of my moms within the next 6 months :). Granted I’m moving in with my stepbrother but that’s still an amazing step up and out of the house. He’s a cool person. I haven’t self harmed since September of 2021, I’m trying to eat better, I’m doing better. And I never thought I’d be able to say that and be honest."
goosedefender,2022-01-17 15:48:42+00:00,I feel like a failure,"I’m 23. I can’t drive. I’m broke. I’m graduating from college this spring two years later than all my peers because I switched majors 3 times and severely struggle with my mental health. No close friends. Currently unemployed while I go to school full time and am living off my parents, which I feel so incredibly guilty for, even though they reassure me it’s ok for the time being. 

I know the reason I’m so behind is because my anxiety is so intense and I’m in the process of finding a therapist. My anxiety has made it so hard to even make that step of making a simple phone call. It paralyzes me. 

I’m so embarrassed. I feel pathetic. All my peers have jobs, their own places, are financially stable, getting married, or at least have very clear goals in mind. I have none of those. I see people online all the time say “imagine not driving at this age”, or other rhetoric about how I’m essentially considered a complete loser. 

I know it’s not too late but it feels that way. I feel like such a failure. And I don’t deserve pity, because so many people have it so much worse. 

I’m such a f*ck up."

SH/MENTAL HOSPITAL,"And the psych ward says there is no need to worry this asylum was built to help you and just like the straps on the stretcher that you rolled in on, we are going to keep you safe and secured. Notice the locked doors and all the cameras perched in the corners like hawks. We will be watching. But this is all for you and your well-being. You are sick, anxious, depressed, a danger to yourself. The state told us to hold you for 72 hours but if you sign this paper, we can pretend your stay here this weekend is voluntary. Friday morning, you will be woken up by strangers in white coats and clipboards. You will be asked again and again and again about why and how you want to kill yourself. Be honest. Remember, you are only here for three days, so take advantage of the five to ten minutes you have with the doctors, but understand, he has a list of patients as long as his pay stubs, so you won’t be receiving any actual therapy sessions while you’re here, but we will recommend them as treatment for after we let you out. Until then, we want you to be comfortable,so sit back, enjoy the plastic furniture and coloring books. We have old radios with no antennae but the static is still loud enough to drown out the sound of the woman screaming in 2B. That’s just Cindy. She just does that sometimes. Well,she didn’t always but she does now and until we can find the right medication we are going to keep helping her, just like we want to keep helping you if only you’d let us.It's friday morning and you still haven't even tried the meds yet! Your still lying to us about holding a knife to your arm, like your parents haven't already told us everything, just be honest and let us help you! Did I mention that the state only recognizes the existence of psychiatric patients monday through friday, meaning the past 48 hours you spent here didn't even count, meaning we still have time for a break through or a breakdown, this is a good thing this means we still have time to help you, and I can see that you're getting upset but do not walk away from me with tears streaming and knuckles buried in palms, that type of body language is aggressive and we might have to do something about that a sedative maybe dishpan, perhaps I don't think being alone is best for you right now! Maybe you should spend time with the other patients, get to know how they got here, listen to them when they tell you that you got lucky getting  placed in THIS psych ward. We are one of the good ones! And we want you to stay here, we figure if we keep you long enough maybe eventually you will start to fit in, or maybe if we keep you locked up you'll eventually start to act out and we will be right here waiting to prescribe you something to label you with the diagnosis! ""We didn't cause your social anxiety, we only heightened what was already there, we just want to see you reach your full potential as a patient. We told you this asylum was built to help you."""

i am feeling depressed and i hate my life. my episodes are getting worse. 
i hate my parents, i never felt loved
maybe that's the reason why i crave for intimacy. i want someone's touch. someone to tell me what am i, what do i feel like, what is loveable about me. i crave for intimacy. i want to feel things physically. i hate my mind all i want is to feel something so hard or powerful that it will leave my mind blank. 

so that i could rest somehow. i could stop thinking. i could stop feeling other than feeling sad. i want to feel wanted. like every inch of me is the most important thing in this world. i want someone to feel like nothing is the same without me. that i am a precious thing. that they could never live without me. i want to be someone's oxygen.

i am so sick of feeling neglected. so sick of feeling angry and sad. i am so sick of living with parents who did not love each other so they end up fucking things up. 

i only want to feel someone to love me, hold me, fuck me or something.
just... make me feel something."
dbhsimp,2022-01-17 07:55:29+00:00,Letting emptiness take over,"I wrote this poem and I thought I’d share it. It’s nothing serious but it feels good to talk about it. 


Emptiness seems like the only option
I’m not sure how I got here 
Maybe I gave too much of myself 
Even though I had nothing left to give 
Or maybe because no one wants me 
And I want the ones that don’t see me
The strings won’t attach 
Those strings that connected me to the deepest parts of people 
Are now thin and frayed 
So I walk my days aimlessly 
and I let the emptiness take control 
It’s just easier that way
Unlike sadness, which weakens your limbs
The emptiness clears your mind 
Lets you trek on into nothing 

The Nothing is better than pain 
They say it’s better to feel pain than nothing at all 
But I disagree 
How do they know what’s better for me 
All the pain does is tear me apart 
With emptiness, I don’t have to cry 
I don’t have to think 
I can do my homework 
I can exercise 
And my mind will be completely blank
Numb 
I feel so good 
Like someone crawled through my window at night 
And stole my once anxious, rapidly beating  heart out of my chest 
Or slipped me a pill that dulled my every worst 
Now there is only silence 
It’s easier than fighting with myself 
And I know what you’re thinking
But if my personality suffers 
And I lose myself a bit 
I don’t think I care right now 
Because I’m not disappointing anyone this way 
I’ll do whatever they want 
The emptiness can make you do anything you need

To feel nothing 
is so completely relaxing and freeing 
As sad as it is 
I think I’ll stay like this for awhile"

I realize that I have been thinking suicide since I was 6 y/o, I believe what triggered this though is the fact that I suffered from sexual abuse and have been feeling guilty since then but why do I have to think about suicide every goddamn single day? I watch the human race and see nothing worthy and I sometimes just don't get those who are or at least pretend to be happy and continue with their lives, I am not even sure if people just pretend they're happy while they watch how everything is collapsing and just choose to ignore everything that is wrong with the world. I try really hard to even get out of bed every morning but it hasn't come a day where I feel truly happy, I guess I lost the skill to be happy, I just don't get it. I don't know why I am still here, yet I continue living in auto pilot just because I have not find the courage to end it. I don't get it."

I’m proud of myself for sticking it through for so long but I can’t believe i finally feel ok like it’s such a weird feeling. 

Hopefully now that I’m out of it I can do better this upcoming semester bc my depression really fucked up my motivation and my ability to retain information which in turn has messed up my grades.

I'm just worried about my future. I can't live on my own because I just don't make enough, even though I work full time.

 Recently i went trough something, or just gave up.
I feel peace inside when i think about it, everything just stops and toughts flow by without noticing.
 I have been a bad person all my life, did bad things.
Non violent ofcourse, but i feel like i made people suffer emotionally.
Lied to my parents, used my family and just ignored the norms of normal human nature.
I wanted to be and understand as deep as possible, and here i am.
I see that nothing matters, after everything there will be nothing but memories. And that's it.
We have no real purpose, just like some parasites reproduce.
Also i dont want to be in a world like this, everyday i have to go to work and see people for who they are, listen and observe. There is no fairness, they judge and act on the judgement. It's sickening to continue. I dont need drugs or help, im fully aware of the state im in, and i just dont wanna waste a minute here.
Would do it if i could. But id be a coward, to make people suffer more. I know there is people who care. I care for them. But i just see everything diffrent, it is painfull to not know why am i like this. Or it is painfull i digged so deep. Just uhhhh.. i wanna be a slave and live a miserable life. Pain is duty , better than joy. 
But when joy comes, it is better than sadness..
Anyways, im in control of me , and what? What now.

So me n my girlfriend broke up literally December 31 right before New Years and it was a mutual we just grew apart but it still hurt so my friend wanted me to go to this big party somebody he knew was throwing so I went thinking it would be good too take my mind off things. And it was alright at first but later into the night I was a little drunk n me n this one girl were talking going good then started making out. Then her boyfriend I guess he was came up n literally got in between us n started yelling n cursing at me n I started yelling n cursing back then he pushed me n I pushed him back real hard n he fell n busted his ass then the girl I was kissing rushed him out while he kept yelling at me. So I went back to partying after a lil n then about 2 hours later I started getting ready to leave. N so I’m walking to my car n I went to put my hands in my pocket for my key and just get rammed from behind. The guy hit me with his car and had both my legs pinned in between our cars. I immediately just fell when he reversed then he just yelled out the window n sped off. I woke up the next day with some metal thing around one leg and a full leg cast on the other and shit just keeps getting worse feels like life is saying fuck you n I don’t have anyone to talk to n can’t do shit on my own feel so helpless. And the guy was never found so the police couldn’t do much."

No  matter how full and hurting my stomach is, or how much time I spend  creating scenarios in my head, nothing fills the fissure I have inside  me.

Loneliness is certainly  lethal, but at a veeery small pace. It slowly kills your ability to  socialize, to talk, to focus, to dream, to see a future. It blinds you  one day at a time and makes you think this is all there is."

The second Time I came out I felt like I had no support(which is currently) like it feels like everyone gave up one me even though I know they didn't. I just dont feel like I have any support.

So...i guess this is goodbye, it's been a rough few days. I'm hungry, i smell bad, I ran out of money and I am running out of supplyes. I've been ignored and humiliated and I've decided to end this reality for good! 

I won't bore you with my story, i've long decided that it's my prerogative that history forgets me and my name become lost among the unimaginably high number of homeless suicides that plague this green earth and that my body be used to further develop scientific research by being donated to my alma mater university. 

Suffice to know that i'm a victim of debt and neglect in a country that has seen the number of empovirished citizens sky rocket since our president took over and covid arived. I had it all and I lost it all by falling victim to an economic system that cares more about the profits of a few wealthy bankers than the well being of it's youth, a system which allows only a handfull of privileged people to prosper while the majority has to survive with scraps and crumbs. 

Truth be said, even when I had a roof over my head, i was never happy, my mind has always choosen to play it's tricks bringing me every day one step closer to the decision I took today. Happiness is just a foreign, almost alien, concept for me, i've lost too much, and felt too little. Now that i find myself in this situation, all i feel is the hopeless, meaningless truth of life, that it's devoided of any inherent meaning. 

I've made my peace with my fate, and while i don't know what force pushes me towards writing this, I have to say that I wish peace and happiness upon all of you, you're all amazing people in this community and it helped me through the toughest times, be kind to one another, love each other, help each other as much as you can and always remember.

ecchittebane,2022-01-15 12:04:01+00:00,I've wasted my life,"Lately I've felt like I've wasted my life and the opportunities given to me and ended up in a place where I don't want to be. I don't know if anyone feels the same of has been through something similar. I guess I just wanna rant somewhere, I feel like I've bothered my friends enough and don't wanna make them upset.

To provide some background I come from a family where everyone suffers from mental health problems. My mom and brother both have schitzofrenia and me and my dad are simply anxious wrecks since we were the pillars of our family, keeping everything together when my mom and brother would have their psychotic episodes. 

I've been to therapy and tried to live my own life but now I've ended up doing a job I'm not good at and don't enjoy. I've studied twice and recently graduated but I feel like I've failed since I haven't been able to choose a career that brings me joy and that I'm able to do without breaking my mental health. I've always wanted to do something to help other people but recently I've realized maybe I'm not good enough at dealing with people to do that. I'm pretty anxious around people and hate conflicts and I don't like to be in charge and lead other people. I just like to do my own thing and the job that I currently do requires constant negotiation with others. 

I just wish I'd have more time to get to know myself better when growing up and not choose paths that clearly weren't for me. I was good at school so I feel like I had all the means to study something that'd make me happy and get a job that I'd be better suited to.

Tldr; I ended up choosing a career that I'm not good at and that I don't enjoy, now I feel like I've wasted my life."

Recently, my friends have been out if school a lot due to things like road trips, covid etc. Without my friends there, I'm actually left alone with my thoughts and I have way too much time to think about what's stressing me.

School is basically hell when I'm trying to balance my depression, demotivation, and self harm along with the fact that I have to turn in school work. Things have been pissing me off more than usual and it's a lot easier to annoy me these days.

I haven't been doing any work because I spend entire class periods thinking of literally everything that stresses me out.

They live out of town now, so we only see each other every couple of months when they’re back in town. Here’s the problem, if I don’t initiate the conversation with them, we never talk. If I didn’t text first we would probably go months without talking. It also  takes forever for them to reply. I understand that people have lives, jobs, school, and plenty of others things to be consumed by. I’m not saying I expect a text from them everyday or even every week, I just don’t want to feel like I’m the only one putting effort into the friendship. I’m not the type of person that can go from seeing someone all the time to no contact. This has been a problem for the past couple of years (since they moved) and I’ve even brought this problem up to them several times. Should I bring this issue up again? Should I stop trying to contact them? Am i just too clingy?Is it normal for friends to not keep in touch?"

  Right now im in Netherlands. For 5 months, haven't seen my family. Sometime back i realised i have depression, and i guess you cant threat it in one day.
Really making me weak and unfocused, making many mistakes at my work. Afraid of getting fired.
   Would go back but, not a single penny saved.
And some debt left, im really scared , panicked and just dreadfull past week. Fighting it as best as i can, wont give up.
  But any ideas how can i get out of this situation? Maybe good work places, or something.
With the salary i have now it will be a while.
Also very lonely, i have friends but they just dont get it. Cant socialize for some reason.
It's hard, honestly. 
Also the stress, i dont get it why am i so sensitive to everything, the smallest thing can make my mood go down. Went to the doctor, 1 min he says im ok. Wtf?
This world seems so cold. Depression is just a whole lot a reality.
Also im deperesonlizing from fighting so hard back, it likes throwing rocks at me. Mf in my head

After covid I started having a lot more symptoms. During the past 18 months I lost my childhood best friend to overdose and my grandma to breast cancer. I have no motivation or energy for anything. it all feels pointless. I’m in my last year of university but I have no idea how i’m going to pass my classes because i have no desire to do anything and most days I can’t even get out of bed. I’ve seen psychiatrist and doctor for these issues. I’ve been taking zoloft for almost a month and ativan for panic attacks but I still feel as hopeless as i did before. Today was the first day I self harmed in almost a year. I had planned to take a few sleeping pills and drown in the bathtub but I couldn’t go through with it. I feel like my life has gone completely off track and I don’t have the energy to even begin to fix it. I feel so disconnected from myself and everyone around me. My parents are trying to be supportive but my mom has a tendency to make these things about herself and my dad can be overbearing. they don’t understand why I’m just not getting better. I wish I knew. When I can i try and do things like go for walks but i feel so numb towards everything. I had so many hopes and goals for my future that now seem impossible. I really don’t understand the point in anything. Even the most simple tasks seem like an impossible burden.

mourabtw,2022-01-13 21:50:13+00:00,I want to die,"I think I have legitimately found myself in a shitty situation.

Every time I look back at life and what I've been doing for years (studying) I think it doesn't have a purpose.

I feel that life is pointless and there is no actual difference between a person who studies and a homeless people, because we all eventually die and everything becomes worthless, memories are lost, etc.

Also the fact that I'm socially deprived and \*partially\* addicted to video games (due to the fact that I have 0 real friends) is making me feel like a big piece of shit that doesn't deserve to live (because I'm not enjoying life ""the way"" I should be).

Maybe my way of enjoying life is doing what I do, but people don't seem to get that, which makes them see me as some sort of loser that sits around in his house all day long (which is in fact true).

I don't know what to do and I don't find anything meaningful in life that makes me keep going.

The one time I loved someone and cared just enough for it to be a reason for me to be alive, that person ended up disappointing me, which also made me question my self-worth (since this happened i've tried killing myself several times).

I think I need help (even though probably there's nothing I can do to change the fact that life is vague and everything is truly pointless) and more so, a hug, any kind of affection (saying this is really hypocrite from me, since I tend to be a shitty dude that doesn't really show much of his feelings).

I feel overwhelmed all the time and I feel like this sense of overwhelm is also pointless.

I feel that everything is pointless (wow I've over-used pointless, that begs the question doesn't it) and this feeling ""tells"" me that I shouldn't exist, so I'm thinking of a way of killing myself (without failure).

Anyways, I really do know that this post is going to get downvoted to hell, since people love to shit on ""nerds"" like me, and they don't really care about us, but it is something I'm used to.

I feel like this anonymous way of telling to other people what is really happening in my life is a good way to find someone to talk to about this issue of mine."

On Valentines day suddenly guys decided to surprise girls in their class by giving rose to each of them. When turn came to me,they had run out of flowers and said sorry we forgot about you. By the time I was already so used to for shit happening to me that I just said OK. I'm fairly stoic by nature and had shitty childhood. But that hurt. I have always been a fat girl and still am but I'm sure I look like a female,so ""forgetting about me"" was just cruel. And another shittiest thing was that these guys were truly nice guys if I compare them to my other classmates in the past. Even they didn't give shit about me. Here I am more than decade later still lonely and see no point losing my weight. I have done that before and still look below average."
8Kaleidoscope_eyes,2022-01-13 18:32:35+00:00,11 weeks Prego and nervous about switch from Wellbutrin to Prozac,"So like I said... I am pregnant. I have been on Wellbutrin 300 xr for about 7 years and it doesn't seem to be working anymore for a long while now. My OB suggested Prozac and my mom has been on Prozac for a very long time and it works super well for her and my grandfather also.

 I am so nervous that I am going to have negative side effects from tapering and taking the lowest dose of Prozac. It seems like the typical starting dose is 20 mg and they have me starting on 10 mg. Does anyone have experience with this? I just don't want to get really depressed from tapering and then the Prozac not really doing much at 10 mg. 

 This is my taper plan.

Starting today
1st week - 150 Wellbutrin (half the dose I was on)

2nd week - 150 Wellbutrin + 10 mg Prozac

3rd week - Stop Wellbutrin and 10 mg Prozac and then a follow up appointment."

Dragonfly_515,2022-01-13 18:01:29+00:00,Having to trust those around me,It’s been a month and two days since my attempt was not successful. I am still in therapy and working on my meds yet again. It just takes so much energy to live. But I am trusting those around me. They say it’ll get better. Not in that well meaning off handed way but actually mean it. Life will always be hard and it’ll always be work. But they say if I trust them and don’t let my own mind be in control I will get to the break in the clouds. Right now I don’t want to kill myself. That would take too much energy. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. So I am trusting them. I am trusting them.

Well_okay_i_guess_,2022-01-12 20:50:17+00:00,Made a suicide pact today,"I've been in group therapy since last year, i'm currently in a different therapy group but I met a girl in my last group with whom i really connected. 
We're both struggling with suicidal tendencies so we understood eachother pretty well, we were worried about eachother and wanted to make sure each of us stays safe while on the other hand obviously wanting to die.

She got admitted to a mental hospital a few weeks ago after an attempt and i've tried to visit as much as possible, today while we were taking a walk we talked about how much we both wanted to die, she mentioned she had something she wanted to say but was kinda scared to say. Eventually i got her to speak her mind and she told me that if we were gonna kill ourselves if we could do it together. I agreed, and we promised eachother we wouldn't attempt it again untill we were both ready to end it together. We happily made plans to book a luxurious hotel, eat, drink and just enjoy ourselves and then we'd OD and i guess die together. 

I know people will say that it's a bad idea and suicide isn't the answer but that's not why i shared it here, actually i'm not sure why i shared but hey here we are."

It's like I dont even exist at school. I didnt talk to anyone today. No one. Not even my teachers. And it wasnt intentionally! I dont have any friends there besides for one guy who already is getting bored of me. I think it's just been my fault. You know those annoying people who you dont like hanging around because they have no self awareness or are constantly talking about themselves? I think that's me. I didnt talk to anyone, because I always feel like I'm a nuisance when I do.

And I thought I was doing hell-- recovering from my eating disorder, I was taking my meds regularly, I even got two weeks to get better and take time for myself. And you know what? I've been crying constantly. 

I'm just so, so tired. I dont want to vent or rant to anyone, because I know I'm already a burden. I don't think anyone really cares for my issues at this point, and fair enough. I just wish someone did. I wish someone could tell me I'm not stupid and that people like being around me. That maybe I'm more useful than I feel like. 

Just so tired of being obsessed with myself and all these problems. I wish I could get out of the hotel I've dug myself in. I just want friends and to be smart and happy like everybody else seems to be. I know it's not happiness all the time, but I wish I had something to strive for.

There’s nothing no one can tell me at this point that I haven’t realized myself or have heard from other people. Sharing doesn’t help. It just makes me feel like I’m bothering people because there’s nothing they can say or do for me. Having anxiety on top of depression doesn’t help. I haven’t been able to sleep.

The only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I’m petty as fuck and I don’t want people who’ve looked down on me have that satisfaction.

221b97,2022-01-12 12:48:30+00:00,I just want to vent so this is long,"I’m 24 (M) and I have felt depressed for many years and right now I’m at my lowest, Unemployed, Epilepsy and a shit Memory

. I recently moved to London in November to start a new job and hopefully a new life. The job wasn’t for me and the people I worked for were very unsupportive and harsh. This lead to me being let go at the end of December during which time I had Covid. 

The first house I moved into was a warehouse that was cold, depressing and dirty. I lived with three other girls who I wouldn’t see much. Everyday I would go to work, come home and sit in my room watching TV until I went to sleep. The only people I saw were my work colleagues which most probably lead to being unprofessional at work. 

For two weeks I had a noose tied to my bed frame made from a long extension lead… I guess this was just a way of me letting myself know that there was a way out if I needed it.

I have just moved house again which is actually a very pleasant household but being unemployed along with my depression has made it hard to motivate myself.

I think my depression stemmed from my parents break up which lasted from 11-14. I am the oldest of three, my other two siblings went through this as well but I feel as though I took the brunt of it. After years of unrest and a bad relationship with my mum. She was and still is a hoarder and dealing with this made me feel very unstable, which lead to me being a disruptive and rebellious teenager.

I then moved out and lived with my dad in a flat. At first it was good but he then started another emotionally abusive relationship which I was again in the middle of. I then moved out and lived with my grandparents for a bit which was a better environment but I felt very isolated.

At the same time as all of the problems at home I was being bullied at school… I think the majority of it was banter but due to the stresses of home I was very emotional which made me an easy target. 

During year 9 aged 14 I moved schools to get away from the bullying. This was good but an hour commute there and back was tiring. The change in school was a good move as I wasn’t being bullied anymore. 

After a few months at my grandparents I moved back in with my mum as my dad had left and moved to Stoke on-trent… again this was hard as I had a lot of resentment towards her and her inability to sort the house out. I know she loves me but as a person she finds it hard to express her emotions so I was never told by her that she loved me or shown any physical affection. 

When I reached 18 and with terrible grades I managed to convince a local university to take me on and I moved out into student accommodation. 

The three years spent at university was probably some of the best I’ve had, although I was drinking excessively which certainly didn’t help towards my mental health. 

University finished and from there I moved in with my aunt and uncle until I found a job and a shared house to move into. Living with them was amazing, it was a taste of what a real family environment should be like and being there finally made me feel at home.

I finally found a job working in events for a company that ran events, owned a venue and held a festival so I moved out. I was their Events Manager and Head of Decor for their festival. At the same time I worked as an artist manager and tour manager for several artists.

2019 was an amazing year but running weekly events and 8 festivals took their toll. I was drinking most nights and doing drugs constantly at all events I ran. During this time I was having blackouts and memory loss during the day, suddenly I was in the office and then I was outside and I had no recollection of walking out…

At the end of the summer after a 3 day bender I had a grand mal seizure. After speaking to the doctors they concluded that I had been having partial seizures all summer and at least two a day.

Suddenly I had epilepsy, my driving licence revoked and thrown into an even deeper pit of depression.

All my life I have had intrusive thoughts and a voice in my head constantly telling me to kill myself. After talking to a therapist she concluded that I had OCD.

Here is a note I wrote during 2020

*“I feel so alone and it’s probably due to my epilepsy along with a few other things…* 

*I feel like no one checks up on me especially my own family (apart from one friend), I look back through texts and it seems to be only me contacting them first and if it’s not it’s normally to ask me for something or to talk about stuff relating to future plans. Which is ok but I just wish people would ask me how I am.* 

*I have been using alcohol and drugs as an escape even though I know they increase my chances of seizures. I tell my friends that it’s ok and that I am fine to take certain ones but I know deep down they’re all bad for me. I constantly say I’m going to quit stuff but I don’t and feel like I’m in a constant loop of self destruction.*

*I live in the same city I grew up in and went to uni in which makes me upset as I want to leave but I haven’t sat down and had the motivation to do it. I don’t know if this is because I feel down or I want to be self destructive?* 

*I live in a shared house where everyone seems to be against one another which is hard as I feel like I’m stepping on eggshells constantly.* 

*I don’t have a permanent home where I can go back to for a night or even for dinner with family because my mum is a hoarder so won’t let me. The house also brings back awful memories and stresses me out if I go there, especially the state it is in now. My dad lives in Stoke on Trent and thinks that if I have a night at his I will argue.* 

*I haven’t spent any proper time with my close family for years and I don’t think that will ever change.*

*I feel like I can’t read a room or a situation and always overstep the mark… it’s only when I lose friends or get ignored by them do I realise I’ve done something wrong.*

*I’m looking for a way out and I constantly tell myself to kill myself, both out loud and in my head. I know this isn’t the solution and would ruin my family.* 

*The one person I hate the most is myself and I’d do anything to get rid of him.”*

Here is another - just of a few intrusions I wrote down

* *23rd December 2020 - standing the shower wanting to kill myself over stupid thoughts... I got really drunk the night before so probably doesn’t help*
* *24th - calling myself a twat and wanting to kill myself whilst in the shower, physical cringe*

*""You have until the end of January to sort this out otherwise you need to end it.""*

I worked from home for 18 months during the pandemic and that only made things worse.

After a long period of stagnation in my life and career I decided to move to London thinking that moving away would sort out my problems.. They have only followed me and have most probably gotten worse because of it.

I have missed out a lot of problems and periods in my life but I think these are my main ones. 

I feel very hopeless right now and am on the edge of suicide. I sort of wanted to post this as a way of expressing my feelings and potentially a way to heal myself. Above all this could be my note."

The sun is shining, the leaves are a cascade of the usual fall colors, and there's that slight chill in the air that serves as a gentle reminder that winter is indeed coming. You're laying on the couch, having enjoyed a lazy day off from life's many obligations, but now you can't help but count the seconds on the clock as they tick away. It's agonizing and you know it, but still you can't help yourself as your anticipation builds. The time you're waiting for is getting closer… and closer… 

Then you hear the sound of a key in the front door and your ears prick up. The door is pushed open and your heart leaps just as your body does. The love of your life has finally returned after a day that was beginning to feel like it would never end. You crash into each other and both squeeze so hard, you wouldn't be surprised if you pop like one of those stress relief dummies. The hug has probably gone on long enough, but you refuse to let go partially afraid that they might disappear if you aren't holding them. You fight back tears of joy because even though you never thought it was possible, you just know they feel the same way about you.

Finally you pull back just enough in order to kiss them softly, conveying more thoughts and feelings and sheer love for them than words ever could. After a few seconds you let up, unable to fight it any longer. A single rogue tear finally escapes and rolls free down your face. Your heart soars as you see your partner smile, struggling to hold back tears of their own. They were just as enthusiastic to see you. Another tear threatens to escape your confines. ""Don't cry baby, you're gonna make me cry too,'' they say, wiping the tears that had escaped your defenses away. You hold hands and look lovingly into each other's eyes, baring your souls for one another. The two of you weren't normally this sappy, but it seemed to just be one of those days, and damn it, you were glad it was. 

""I couldn't wait for you to get home,"" you tell them, pulling them down to the couch. The two of you shift into your natural cuddling position as you have so many times before. You both sigh and lay there in silence for a while. Eventually, time would demand you get up and do things, but you knew if you had the option, you could lay there with your soul mate for eternity, and be in a state of bliss the entire time. 

""I'm so lucky to have you,"" you say softly, breaching the comfort of silence. ""If I had to do it all over, I'd gladly go through all the heartache again. Because it led me to you; and there's no one else I'd rather give my heart to in the whole wide world,"" they say lovingly. ""I love you,"" you say. ""I love you too,"" they respond. You both adjust and lightly kiss each other again. 

""I am getting hungry however, so how about we make something?"" They suggest. ""That sounds great,"" you reply, entirely on board with the idea. Regardless if you were good at it or not, making something together was a great way to spend time with each other, and that's the only thing you wanted to do after your time apart. ""What should we make, Chicken?"" They ask. ""Not feeling that, Pasta?"" You counter. ""We just had that last night. Oh, I know! How about we be naughty and have cookies for dinner,"" they say, eyebrows raised. You chuckle and boop them on the nose. Just another example of why you love them with all your heart. ""Alright, it's a plan, but I get to use the cookie cutter this time,"" you say as you both get up. ""Nah, first one there gets that honor loser!"" They say, laughing as they sprint into the kitchen. 

You smile and think back to all the days and nights where the loneliness seemed to be too much. You had some dark thoughts those days. Sometimes the darkest one of all. You never thought in a million years you'd find someone who would actually love you as you did them. You were glad you persevered even when you didn't know why you kept going. You thought back to what they had said earlier as you followed them into the kitchen. If you had to do it all again, you gladly would. Because it led you to them, and there was no one you'd rather share your heart with in the whole wide world.

---

Even though it doesn't seem like it will ever happen, it is possible. I'm in the same boat as you. Just keep going and keep trying new things, even if you don't know why you're still fighting. You never know when your life will change for the better."
Throwawayyuh3,2022-01-11 23:12:33+00:00,I don't feel good.,"My thoughts are clouded, I can't stop thinking about the cuts on my wrist. It's so hard to focus on things when I know what's under my sleeve. All it takes is one slip up and then EVERYBODY knows what I do to myself.

I'm scared to tell people. The people around me don't know how to console someone going through depression. Everybody thinks of me as the guy who could never be depressed. I don't even know how they'd react if I had depression.

I also feel kinda sick. My head hurts, my hands are cold, and my hands keep shaking slightly. I don't know if the shaking is from the blood loss but it doesn't feel good either way.

I honestly don't know how long I'll be able to keep up this happy image of myself. I'm so mentally exhausted and school isn't doing any fucking favors. 

Focusing in school is damn near impossible when the only thing I can think about is all the bodily harm I'm causing myself. I am going to try and make better choices, but don't count on it. Goodbye, have a nice day."

Expensive-Election-5,2022-01-11 21:35:36+00:00,Just a bad state of mind,"Despite how I appear to so many folks around me at work and such, I've gone hollow inside. I put my energy into each of my shifts (I work 7 days a week between two jobs) and I put on a bit of an act that I'm fine to try to make things go fast. 

Yet I'm so clocked out of life. I'm a month from 30 and I just think, ""Well I'll be out of debt, then what?"" 

""I could try to meet someone again, but I won't be able to trust them.""

My ex (I know this is a buzz word these days) is a narcissist. For 5 years, due to my own unhealed traumas and sense of dysfunction, I put up with her abusive behavior. Despite how bad things could get, she was my everything. She would walk into a room and I would be so happy to see her. She left two days before I was about to buy the engagement ring and a month before I was set to get on one knee. The breakup was sudden and extremely nasty especially a month after.

Since then there's been no contact and to be honest, I don't think I've been remotely the same. I don't play video games anymore despite loving them, I sit in silence most days, I used to love keeping my place clean, now it's fallen to a mess. My cats try to give me love and I'll play a bit, but they're just kind of there now. Don't get me wrong, they're still taken care of very well, heck better than I take care of myself.

I just wish a bomb would drop or something. I want to stop missing her. I want to stop feeling this immense pit and immense exhaustion, yet it doesn't seem to be remotely closer to being done than it did when it all started 9 months ago."

I'm failing online now and i am trying to salvage my core credits for highschool. I'm a 300 pound male at 16. I don't look amazing but I'm acceptable. I've become very out of shape since covid, i did gym for like 3 years but the depression is still there. Its hard to exercise in a place with winter and I'm 1 hour away from the nearest gym. I'm constantly either too hot or too cold, i also have flat feet so running is a bitch. it gets harder to find clothing I'm comfortable in.

Air_sick,2022-01-11 17:22:34+00:00,Every time i begin dating again i loose all energi,"Over the last 10 years i spent 2x4 years in  relationships. The first involved psychological abusive and the second we both had our mental problems to deal with. I have now been single for a year and have started dating again, however the same thing happens with each person i meet; it is exciting in the chatting phase but soon after first meet up, i need almost an entire day of recovering my mental energi. Soon after i get second thoughts and back out of the entire thing again. 

I have struggled with depression the last couple of years, but i am off meds and not seeing a psychologist anymore since i am feeling better. I still get anxiety attacks from time to time but much more rare now, yet meeting people through dating seem to provoke anxiety attacks and make me distance myself from dating. 

Anyone else experience stuff like this?"

I don’t see a purpose in my life I don’t have anything. I don’t have friends that I can hang out with or spend time with because they’re dead or just gone, I don’t have a family, I don’t even have a dog.

I just put like 10 cuts into my skin and they bleed so much more. I wiped away the blood with a tissue at least 4 times, but the blood always starts flowing again.

I'm bleeding so much that you can see it through my sleeve. All of the cuts burn and moving my arm too much irritates them. I have a total of 28 scars on my left arm, I don't know how long I can hide them. Goodbye, have a nice day."

stupidlittleidiot69,2022-01-11 14:19:41+00:00,just need a long vent,"Got addicted to mary jane last year during the lockdowns we had. Well, now here I am at my worst. I’m absolutely drained. I don’t think it’s physically possible for me to continue living anymore. 

For the past 2 years I’ve been studying full-time while caring for/ basically parenting my partner who has BPD. She was only medicated and diagnosed recently but my mental health has suffered so much. Of course I did it out of genuine love but right now I am having a hard time feeling like anybody loves or appreciates me. 

I’m the one who cleans the dishes. I’m the one who cooks. I do the laundry. I do the groceries. I have been paying for everything except her half of the rent, this entire year. I drained my savings. But I understand. She couldn’t find a job due to the lockdowns, and she always talked about feeling guilty. I guess right now, I’m just at my breaking point. I’m exhausted after being her therapist and parent for this entire time. I need to remind her to eat, brush her teeth, shower, take her meds, call dr for her prescription etc. I’m tired from not receiving much back for the hours, days, months of time I have devoted in order to keep her alive and well. I’m also tired and hurt that I’ve been forced into this role as her caregiver over time. Feels more like I’m just here to do everything for her rather than a romantic relationship.

A huge thing at the moment is the fact that I’m unemployed (due to my previous job rostering me 3 hours per week out of nowhere) I’ve applied for 80+ jobs beginning on 10 December and I still haven’t been hired anywhere. I even applied for shit like mcdonalds, man. Somehow, I just keep failing in everything I do. I just want a job, so that I can afford to live. But at this point, it seems like that wont be possible.

Regardless of what I do, I’ll never be able to change the fact that I come from an impoverished family and that I will remain impoverished for most or all of my life. The health issues, lack of generational wealth, psychological illness and trauma I have endured as a result of being an impoverished child has cemented my future. 

I mean, look at me. I haven’t been able to make myself a meal in weeks. I simply cant afford anything that isn’t processed food, if I can afford anything at all. My parents income is still below the poverty line, my dad is sick with something life threatening so yeah absolutely no financial support there.

I’m fucked. I’m so fucking stupid for believing I could change the trajectory of my life by going to university. If only I had ended my life before enrolling, it wouldve saved me 2 years of intensive study and student debt. Because, being real, there’s no way out for me. I still need to sort out a new flat as my lease ends next month, i dont have the money to pay a bond because im fucking unemployed and there is nobody in my life who supports me financially. the most i can buy right now is a loaf of bread.

Can’t get government support as I’m a student and can only receive money while studying. My semester begins march 1.

So, here I am. I’ve done everything and more to try live a normal life, but it wasn’t enough. Saving money since I was employed at age 13 wasn’t enough. I’m 19 now. Working during full-time study wasn’t enough. Nothing I do will ever be enough. I will always be poor, I’ll always be starving, I’ll always be 1 inconvenience away from a panic attack because none of my basic needs are being met, I’m too busy stressing about whether or not I need to resort to prostitution in order to survive.

I just want to live. I don’t think I’ve ever lived, not in my entire life."

I remember when I was 8 y, I waked up and I felt sick, my mom came to my room and asked me to wake up, I told her that I’m sick and she just came to my bed and kicked me with her leg, she was yelling at me telling me that I got sick because I didn’t listen to her when she told me not to go outside while it was raining.

I have been going to a therapist not even for a year. My parents divorced when I was in second grade. I didn't understand it until 4th grade. I started crying every night and soon developed a self hate. From the divorce to now we have struggled with money. I can't help but give myself self hatred. I hate my body. I hate my personality. I hate myself. I stopped caring about myself. By 6th grade I was cutting my arms and had lost eveything good. Things just kept going downhill. I lately learned I have ADD (been tested), possible OCD, and anxiety (with anxiety attacks) . I have scars on my arms, I body shame myself in the mirror. I have no motivation and I can barely get up in the mornnings. People make me feel horrible when I get called ""lazy"" or that I can't do anything right. And it's true. If I'm being honest with you on this, I am in 7th grade. I'm hated for my sexaulity and I'm down to one real friend. I am suicidal and almost attempted and yet I cant help but wonder if all this was just an idea put in my head. I have constantly been forgotten about. My mom is an alcoholic and gambling addict who has two DUIs and can't save her money. She spent all of the birthday money my sister and I had (about 600 all together). I'm so tired of suffering, but is it not an actual mental illness? Am I putting this idea in my head? Someone please read this and help me."

mobileexplanation81,2022-01-11 02:45:43+00:00,Mental health has tanked over the last 6 months,"M(23). Let me preface that the last 3 years have been rough already. I was in the veterinary world for 2.5 years. I switched jobs in September to another clinic to get out of a toxic work environment. After I started there thinking that it was going to be great even though I took a pay cut, it went down hill quick. Micromanagement and wanting people to go home early, I wasn't making ends meet. In December I asked one of the receptionist at work out, thought that was going to be a good thing since I was already looking for a new job, well right after getting together with her my mental health tanked so hard and I have not recovered, maybe trauma from my last relationship I don't know. I got a job in construction right before Christmas thinking that old help since I would be out of the veterinary field (highest civilian suicide rate). It's true I had a close call right before I got my new job. Along side that in my personal life I have an alcoholic dad that got DUI (hasn't gone to court yet) and makes my home life hell, a close family member passed  right after Christmas and had an ER visit with my mother. I've tried everything medication and exercise. But I myself have a drinking problem since it's the only way I can go to sleep. A lot of little stuff has happened since then too and it just has added up so much with nothing good happening in return. I'm honestly at my breaking point, I've had the bad thoughts everyday since the beginning of December and broken down when I'm alone more than I've done in years. I'm losing my mind, I over think so much, replay so much, play the what if game so much. I don't feel anything but sadness and hopelessness now, everyday is a fight and I'm losing it quickly. I'm supposed to talk to my old therapist tomorrow and get an evaluation by a psychiatrist next week. I don't have much hope."

Throwawayyuh3,2022-01-11 02:00:02+00:00,I relapsed.,"I've avoided cutting for three months but I honestly can't keep doing it. Whenever I felt like I needed to cut, I would surround myself with people and make sure I was in a situation where I couldn't cut. 

It worked like a charm for a while, but avoiding the urge is not the same as completely getting rid of it. I'm looking down at these cuts and I honestly can't even believe I actually just relapsed.

The cuts really burn, I used an incredibly sharp knife to cut my skin because I have no razor blades. If I move my left arm to much, the cuts stretch and I can feel them all burn at once.

dark_elftress,2022-01-11 01:52:33+00:00,I’m not sure how to title this,"I’m lost. I feel that my feelings and emotions aren’t valid or I go unnoticed. I want to matter. From a mom that disregarded me, a father who’s a stranger, a dad who’s more of a stoner friend, an angry loving but guarded fiancé, and me. These are the relationships I ponder due to their respective issues and backgrounds. My mom who couldn’t put down the needle and be an actual mom, my father her ex dealer who’s old enough to be my grandpa, my dad who I love but he has many flaws that I’ve also had to handle, and my fiancé who at times makes it hard to have a social life by belittling me. 

And then there’s me. Insecure, anxiety filled, depressed, scared of almost everything. I’m scared of loosing everything as it falls out of my clutch. I cut my mother out since she has her own problems she can deal with herself. My father I’m not sure how to have a relationship with him. My dad I see him age as he bends over backwards for his wife. And my fiancé is a whole book in its own.

I have to take quite a few pills to even go through a normal day. Hell I have to take a pill 30 min before a shower just so I can take a shower. And that’s all to my anxiety. I can’t figure out a playlist in the shower to listen to so I stay calm so there’s that. I was abused while I would shower when I was a kid till I was 13 so now I take short cold showers. Short because of wasting water cold because I wasn’t allowed the luxury of a warm one.

Belowthe_Undertow,2022-01-10 21:53:57+00:00,Validity of Emotion,"Part of my depression is grappling with the idea that emotions are conditional. Something causes them and influences their nature. But I can never come to terms with the idea that my company can be enjoyable, much less preferable. I instead view my company in regards to tolerance. I conceptualize friends as people that tolerate me and offer pleasantries and courtesies through some sort of prolonged charitable gesture. I conceptualize romance as a ploy to wring from me what precious little benefits I can provide. I don't believe a person can be genuinely interested in me, instead pleasant interaction is simply pity, charity, or manipulation in disguise. 

The opinion that I hold of myself is terrible. My base assumption is that I deserve every terrible thing that happens to me and that any pleasant experience must be earned through hardship, pain, and/or misery. 

I've had crippling depression for years now. I hardly function. Often times I wonder if I deserve to be alive. In fact, one of the primary reasons I try to function at all is to spare myself from discomfort and boredom. 

Sometimes my anxiety gets the better of me and one of the ways I calm myself is by thinking of dying. I've had that coping mechanism since I was a child. I used to think ""If I die everything will be better. Any problems I cause, any discomfort or hardship brought on by my existence will just go away once I'm gone. Everyone will be happy and I won't have to worry about anything anymore.""

Of course, now I know better. But it still helps me to imagine things like dropping from tall buildings or leaning over the edges of high bridges."

today I discovered myself as the worst person in this world, I often get off and come back on Instagram. so, today I made a new Instagram account and started following people, some followed me back instantly, and others accepted my request but **didn't follow me back**. And I can sense they did intentionally as they don't value me.

The reason I can sort out of this is:

I was quite an extrovert who gossip a lot and just and so the bad stuff I did like writing bad about my friend's ex in comments on IG so her mutuals consider me enemy but they don't show when they talk to me in person.

I hate my past but my question:

Do I just don't give them fuck and unfollow and block them?!

mended_arrows,2022-01-10 11:51:12+00:00,Taking my first steps to getting health insurance for the first time since I turned 18.,"As we all know, life and the world are a lot. Now more so than ever it seems there is something new and terrible going on, and it is all on full display. I (32 now) have been self medicating since my mid teens because of long term, undiagnosed depression and anxiety symptoms. Because of this I have not managed to make any progress towards stability, no house, no savings, no retirement, a withering body, etc.. Pandemic life on top of everything else has caused what little energy and hope I may have felt to evaporate, and it has all hit critical mass.

Being creative has been my one source of contentment, even if in very small doses, and I have always worried that seeing a doctor would result in me losing that one thing that I like about myself, but I have an appointment to apply for Medicare today around 8:30 am. I am terrified. I haven’t kept records in all my 15 years of adulthood, haven’t kept up with taxes, can’t focus long enough to fill out simple paperwork. My life is a mess and I’m not sure how to responsibly articulate that to the people who’s help I desperately need. 

I don’t know why I am posting this, I just can’t sleep and feel sick to my stomach from nerves. I don’t live alone, but I always feel guilty when I wake my family. I need to change or I think I’m going to die of self neglect.

I hope all are being treated kindly by this day, and if not, find the strength to keep pushing toward tomorrow. Much love."

I've  known her for almost 1.5 years now but, because of Covid, and because  of my personality, I got to actually know her only in the past few  months. Earlier, she was often the one to initiate conversation and,  even though I like her, I still think I ""owe"" her something.

**I believe a strong friendship is the base to a genuine and durable relationship**,  however, I've just learned from one of her friends that she likes  another guy outside our class. Of course I respect her choices, but I  know I will still have to spend a lot of time with her. We see each  other almost every day, if not more. I don't really know what to do.

I don't know what to do because it seems impossible to like someone else as much as I like her; **big part of my mood used to depend on how well our friendship was going, and now I feel so hollow.**

Also,  the fact that I didn't know about this until someone else told me has  been disheartening, as I realized that I know very little about  relationships. In fact, I don't think I have many friends left, other  than her.

She probably doesn't  know her friend told me; although I've seen some signs, I don't know if  she likes me too. Actually, I don't even know if someone can like more  people at the same time.

What am I supposed to do?

* Should  I let go everything and pretty much start developing a new mindset that  distinguishes friendship from relationship, well knowing I will have to  spend a lot of time with her, while also struggling to pass all my  classes?
* Should I do nothing and hope things get better?
* Should I go all-in and ask her out more often?

Never really understood how somebody could just not be happy but I think I’m at that point. 19m, I have had a good life, parents divorced when I was 3, dad and got custody ,he remarried when I was 7. Don’t talk to my biological mother because she just wasn’t a good mother to me or my siblings. Never had a problem with anything until high school. Met a girl in my sophomore year of high school, we dated for the better part of 2 1/2 years. I’ve always been the romantic type and it was no different, I loved her with all I had until I started hanging out with the wrong crowd. They kept saying it would never last because we had never had sex, she wanted to wait until marriage but we were active in other ways. Eventually I got consumed with it and started pushing it with her, I lost touch with my romantic side and all I cared about was how many bases I hit. I never pushed it too far but it got to a point where I ruined the relationship. She broke up with me when we graduated high school. Man, that fucked me up. I called her everyday for a week telling her I would fix my shit and get it together but she had already moved on. I used to be confidant and a happy go lucky guy and now I’m timid and have no confidence. Everything just feels numb and out of touch. I have a good job and a great career ahead of me, a good friend group and family. But it’s almost like it’s not enough. It’s been almost 2 years now since we broke up.

LumiGloomy,2022-01-09 02:38:12+00:00,My friends make me realize I’m a horrible person,"They’re incredible people. I let myself push them away and nearly end our friendship because I felt so much. I was anxious all the time and I have so many insecurities around them it made having friends or having no friends, not matter anymore. I felt the same amount of pain and stress either way and I chose isolation. 

I only realize how bad of a low period I was in when I look back at that time. And it was building up for over a year. I had to figure out if the reason I was there, with them, being friends. Is because I actually wanted to be their friend or if it was because I was too afraid to let go and be alone. And for 3 months I stayed away but I always kept our means of communication open. I always answered them when they did check in. I heard many things lately that made me go back. 

I reached out to one of them a few days ago and asked if it was possible to mend our friendship. They told me “Of course, to me our friendship never let. You just needed some time to yourself.” 

Why did I try to run away from them? How did I come to villainize them and always assume the worst from them when they never acted that way towards me? How can they be so merciful towards me? When they went through something similar I didn’t nearly react the same way. And I decided I should reach out to the second friend tomorrow. Instead they reached out to me first. 

I don’t know how they do it. Was I ever like that myself? At one point I was a bit but I guess I got hurt too many times. And now I’m the one hurting people."

**The first bit is more about my childhood so you can skip it if you want:**

Ever since i was a kid (like 7-8 yrs old), my parents have forced education and extra-curricular activities down my throat because its just how asian parents raise their kids and i will never understand it. Obviously as a kid, i didn't know any better and thought it was normal to have an overwhelming weekly schedule of random clubs, unnecessary tuitions and revision sessions with my dad that would just end up with him losing his temper and hitting me until i got the answer right. i just battled through it bcos its what my parents expected of me so of course its what i had to do.

when i was 11, i got into the academically best high school for girls in the country after doing entrance exams (in the uk, there are grammar schools which are basically selective schools that require you to do exams and then they select the top 150 candidates or so depending on the school). while i thought that was the best thing that happened to me since thats all my parents wanted from me at the time, thats where everything went to shit for me, from my already shitty mental health to me literally having no idea what the point of my life was.

**Okay, read from here:**

High school made me realise that i had no idea who i was and what MY goals were, not what my parents wanted me to do. i don't know why it took me so long to realise that the reason i felt like i had no passions or interests of my own was because my parents never allowed me to enjoy the things i was doing because everything they ever made me do was so that i could get into the best university and so my whole life has been about doing the best at everything, from winning sport competitions to getting the top grade in all the music and drama exams to getting random awards and certificates just so that i had the best ""uni cv"" i could possibly have. my parents along with the toxically competitive environment of my school just made me so stressed all the time about doing well that i lost all motivation to study or pursue anything i thought i had an interest in and instead immediately dismissed it as""stupid"" bcos it wasn't something deemed ""impressive"" or ""realistic"" in the eyes of my parents. They influenced my brain so much that i didn't even feel like i could like something that didn't seem good enough to them.

i never got to really experience the enjoyment of my extracurriculars, or even my teenhood for that matter bcos of all the stress i was under. i barely every hung out with my friends and when i didn't have to go to clubs or tuitions i would just be locked up in my room doing revision and homework, although towards the end i was just completely burnt out and could barely have the energy to do anything. Never had time to deal with any of the mental shit i was going through or maybe i just didn't want to cos it was too complicated i don't even know...

So here i am now, doing physics at a university my parents aren't too happy about (even though its top 15 in the uk), and thinking about what i would've chosen to do if my life didn't turn out the way it did, if i lived a different, more free life with parents who are open and accepting of however their kid wants to live their life.

recently, i keep thinking about how i would've chosen to explore the arts more. even though i went to singing lessons, piano lessons, speech and drama etc, i never enjoyed it because i was forced into doing them from the start and it was more so about doing it for the sake of my future rather than just as a hobby or an enjoyable free-time activity as im sure its meant to be for most people who choose to do them. ive always been a music addict, i listen to music all the time and its kinda what got me through life so far as dramatic as it sounds. i think i like singing and ive been told a couple times in the past that im good at it but ive always had a very low self-esteem and have trouble convincing myself im good at something even when other people point it out for me, i can't seem to see it for myself. thing is im rly rly shy and have bad anxiety so i can't sing in front of other people and i only do it when i know for sure im alone, its kinda the only time i can practise. i also have tried using software to produce music and make mashups of songs which i rly enjoy doing, i also rly like tv shows and the process of making one - producing and writing is something i find so interesting and even acting is something i think i would enjoy but i dont know i feel like ive missed out on figuring out what im actually good at and being able to actually choose to do something that would make me happy - i dont even know what will truly make me happy which is why i just want to start over in a different life.

im sorry if it seems like im being way too dramatic, i honestly feel like its stupid for me to feel like this but its something ive just wanted to get out of my system for a while now so yeah... :/

also sorry if stuff doesn't make sense, i kinda got carried away and forgot spelling and grammar exists"
Conscious_Drawing_52,2022-01-09 00:14:20+00:00,Just a sad person rant,"I (f22) grew up in a traditional strict household where my parents didn't really want me to have friends and just focus on school. Since i felt alone when i was younger, because of my parents and lack of friends, I would turn to online dating and then eventually become a serial dater because I liked the attention or feeling that someone else could care about me. In relationships, the hope is that they can care for me but i end up dating people i end up taking care of. The problem with me is I want something low effort where we can live our own lives but build each other up the same time, as i do like doing my own thing. I do have more friends now but I never want to burden other people so I end up bottling how i feel in, and closing myself off. Nowadays i feel like i wasted my younger years dating people who were infatuated, rather than the kind of person who cared about me as a person, not only the things i offered. I feel like I dont have anyone to turn to. Before I enjoyed being left alone to do on my own thing but now i feel like nothing brings me joy. The things i used to like are boring and repetitive. The more i am alone i realize how lonely I actually am.  

I feel like I am unmotivated to do things I used to enjoy doing. I used to be good at school and now I am failing classes. I feel like I am not going anywhere in my life and that everything I do just isnt good enough and i cant talk to anyone about this. I love my parents and I know they want the best for me but they put a lot of pressure on me. I am bottling up all these negative emotions because i cant share."

They all make me feel like an outsider but my dad hasn't told me to leave. The only benefit of staying with them is saving money but I just stay in my room most of the time and sometimes I feel depressed n lonely. I have a job but looking for a new jobs soon. I'm not close to anyone so but anxious about moving out to live by myself. Would you stay and just put up with the crappy family situation move out? My dad doesn't make any effort to bring everyone closer either :/"
oddonyxxx,2022-01-08 13:49:36+00:00,my lowest low,"Not sure how much longer I can go. I am at the worst low of my life and I have had quite a few. Most of my life I am depressed, not having many friends or going out. I never even planned my future which I am only now realizing isnt common. In high school things were finally getting better. I finally felt happy and even had a relationship. Of course it had to be all ruined. No actually I ruined. I am stuck and so lost. In the past I at least tried to reach out to people online so at least I had some support. Now Im actually reaching out after years cause I am at my breaking point. I keep telling myself to hold on just a bit longer and I'll get my shit together. But Im starting to completely lose hope. I have been feeling this miserable for at least 2 years now. I lost my boyfriend (break up) and I feel like everyone is so distant from me now. Im writing this cause I finally need to get it off my chest. Self harming isnt really helping like it used to yet I am still too big of a coward to actually commit suicide. Going through a break up doesnt help like at all. Especially since I was the one who fucked up and didnt get a second chance. I know that he would probably break up with me again even after the second chance but I am doing so badly that I really just needed him to be there for me. Im not blaming him though, I know I fucked up and now I have to live with the fact that I ruined something so important to me, lost the only thing that made me want to think about the future. I really feel like Im just complaining. But its just hard for me. I dont know how simple existing can be so freaking difficult. It looks like theyre opening schools which is gonna make my mental health drop even lower. I really dont know how I will be able to keep going. I really wanna give up. Its an infinite fight that I'm losing. I hope yall are doing better than me."

I had already been laying in bed scrolling my phone for a while, unable to get up, feeling miserable about life and me and everything. 

Then i heard a chirp in front of my window, a bird must have found the birdseed i laid out there! 
I was so glad that there was a bird eating the grains and dried fruit i left for them that i bolted out of bed to sneak to my window and have a look. 

Before i was able to identify the bird i realised that i left bed and started crying happy tears, because i realised again that there are reasons why i am alive apart from the promise i gave myself. 

I still feel miserable, but i am still alive and that is the first step."

and even for that i gotta find someone who lives there and likes me enough for us to consider marriage which is literally impossible.
i just wanna go to the US no matter how and just live there and work and just be happy making friends and shit maybe resume study in the future.

Kazmir_here,2022-01-07 20:51:03+00:00,I don't feel like I deserve to live. There is nothing I want to do more than attempt today.,"TW: Self harm, suicide and insults

Tittle says all of the substance you'll need. I am a lazy, incompetent asshole with ego twice the size of a shoe he wears. I am horrible to people I know, knew and live with. I am incapable of learning any basic skills or continuing on with them. I lack any motivation to do anything. 

I spend more time thinking about what I'd want than what I should do. I am lazy, and when I finally decide to do the work I am supposed to do I butcher it. I can't be trusted with doing as mundane things as keeping myself alive, room clean and work done. 

I got into multiple relationships that at my age, or any age, would be seen as damaging and hurtful for both parties. I am pretty much addicted to porn and obscure fetishes and fixations. I ruined my sexuality, not to assume I'd ever have a chance. 

I am fat, balding at age of 17 and with sickly skin and multiple self harm scars. I am poor at any communication or people skill. I never talked to any attractive person without being actively forced to. I get attatched too easily. I never once asked anyone out or even started talking to another being by myself. I look like stereotypical 4chan user because I have a neckbeard that grows back faster than other facial hair. 

The only thing I put to any relationship is my humor and it's bad. I struggle to be empathetic or caring, yet feel incredibly hurt each time I mildly inconvinience anybody. I am morally inept and retarded in every sense of the world. I can't deal with my emotions so I cut myself at least once a month multiple times a session, hiding away from my issues. I am a spineless coward. 

I am greedy. I am greedy as all hell. I have oroblems with anger, overeat and despite all that act like a fucking smartass. I am a waste of skin, filled with useless trivia knowledge and no actual skills. As said, I am greedy. Very. So I have a plan. I'll milk every dime my parents put in me. Every rotten one. And once the well runs dry, I'll kill myself. I don't know how. I know I will. I can't live in this world. And the only thing i could care about is comfort. So I'll leave a hedonistic, miserable life until I can't and then will go to live on a farm with all the pet fish who died because I was too shitty to keep them alive."
fallenarist0crat,2022-01-07 17:25:49+00:00,i thought my friends would notice my strange behavior but they just keep making me feel worst.,"it all started because i tried to make plans for my birthday coming up towards the end of the month. i tried being considerate by bringing it up early so they could make time/get time off from work or whatever, but neither of them wanted to do that. instead they kept going over each other’s schedules to choose a day to celebrate my birthday. and when i mentioned how it sucked that we couldn’t celebrate on my birthday or at least around my birthday they got mad at me and called me ungrateful. 

then i said, never mind, forget i even asked because at this point it feels like a hassle. and they got madder at me because they were trying *so* hard to find a day to celebrate. meanwhile i’m over here freaking the hell out because these are the only friends i have and i can feel them slipping away. i’m not in a relationship, i’m not close with my family… stupidly, my only support system is them. and i’m *so* scared of losing them. i’m scared of having to find more friends because i know i’m not good at it. i’m scared of being alone. i already feel alone. and idk… i just thought they’d notice why i’m acting all distraught over my stupid fucking birthday. 

and now i guess it’s open season because they keep bringing up other things about me they don’t like… apparently i’m a know it all. well, i didn’t know that."

dushyant1087,2022-01-07 13:09:08+00:00,Here because there's Noone and nowhere else.,"This been a crazy ride since 2020. I lost my job and my relationship in the same month. It sucks to even think about how good life was before that with my career in an upward trajectory and everything was pretty decent. Losing the job made me lose all the confidence I had. I won't say that things were okay before 2020 but my mental health has never been as bad as it has been since. I'm 27 and I've reached out to people to tell them that I don't feel okay but everyone has their own fucking story to tell and it just makes me realise that nobody is obliged to help me out. I don't even know what is it that I seek when I reach out to these said people. Mental health is still taboo here and to an extent my family members behave differently when I'm around because they know I might not be okay but nobody talks about it. I have no clue what I want to do in life, sure I have a college degree but  work has only been just a distraction I've used to ignore my mental health. I've reached far ends on both extremes, I did a mock of hanging myself in my room and also tried keeping myself busy to not let my mind go crazy with these thoughts. I guess the only thing that had been stopping me from going ahead and hanging myself is all the pain and embarrassment my family will have to go through. I know it's a cowards way out but I don't think the idea of death scares me anymore. It used to but it doesn't anymore. There's a rational and an irrational side in my head and the irrational one is scary when it takes over. It's my birthday at the end of this month and I am pretty sure that I don't want to be here by then. I am not sure about the how or the when but I dont want to live like a constant disappointment to everyone around me. Funny thing is that my parents just told me to 'go die and free them of all the misery' and I know that they didn't mean it and said it in anger (?) but I couldn't help and just laugh a little inside as they kinda just gave me an approval without even knowing. 

I am writing this here because I feel that I just had to tell this to someone before I went ahead with it. Nobody else from my real life would know why I went this far."
suvie244,2022-01-07 12:46:22+00:00,I lost my grandpa.,"He, my Grandpa, was the person I trusted the most. We never fought in any way possible. Instead, he was good to me, better even than my parents themselves. Whenever there was a problem I turned to him to give me his opinion and advice. I grew up around him in the village and now when I think about all the times I spent with him, I have taken them for granted for which I now regret very much. I would give anything to be able to go back in time and tell him how much I love him and how grateful I am for everything he has ever done for me. But it's too late now. I can't accept the fact that I will never hear, see and touch him ever again. Every time I go to visit my grandmother, I expect to see my grandfather sitting in the living room, waiting for me to walk in and shake his hand. We'd talk about everything anything. We'd talk about school, jobs, he'd tell me about stuff that happened in his past, we'd watch TV and eat together until it's time for me to go back home. I miss him so much and I cry every day about it. I can't accept it. I'm on the verge of killing myself just so I can stop thinking about all this, but I can't do it, because I know my Grandpa wouldn't want me to be dead."

I mean everything is meaningless because I'm always alone. What's the point of doing anything when there's no one to share it with? It sucks, I have so many regrets and have burned every bridge I've had. Although I'm not sure if any of it was my fault or not. Maybe I just hung out with the wrong people but maybe I was dumb af. I don't know, it seems like I'm never good enough to function the way normal people do. Or maybe I am a normal person but we are all actually miserable and good things never happen unless you are rich enough to buy them. My situation is very weird with uncertain social connections. I don't know who people really are although I don't mean to insinuate anything insulting I'm just not sure if they're just being polite or not. A lot of the times though they are definitely being impolite on purpose. I don't understand what compels a person to act like that. Hopefully I won't because it seems like they believe something that isn't true, whether it's pessimistic or not depends on the person. Either way it would be great if they acted like an adult and were not annoying but dumb people are easily amused."

I'm 22f and I have done nothing with my life. I'm in a horrible cycle where I get into a depression that's very debilitating so I can't hold a job. I have never had a room to myself. I have lived in a 2 bedroom small apartment my entire life that now currently has 7 ppl and 1 baby in. Even if i did get a job, i would not be able to afford to move out and if i want to live in a decent place with roommates its about the same as a 1 bedroom apartment. I sleep in a bunk bed with my brother and now i don't even have my own bed anymore bc my deadbeat father just came back from out of country so there is no space so my mom sleeps with me like I'm a child. I hate it here. I hate not having my own space. I have no friends. My boyfriends doesn't understand my feelings so i feel like i have no one to talk to. 

I truly wish from the bottom of my heart that i wasn't born. Why would my mother bring me into this life if she knew she wouldn't be able to take care of me. I can't kill myself bc I would feel immense guilt so I'm just stuck here. I don't understand why after all these years of my father being a horrible person that my mom would just let him live with us. He doesn't do anything but take up space. All they do is call me mean but never see how they treat me. I can't get away from them bc I can't afford anything. I just hate it. I feel trapped here. I feel trapped in my mind.

Maybe I'm just in love with torturing myself but when I was suicidal I felt like I understood myself like I was less lonely when thoughts of worthlessness flooded my my head. It's hard being suicidal I understood the pain very well but then my brain was the most productive during the period. These days I just contemplate severe depression and I miss it .

Last year felt like such a period of growth, however with it came a lot of stupid points that just spoiled every moment. It was my second semester in uni, but I was so burnt out that I had no energy to work. I tried everyday to work harder and harder but it just hurt. I got diagnosed with ASD, which made me reconsider a lot of moments in my life. I made friends, that turned out to be assholes. I got my first internship, but I also had to do my part time job with completely destroyed my sleep schedule. I started talking to a really nice girl and I started to like her, but she didn’t like me back. I got to go to uni in person, but the amount of talking and the amount of people just created this overwhelming sense of pressure. There were two other things that messed me up, but I don’t feel like sharing that. All these things happened at once, the good and the bad. I realize that it’s just about perspective. I realize it’s just about time. And I really needed to get this off my chest."

SpacedinLiverpool92,2022-01-07 01:19:29+00:00,I have to be the most unlucky person in the world. What is the fucking point?,"Does anyone just think sometimes that maybe us depressed people are actually the sane ones and that maybe none of this is real? That you have to kill yourself to be accepted into the real world? Like we are in a simulation and people are watching us on big screen and the clever ones are the ones the end their life the soonest, so they can enjoy a real life and actually become the pillars of the society in the true world? The one that die from a natural death are literally dumb as fuck because they believed in the simulation for so long and thats why suicidal statistics are increasing because there are more of us that are realising that this is all a lie? Like it makes so much sense to me, there is so much in the world we cant explain.

I am always in the wrong, no one ever see my point of view. I literally always feel like i live in some sort of matrix world where nothing seems real anymore, i ask certain questions and ask for advice on certain thing going on in my life and people just ignore me like they are computerized and just dont know how to respond so they just go and do something else or freeze for second and move onto another question. Doesn't matter who i ask, family, people i know, colleagues. NOTHING! zero reaction.

I literally feel like when i am just about getting somewhere in life and just when i think normality is about to hit everything just vanishes all at once. My job, My friends, my confidence, dating women, losing money due to unexpected bills coming through all at once. Nothing is gradual and it is exhausting.

I literally have no one for advice, i have tried paying for private therapy and NHS therapy and nothing works. Everyone i talk to, i can just tell they do not care, Its either just a job for them or they just think of the money..... like therapy does not work. it just a waste of money and an hour of my time. 

I will definitely end up trying to take my life at some point within the next 5 years. I literally have no interest in living, i dont see the point in living i have nothing to live for, no ambition anymore, i hate my career choice. I hate my hobbies that i used to love because i dont see the point in doing activities anymore. I hate where i live and i move every 2years because i hate where i live so its not the location its clearly just me. I quit my stable job randomly because my brain convinces me that its a waste of time. I literally can spend days in bed..... 

The worst of it all is meeting new people, i feel like i offend everyone. I could sit there in silence and not give anyone eye contact and people would still hate me by the end of the night. I literally never give my opinion anymore because i am so scared of being shouting at or people hate at me for something i have said. The worst thing about it is, everyone else has an opinion and would say thing that i would say but they get such a neutral reaction. It must just be my face. 

I am angry all the time, i cry at everything. I force myself so smile and be happy around people because when i am not people just look at me like 'wish you would cheer up' i literally act all the time around people because i cant be my miserable self because people get angry at me for being the way that i am. Literally think chucking myself under a moving lorry would be the only time anyone would actually acknowledge me and even then i think they would be over it within 48HRS. Either that or do something stupid so spend the rest of my days in prison because at least in there all i have to deal with is surviving. No job, no issue, no dating, no issue, no hobbies, no issue, no family, no issue."
ComfortableFormal883,2022-01-07 00:47:59+00:00,Maybe at the point of no return,"I think everyone is bored of sob stories, so I'll leave it out.

The facts are, I'm starting to slip into doomer, black pill, whatever.

I do possess strong physical, mental and social traits - cheekbones and jawline, high IQ, public speaking awards and House Captain. That is no attempt to brag, in fact, I think it's worse that I still ended up in this way.

From a previously average life, I now spend most of my time in my room, I isolate myself from friends - preferring to sit alone at the lake instead. As a result of this, I have lost many, which is fair. As the title says, it is 5 days till my 18th birthday. Depressing I'll likely spend my literal 18th birthday like this, when a year ago I looked down upon and felt bad for those that did.

On top of this, many close family members have passed away this year, causing a downward spiral - recently my teachers have told me it is unlikely I will be able to study at my chosen university.

I've tried to make efforts this year - NoFap, positive outlook, working out, but I don't know yet. I think of harming myself and others a fair bit.

I really don't want to slip into a shit, lonely life, but I'm already very much on my way.

I honestly just want to be heard on this topic, which I would be too ashamed to discuss anywhere else. I.E - I'd love some upvotes for validation hahaahhahahahahahaha"

Sinner_Girl_93,2022-01-06 22:59:39+00:00,some days man,3 of my employees babies under 3 have covid. at least 10 family members of my employees have passed from one thing or another. I get cussed out all day as a lead working in member services. I try really hard to think positive thoughts and say positive thoughts even if I don't feel positive. I still get beat down though with everything in my plate I would think naturally. So my husband says to me today I'm always so negative after I told him what an especially awful day it was. He's normally a Saint when it comes to my feelings and depression but every so often he knows just what to say to break me. I work so hard to be negative and yet that's all he sees is negativity.

I havent cried in years , i see people do it all the time and it looks nice but i know i doesnt feel good, it makes people want to help you and then i feel guilty because i feel like i can't repay the favor. I always help people, mostly friends because i know that they need me but then i feel like i havent done anything for them even though its the opposite. Why can't i feel truely happy or good about myself.
i've always wanted to go bunji jumping, it looks awsome its a way to feel free and to know what it would be like just befaure death. i'm only telling you guys because i had an outburst recently where i let a friend know how i feel and he was shocked because i live by the words ""positivity and happiness"" he tried to help me but i left because i didn't want to make myself into a burden, the next day i tald him i was fine and that i just had too much too drink. I don't want to die because it would make the people around me sad at least i hope.

First I get covid, then I get pink eye and the icing on the cake is I'm getting behind on all my bills because of this. I always seem to get to that point where everything is looking up just for it to come crashing down. I'm just tired of dealing with this shit all the time, my dad ( who I hate and have nothing to do with ) seems to be the lucky one, always gets everything good in life and I seem to always be fucked royally. And you know I try to be optimistic and put in my best effort towards work and just everything in general but nope it is just a constant fuck you all the time. I lie to my spouse about the bills so they don't worry, and yet I'm just at the point I can't handle this stress anymore of everything. Just for once I'd love to have something good happen to me, instead of being brought down all the time.. its just a constant hell I'm living in. And I know this sounds like just life or whatever people tell you but it's more than that for me, I'm just tired of everything. I have a 10 month old son who I love but feel as if I'm not enough for him, I just don't have much life left to give to anyone.

Spoke to Girlfriend, she wants to help, but she wants me to get up and is at work. She is very supportive, and is pressuring me to get up and get on with things…

I won’t get out of bed, I feel sorry for her really and those who have to deal with me. I’m not even good at being depressed, just good at laying there doing nothing. 

I dunno if I need to vent or what. I just don’t want to get up or move. I just sometimes wish I wasn’t me."

Normally when I would have a shitty day I would go to the bar and get at least a decent buzz and sometimes even just when having a good day. I have been drinking pretty consistently since I was about 16 I'm now 25 and finally realizing that it was not a healthy way for me to deal with my problems and I feel some kind of proud of myself even if no one else can see it. It has taken a lot for me not to just turn right back to the bottle whenever i have a shitty day at work or a shitty mental health day or when I'm just bored and I don't know if this post necessarily belongs here but I just felt like I needed to be heard by someone maybe someone can relate to me a little bit or something. Sorry this was sort of just a word vomit but man I really just needed to talk about it I guess. And as for right now I just feel completely exhausted and like I can't do good enough even though I'm trying so hard. Could really just use someone to talk to and vent I guess.

Growing up in a toxic environment, since I was a toddler. My brother being diagnosed with a life long mental illness, which is something that I am
expected to accommodate. Having no chances at a relationship as of now. I feel like she’ll be scared away with all the baggage she sees I’ll be carrying. An uncle who financially abuses my Father. Manipulated trusts, so now my Father can’t even sell if he wanted to help better our living situation.

I’m so tired of trying, fighting, and just getting through the day to the point where I’m just burnt out and have no motivation left in me. I’ve tried getting better over the past 4 years but I’m just circling back over and over to the dark place I fell so long ago. It’s like no matter what I do life just won’t let me be happy. I try so hard to be good enough and for others to appreciate me but at that this point it feels like there’s no reason left to keep fighting, yet I can’t bring myself to end it.

And because where I’m at with the cold and snow just coming around, I can no longer ride. I feel like I’m turning cold hearted on the inside. Like I’m dead. When I’m around my friends I don’t feel depressed. Maybe it’s because I’m distracted from my feelings. I feel like posting on my Snapchat kind of like a cry for help.

puppyarms,2022-01-06 03:14:26+00:00,Confused.,"My life…? I wholeheartedly comprehend and live by the “recharge” concept. Wether it be family or even friends, it’s almost draining overstaying somewhere that’s not my house. In my terms? I like to have my… routine? Per say. Anything straying 4 days plus of altering that routine almost gives me anxiety. I am perfectly happy in this way of life… at least I think I am? 

Growing up I did many things alone and learned things in a self-taught fashion, I didn’t want help from others, I’d rather fail and learn from mistakes than I guess learning it from someone else. Looking over me as a person and my future, I can’t help but to see this as damaging in the long run. Am I wasting away my life? Am I addicted to this routine, this loneliness? 

Relationships on the other hand those can be hard, it’s almost like being in the public eye for a few months before said person “understands” your way of life. Being said, if that person even works out for me, and I for them. Easier to not indulge and do what makes me happier. I guess what I’m asking here is if I’m depressed or just do things different than other people? 

Things have been this way for about 6 years

I get distracted so easily, I have a hard time waking up for school, I’m constantly tired no matter how much I sleep, and depression just makes it all worse. I moved in my senior year to another country, and I didn’t even realize how fast paced it was compared to my old school. I’m falling behind on everything. 

I can’t even bother to talk anymore, it’s been difficult making friends at my lowest. I don’t even want to go outside. I’ve had depression for years but this year has been my worst.

I'm starting to build a life and a future with an amazing partner, but the feelings of not wanting to live anymore are constantly on my mind. I simultaneously want to live with her and want to die. It's a massive contradiction and weighs me down to the point where once my obligations, work, eating and drinking, etc. I don't have the will or energy to do anything else. I don't want to live but I continue to almost in spite or myself. It feels like the candle of light is almost out, but I know there must be more. This can't be the end, even though part of me wants it to be. Don't really know what else to say."
stockishot,2022-01-05 09:13:16+00:00,Such relatable lyrics,"It must be nice to have some friends in person
Goin' over to someone's house would be worth it
Do what's best for my life, and I'll do best for yours
But not everyone agrees with my certains
It must be nice to have parents that love you
When you come home from school, they always hug you
Yes, there's sticks and there's stones and they're breaking my bones
But every now and then, I need a hug too
It must be nice to have such a good friend group
Drama happens, but you have them to notice you
You can laugh, you can cry, you can ask, you can pry
But unfortunately, I don't get those to do
It must be nice to link with your online friends
I know with them, that the fun could never end
Yes there's hate, yes there's arguments
But you'll get over it
Well, not always, it depends
It must be nice to have something to live for
If I had that, then I'd probably live more
I don't care if it's small, if it's right, if it's wrong
I just want something to live and strive for
It must be nice to have someone who loves you

I always thought my parents enjoyed this time with me, because I enjoy it with them, but it seems they don't want me around as much. which is okay, but now i just feel more alone. if I lose my comforting relationship with my parents, i will be truly alone. they have been the only stable and consistent people in my life since 2019 when everything started going wrong. anyways. just needed to get this off my chest."

And all I can think of is dead, even if its by the end of this year cause there isn't anything I want so why do I need to be here?"
ContributionFun6491,2022-01-05 03:34:54+00:00,Depressed for doing the right thing?,"Long story short I reported my work for not following proper patient safety practices. I wasn't nessisarily trying to get my higher ups in trouble but I got to the point recently where I said enough is enough if they are putting patients at risk who depend on us to make sure they don't contract infections, it is my duty to report the hospital. ""If you see something say something.""

Well my higher ups managed to cover up the paper trail and forge documents to cover their tracks. I took the liberty of taking pictures of the documents before they tampered with the evidence but I almost feel discouraged from pursuing it 

On the one hand like I said I don't want a patient getting hurt. On the other hand it puts a huge target on my back now for trying to do the right thing. I reported them to a health organization I thought would take my claims more seriously and at the very least conduct somewhat more of an investigation into this matter. But nope. All they did was contact corporate, who is corrupt, and let them get away with it.

I understand that this is a lot of this sub but it really is relative to how I feel. What is supposed to incentivize workers to do a good job? Why am I being punished for taking on Goliath, when it is literally my job to control infections at a hospital during a global pandemic where multiple variants are spreading like crazy in my area? 

It makes me super depressed and it goes to show that sometimes it isn't actually anything you do or don't do. This world really is designed just to bring you down and make you feel like absolute shit. I'm really hating this existence the older I get."

jakegotjokes,2022-01-05 00:05:10+00:00,"16, high school junior","
Hey guys, I’m 16 and junior in high school. Just moved to NC from Jersey, and moving in the middle of high school obviously isn’t ideal. I know absolutely no one and have been at this school since August. I’m not an introverted person, nor do I have social anxiety. I always try to talk to people and spark up conversations with anyone close by. In my old friend group, I was always the one who organized the plans and also usually asked if anyone wanted to hop on cod. But now I’m just burnt out. I drift from class to class with my AirPods in. I probably don’t speak to more than 5 people in a given day, 4 of which being my teachers. Lunch is the most stressful though. The way our seats work is there are a bunch of tables with like 5 built in seats, so you can’t pull any chairs over. Everyday I walk in and all the chairs are instantly full, and one time I tried sitting down at one, but they asked me to leave because I was taking someone’s spot. Now I usually fake a headache so I can sit in the nurses office, do random things on my computer in the library to kill the time, or sit outside on the patio with my head down. I never used to kind school, actually enjoyed it. I had a lot of friends so I would talk to kids in the hall, and in all of my classes I had a lot of friends to talk too. Now, my days are repetitive and boring, with the same thing to expect each and every day. I still talk to my friends though, If I didn’t I wouldn’t know how to manage. It is really sad though when all of them call me on a Friday night at the mall, or movies, and I’m just here. Lying on my bed and listening to mac miller. Every night, it’s the same deal. Some times I cry, sometimes i sleep, and other times I watch Netflix. I’m lost. I joined my local soccer team to attempt to meet people, but still haven’t. I played soccer for about 14 years and looking to play in college. I never labeled myself as depressed because everytime I hear that word I associate it with middle schoolers who want attention. I know it’s not true, but it’s how I look at it. But I do think I am at this point. In addition to all of this, we moved down with my grandma. She was everything to me and had the brightest personality. She was my rock. She always laughed at my jokes, no matter how inappropriate they were. On September 10th, she was walking early in the morning and got hit by a car. She died. This made everything worse. I know it’s a horrible thought, but I put some of the blame on my parents for moving us here. It sucks. I hate it. My aunt told me her biggest worry was me, and how she didn’t know how I would acclimate here. She said that’s all she ever wanted for me, was to be happy, but I don’t know how. I know I’m getting off track, sorry. I don’t know why I’m here. I never usually post on Reddit. Just felt like telling someone. If you’re still here, thank you. Cheers."
CutawayChaser,2022-01-04 22:48:26+00:00,My birthday has been hijacked,"So, my two siblings (bro +7, sis +4) and I have been close for most of our adult lives. It is a family tradition that each year, for our birthday, the sibling of honor chooses a restaurant and the others buy them dinner. About ten to twelve years ago, I decided to ask my bro in law to cook one of his famous smoked turkeys, rather than go to a restaurant. He said he doesn’t mind, he likes it better than Thanksgiving because he doesn’t have to divide his time between entertaining our extended family and cooking, he can dedicate his time entirely to the bird. It was a win all around and became an annual tradition. 

Around six years ago or so, we found out that it was also very close to the birthday of one of her friends (two days apart). She is a wonderful, kind woman, her family is salt of the Earth and genuinely some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. She and I refer to each other as “birthday buddies.” 

So over the next three years or so, it just became a “shared event.” My sister now refers to it as a “framily celebration” and their family is invited every year. I have no issue with any of this, I don’t mind sharing, most of the time. I’ve lately felt like it’s too big a production, and maybe I just want to go back to a quiet meal at Red Lobster, but I enjoy the festivities for the most part, and everyone else seems to have fun.

Right around the time of the 2016 presidential election, it became more apparent that my siblings and I have differing political opinions. I lean more liberal, my sister leans more conservative, and my brother is a diehard Trump sycophant. None of that has even stopped us from being close. But, as Conservatives, my brother and sister have revealed some traits that I find off-putting, especially now where it concerns COVID-19. We all share a mother who is on the tail end of cancer treatments, and as a result is potentially immuno-compromised. I take her to her doctor appointments, I’ve been there with her every step of the way, whereas my siblings have little patience left for her due to some poor choices she has made in life. I also just started a new job that I love, but as I am still new, I want to be available whenever possible not only to create a good impression, but to learn the new job as well as I can.

Which brings us to our current situation. This year’s “framily celebration” (which started as MY birthday dinner, remember) was supposed to happen this upcoming Saturday. I was scheduled to work until 2, and be “on call” until 5. I told my boss it would be great if I wasn’t needed, as there was a party in my honor that day, but would still be available if absolutely needed. It would take me an hour to get to my sisters house from work, so I’d be there right around 6 at the latest, even if I had to stay late at work. I told my sister I might be a little late, but was excited about the dinner. She said it was okay, we’d be eating at around 6, so I wouldn’t miss much.

Well, now I find out my birthday buddy and her family have COVID. She and I are actually on the same page regarding COVID, we wear masks in public and are fully immunized, whereas my siblings mockingly refer to the masks as face diapers and routinely make ridiculous statements about liberal conspiracies.

While I was a bit concerned about the framily being sick, they assured my sister it was the tail end of it, and that they aren’t that sick any more. My sister told them it was fine, no one was concerned about them having COVID (which is NOT true, which she would know if she had asked), and said they were still welcome. I said NOTHING, because I don’t want to rock the boat, though I did explain to my mom what was going on so she could make her own decision about being there for her own health. My mom said she was still going to come and make my favorite cake. My sister just texted today announcing that the “framily celebration” was being postponed a week because “everyone was still recovering from various colds.” When I told her that I had to work later that night, and wouldn’t be able to be there until 7 at the earliest, she said I’d be “just missing appetizers.”

So what that is telling me is that she is willing to postpone the party (which, AGAIN, started out as MY birthday dinner) because her friends can’t make it, but isn’t really phased by the fact that it is less convenient for me that night, and that I may miss part of my own birthday dinner because of my new job. I feel like she is telling me I am not as important to her as her friend.

I almost don’t feel like going now. How do I say “I want MY birthday dinner to be convenient for ME” without sounding like a selfish prick?"

Everything is at a standstill, like I’m living in a reality that wasn’t meant for me. I’ve never in my life felt settled, always just believed that I was dealt a bad hand in life but I’ve made the most of it but really, I often wish I was dead."
Aasgard_Saatana,2022-01-04 20:52:14+00:00,I hate myself so much,"I'm only 19 yrs old and I wake up every single day extremely tired.

I have imagined my suicide more times than I would like to admit, and the only person I really trust is my best friend, but I don't want to be a weight for her (she says that I'm not, but I know that I am).

I don't know what to do anymore... I don't feel like myself, I feel as if I have memory problems (which could be as a result of my medication... But I don't know for certain) and, to be honest, I don't really know why I'm still here... I'm probably waiting for the day I finally snap and do something stupid.

Rant's over. I'm sorry if this bothered you..."
thingswontbeokay,2022-01-04 20:22:40+00:00,"I've been doing better but not good enough, and I'm still suicidal.","I'm doing therapy and taking my meds and I've come a long way (I'd like to think), but I don't think it's good enough.

I actually finished a semester with all A's, but I only took 2 classes. So honestly, it's the least I could do so nothing to be proud about, but I can't say I would've done this a year ago. I also don't feel sad EVERY day. Just will have an occasional off day or break-down, but I've been trying to implement strategies I learned in therapy to subdue all this with semi success. Again, this was impossible not too long ago. I started being more social and taking initiative in steps towards my career, but not by much.

My mistakes are all still there and can't be forgiven. I've wasted my parents money on failing school and just overall providing for me, all at the same time lying about how I'm doing. I'm in a major thats pretty worthless all because I was too stupid to do computer science (couldn't even get a minor because of my gpa and it was my fucking major). I seriously don't feel any pride in my degree and it won't feel like an accomplishment if I get it. Because after all that time and ""effort"", I'm left with something people will just think ""oh he got a bullshit major"" plus it won't get me anywhere I think.

I'm still failing in my passion projects of music, never once finishing a song. I'm still fat, still lazy, still dumb, still unattractive. I'm still irritable, annoying, uninteresting, unkind, and cringey. There's really not much of me that has changed or gotten better.

After all the progress and feeling better overall, I still end up hating who I am and not wanting to be here. Life seems wonderful and exciting at times, but really I don't feel I have many reasons to stay (and I feel this way when I'm not depressed too). I kinda just don't want to go through life and I'm now in a place where I truly am fine with missing out on all of it.

Being better isn't good enough. I need to be perfect to  MAYBE make up for my fuck ups. I know perfect is unreasonable but so was how I handled college so it's not a fair argument. I have to overhaul who I am as a person and completely change too, because who I am isn't good and I don't like me at all. After all this, maybe I'll be comfortable saying I'm doing well. 

Really, at the end of the day, life just seems boring and depressing, so I'm really missing the point in staying.

TLDR: I've been doing better in handling my depression and I'm overall on average feeling better. However, this doesn't change all the fuck ups I've done and I still really just hate the person I am. Now, I'm okay with the idea of not going through life because it really just seems whatever to me, and I feel this way even when I'm not depressed."
Nerodasadist,2022-01-04 20:02:57+00:00,Killing myself would only be a net positive,"I know this will probably get little to no responses, and no one will read it cos it’s long but I don’t care. I’m going to put this out here, and if necessary keep reposting until I get some response. 

I made this account 4 years ago and made similar posts to these, and looking back it’s sickening how little has changed. I’m turning 24 (M) tomorrow and considering how lame my life has been, killing myself could only be a net positive. The main things that are still ruining my sanity are the lack of relationship/still being a virgin, having no friends, and having an empty future

The part that eats at me the most is still being a virgin/not being in a relationship. I know I’m going to get responses saying it’s not that big of a deal but thinking about it really does make me want to take a razor and slice my throat open. I have stayed away from incel shit (it’s terrifying and I don’t want to fall down that rabbit hole of more misery). 

I was bullied for it in high school and early college by former classmates and friend groups. Now I’ll probably get some responses saying “ppl bully you because your insecurity about it is visible” when the only reason they found out is because people asked and I told them, which they then used to mock me. And it’s because of this I now just lie and tell them I’ve been in a few flings so I don’t get harassed or called things like loser or gay. People have also said I’ll have a hard time dating because I’m brown.

I recognize my failure is mostly my fault and also from how I was raised. My parents were very strict in high school and kept me from going out, and as result I didn’t know what to do I college, and was scared of making a fool of myself.  The few times I did start getting close to girls, they either lost interest or my fear of being judged for being a virgin got in the way and I choked up. I want to make a tinder but I have no good pictures (or pics with friends). All my friends and most people I know have gotten laid and been in relationships and I’m being left behind.

I have generally lost contact with almost all of my friends. Most of them have gotten better jobs than me in other other states, with apartments their parents pay for, meanwhile I’m stuck in the same city I’ve lived in my whole life, while living with my parents who I don’t get along with. I see peoples posts on Instagram on their travels and all, meanwhile I can’t afford that cos I have to save up. 

The closest friend I had texts me at his own leisure but never acknowledged or responded to anything I said, and when I called him out on it, he said he does that  because he was busy and hasn’t messaged me since. Another friend messaged me asking me if I wanted to hang out during the holidays then later said he had to go back to work and won’t be in town until the next year. I have another friend in town but he never reaches out to me, and is kind of an asshole, so I never bother with him. 

The only friend I have now is one of my coworkers who’s around my age. We occasionally share memes with each other and she invited me to party and said her friend group thought I was cool. Other older coworkers also invited me to a party and I had fun and got along well with them, but I have no one my age who I consistently hang out with.

Finally my job. I hate it. It’s easy but its dead end and I don’t make enough to live on my own. I just go to work then go home and play video games or watch a movie, then repeat the cycle. The career I want is in the film industry, but considering how much abuses, blacklisting, and corporate control are happening there, I think I’ll never make it (not to mention how hard it is to get a job in that). Especially how even established directors like Scorsese are having to have their films made through Netflix and Apple +. I’ve made a few short films and sent them to a few film festivals (didn’t win anything). I still need a stable job in my college major to support myself and I don’t think I’ll get that.

So in general I don’t have any drive and not much going for me. I’m missing out on the good parts of life, and since my life is being wasted away (and will no doubt continue to do so) why shouldn’t I just get it over with?"

The day before your anniversary she leaves you telling you that she no longer trusts you, that you are more and more detached, that you are not the man who would like to have her…
But you love her with all your heart and if not being with you anymore makes her happy, you understand her and let her go…
After a little more than a year you see her again and talk to her, you tell her how much you still feel bad for her, how much you cried, how much you miss her family, how much you still love her, how long you waited for her, how much you hoped she would forgive you (for this you didn't do).
She replies by telling you that she too has been ill, but that after you she already knew another guy to be with and with whom she had already slept for a long time before leaving you. She no longer loved you for what you did to her (don't confide in her) and that you are just a friend to her now…
Four years of pure love for her thrown to fuck. Four years of not betraying her after various opportunities. Four years spent making her happy and being close, always putting her first, even in front of yourself because you didn't care about your being; you wanted her to be happy...
And now you are alone like a dog, you spend your days cutting yourself and cracking your knuckles trying to feel a pain stronger than the sentimental one. You spend hours and hours of your time trying to keep yourself busy so as not to think, because when you are alone with your thoughts you feel bad, you suffer and you don't sleep. You resumed drinking and smoking joints to detach yourself from the outside world; you isolate yourself because people make you suffer and you are afraid of them.
When you have tried to meet someone new you have always been rejected, sometimes with bogus excuses and sometimes with heavy offenses; and these experiences have made you weaker. No one understood how bad You were and no one ever tried to help you, not even when you asked...

I was enrolled in a pretty prestigious university and doing well. Once covid hit and online classes started I completely flew off the rails and stopped doing my coursework. This was in the spring semester of 2020. I have been in a complete depressive haze since then and haven’t been able to get it together enough to go back to school. I hate myself so much. My school was willing to work with me to get back on track but I dropped the ball every time and fell back into staying in bed all day instead of opening up my laptop and doing my coursework. At this point I feel like I don’t have any options. I just want to give up and rot in bed. I tried therapy but I couldn’t even stick to that. I feel like I’m trapped in this reality that I created for myself and I don’t know how to get out. I don’t have enough experience in anything to get a good job and I don’t know what to do.

Literally_-_Hitler,2022-01-04 04:06:27+00:00,A really rough day!,"So for context I have been doing really good. I have taken my meds and reached out to friends for help. But my Dr forgot to fill my meds and after several attempts i have been off of them for 4 days. I also took all of the weight of the holidays on myself to make sure my kids had a great one. So much so that i cried for several days out of being happy. But then everything steam rolled and i was off my meds. I went on a binge where i had to have my ear buds on all the time piping music to me to keep me balance. I lost it though together and when my ex showed up to give me backpacks for my boys she saw me crying and pulled all the levers. Called my dad and the crisis line. I in turn called the cops. There was a whole lot of back and forth but it all came down to me standing my ground and saying NO, i did not want to be put in a psych lock down. I fought the crisis people who ended up leaving with their tails between their legs and then a huge argument with my psych until i proved it was their fault that i didn't have my meds. Currently i am triggered by my upstairs neighbors who's kids i can only imagine do american ninja courses in the living room and am battling with my dubstep and sound bar. Basically nothing changed though. I'm sad, and don't find a reason to go on. But is it so wrong to want to be left alone? My whole life i have survived long points on not being in therapy or on meds, when i knew they were wrong for me. So can't i just say i am sad and don't want to keep going while at the same time trying to get meds and therapy?"

I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't think properly. Only bad memories and there is not one good coming up. Its just about staying up late and ""imagine"" something good to get myself going. I am in a loop, always down, sad and unproductive. Don't have much money, only I can buy food and rest goes to games to distract myself from this reality. But its not enough. Sometimes I would just pause whatever I am doing whether it is work, a hobby or something else just to feel a force bringing me down. And I am just tired of it. Since young age I have always either abused or silenced for saying something stupid. And now I am trying to figure out if they were right about it, if I deserved it. I hate myself for thinking that. There is a thought at the back of my head that I won't live past 30 which is pretty near because I don't see any future for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I am tired of letting people down that put their faith and hope in me. Now I can't talk to people properly because I am afraid. Afraid of making promises that I will not be able to keep. I am tired of people loving me because I know I will let them down at some point and they did nothing but to show love and affection. I am tired of living in a constant loop where I go to work and come home just to sit down at my desk and feel down for nothing in perticular. I am tired of blaming myself for something I did not do and wasn't/isn't in my control. I am tired of saying to myself ""It will get better after this."" and it never does and slowly continues to go down. Family member passed away recently and I don't know how to deal with it. I can feel like my brain is eating itself. I am becoming more forgetful and more dull.

I’m suddenly panicking because I feel so much more comfortable being alone. I invited her over and at that moment I really meant it. Now I wish I hadn’t. I haven’t worked since before Christmas due to our clinic being closed. It was unexpected and I have been in anti-social mode since. My 6yr old son and live with my family (parents 50ish, 25F sister, 30M brother) in a separate guest house from them. Sons dad [30M] typically has son during day time for Zoom school and has son over 2 nights a week. It’s holiday break so they’ve been at home with me during the day. Yesterday I asked them to stay at sons dads house and have not contacted them except to ask them to stay there tonight as well. I think that I’ve needed a break from them. I feel bad because I feel like a shit mom for having those feelings. Sons dad and I have had a rocky romantic to rocky platonic relationship. We try to keep it civil but I tend to snap occasionally. I avoid confrontation and bottle my feelings like I know I shouldn’t. But I can’t help it. I feel like being antisocial and avoiding people in general helps to not deal with conflict. But obviously I’m not growing as a person and setting a terrible example for my son. I hate myself. I wish I didn’t have to deal with this. I’d kind of rather not be alive. I feel bad for my family. I wish they didn’t have to deal with me.

Evey day I go to school, sit in class, and don't learn anything. My parents, who are pretty much the only people I talk to, have this super cheery fake happy thing going on 24/7, always singing humming the same tunes. My life is scripted, they say the same thing in the same sing-song voice every morning, evening, night, it makes me want to ouch myself in the face. This is what life is. School will turn into work, and I'll be dragged through the gravel every day. The things that are supposed to help me cope, looking forward to things and doing things I like just hurt. I don't want there to be a future. I feel like for the last year, I've been at the end. Listen to the song ""magenta - sextile."" It perfectly embodies this feeling of being at the... end.

While I'm thankful to have found some hope, I realize how messed up it is that the difference between suicide and perseverance depends on the attention of another person. It reminds me that I haven't been living for myself for a very long time, and I wonder if I ever will again.

Lonley_Femboy25,2022-01-03 05:55:28+00:00,Alone and needing advice,Well I guess I should start by saying I'm new to Reddit but have seen a lot about it and wanted to give it a shot. My name is Jade I'm 25 from Ohio and have not come out as bi/Fem. I've lived a rough life and it's all starting to pile up on me and I'm at my breaking point. I'm not sure how else to say this but flat out I'm severely depressed and I don't know what to do about it.ive been self treating for years with marijuana but I feel like that's making the situation worse because now I'm addicted to that feeling of fuck it who cares. What little family I have and firends just don't understand how depressed I am. I was homeless for 5 years and just started on get back on my feet. In the last month I've lost my car my job and my girlfriend and it's really starting to mess with my head. I've thought about killing my self because I don't see any other way out of this. Everytime I try to talk to someone I feel like they think I just want attention but that's far from the case I seriously don't know what to do or who to talk to. I feel like everyone hates me and that I'm just a burden on everyone in my life. I've thought about moving to  new city or state but honestly I'm scared to be alone somewhere new and have no resources to fall back on. I've tried taking to suicide hotlines and they don't help I feel like I'm talking to a robot. I guess what I'm try to say in all this is that I don't know what to do with my self anymore. It's been hard without my parents and there's no one to turn to for advice. Please I'm alone and scared I just want to be happy again

legaldrugsonly,2022-01-02 19:55:32+00:00,I’m so lost,"Not making it back this time!

I mean I’ve been depressed before, I’ve been suicidal but this feeling is neither. 
I’ve lost care in absolutely everything I do, everything I’m meant to care about, my family, my friends, a routine , life. 
I’ve just drifted so far away and my excuse is fuck it, I don’t Care.

I’ve used weed for the last 2 years and it’s a fucking joke now. I’m more than addicted it’s costing me nearly 2 grand a month, and I don’t even know why I love it so much. 

I can’t stop thinking about dying ,it makes me happy thinking about it. 
While on the other hand my brother is so far lost, in a world where he can’t get back. I believe it’s psychosis but he’s using mad drugs to find himself. He says the world is evil and there is people who run the show. 
Using drugs like meth and Ghb, but as much as I knew about drugs. I didn’t know what Ghb was to be fairly honest. 

I’ve always been depressed like sometimes suicidal but just a very dull feeling that never goes away. 
I used to always overdose with xtc, Sometimes dying and having to have a ventilator to be brought back, and having to breath through tubes what not.
But I’ve seen what Ghb does and what it’s effects are. 
It’s similar to xtc, such euphoria. 
But very lethal mixed with other downers. I thought asphyxiation was genius. 
The only time I remember being happy was with you Lauren. 
There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think about you, I miss you like fuckin crazy and it’s driving me to death. It’s going to drop me off at deaths doorstep. I’m going on to eternity , where I would love to be with you forever. 
I’ve appreciated this world and what it holds, the joyful medicines that journey us deep into our minds or the wonky shards that makes us unable to walk
I’ve loved it
Appreciated the time given, the life I was given, getting to meet so many amazing people, but I was not making it past 20. 
Was just never meant for me.
I love you all Reddit, as you have such meaningful words, 
May I journey to eternity"
impossibletissue,2022-01-02 19:23:53+00:00,Let’s just talk? I am so alone and don’t have the motivation to change,"No advice please, I just want to talk. My adhd brain is going a million miles an hour and I just want to dump.


I don’t get out much nor do I have many friends. I deleted all social media such as instagram and Facebook over two years ago and didn’t bother to keep in touch with any of my followers because we weren’t really “friends” anyway. Ever since Covid, I haven’t gone out much at all aside from work. No joke, I spend majority of my waking hours in bed.


I have some benzo prescriptions from a few years ago that I take periodically just because I don’t want to be awake - so I literally sleep away my entire weekend and repeat the same routine of waking up for work, coming back home and laying in bed everyday. 


I’ve also realized how much I hate being sober. I hoard all medication I’m prescribed just in case I decide to… you know. I have a medical marijuana card that has helped a ton with my desire to not be sober, but as soon as I take a break.. it’s like the world sucks again. I hate being sober lmao. I am in constant physiological pain and I will take anything that distracts me from the fact that I’m alive.


I work in healthcare so I obvi know the consequences of my habits but I just don’t care. I don’t care about anything, don’t care about anyone, don’t care about myself. I’m just… existing. 


I’ve struggled with depression since my teen years. I’ve become a hermit of my formal self although my formal self isn’t great either. I hate everything about me but my brain tells me I’m a peace of shit and deserve what’s happening to me so I just… let it. Life sucks. I’m so tired. 


Bruh I forgot to mention that my hair is falling out? Just got diagnosed with androgenic alopecia so that’s great. Love that for me. Life is amazing."

happysobercrafter,2022-01-02 14:08:33+00:00,This Helped Me When I Got Badly Depressed," 

First, I want you to know I have been sober for over 14+ years. I became an alcoholic because of my traumatizing upbringing. I ended up clinically depressed, with complex ptsd, amnesia, brain damage, and learning impaired, plus a bunch of physical problems. Currently, I live on disability.

The self-hatred and self-destruction my abusers (my mother and two older sisters) brainwashed me to believe about myself was buried deep. My family cruelly saturated me in their hateful words; I heard them so much; I came to believe them. I had no one to tell me different. Our brains record what it hears often enough. Isn’t repetition how we learn in school?  

I did not realize how much my upbringing tormented and tortured me until I cleared some of the hatred out of my head. I was used to it; I knew no different. I had to undergo hypnotherapy to reach that trash in my subconscious. Certified in it, my therapist did my sessions; I had been going to her for years at this point.

Today, I live grateful because it changed my life; I still have lots of problems, but my thoughts don’t punish me like they did. My mind is quiet, plus it is easier for me to come up with solutions and goals I can work towards. My self-esteem is healthier! I have read that the shape a person’s self-esteem is in determines how successful they will be in their life. I see that clearly now. I see my improvements over the years and how I manage better now. 

It's Heaven!! 

What I did was this, and it was scary to do, but I got through. If you have never done this, don’t do it alone. I needed my therapist's guidance through the first couple of times; after that I felt comfortable accepting other putrid fighting I inherited from my abusers on my own because I knew what to expect. So I caution you; don't start this on your own, please!

It was hard at first to even think about the thoughts I pushed away for decades of my life, but once I accepted them, they became weaker. 

I think you know what I am about to say: I had to accept HOW my family made me feel because the abuse and lies they pummeled me with hurt and damaged my feelings. I had to work to heal them, just as if I had cut myself. My feelings hurt, and I benefited from accepting how my so-called family wounded me. I validated what my feelings already knew. 

I recorded my hypnotherapy sessions so I could work on this at home in between appointments. Most days I listened to the sessions twice a day; sometimes three times. It was really painful, and it took me weeks of slowly making my way through those sad emotions, but I did it. I also watched sad movies that made me cry to continue to grieve over what they upset me over. Can you think of some movies that make you cry too? They might be helpful in this way, for whenever you are ready to tackle this. 

What astounded me was being able to think and talk about those problems without being crippled by them. I might cry a tear or two and my voice might crack, but I can talk about them. I don’t end up crushed like I did. 

Do you see that? The power of those words in my head that once stopped me dead in my tracks was much lower. 

Over time, I realized our brains record the information. Our emotions tell us what is going on around us and inside us, whether that is happy, sad, or any emotion in between. As I resolved more and more of what hurt me, my instincts became stronger as well. That really rocks!!

So, what do you think? 

Pace yourself; do this only if you feel it will help you. Your recovery path differs from mine. What might work for you could be a variation on this process I use. And if you don’t do this now, you might want to later on. 

It’s not for me to tell you. That is your decision to make.And if you want to, message me about your progress! "

Remarkable-Ad-7975,2022-01-02 02:00:59+00:00,What is happiness?,"I'm sure all of you in this subreddit are striving for some form of happiness, but what is that? When you think of happiness, what comes to you're mind? Money? Love? Sex? For me, I dream of being 30, a well respected member of my community around me, who I trust, with my kids running around, making messes, driving me and my future wife insane, but we can't help but laugh because we're in this together. I get to watch them go to school, kiss my wife goodbye, and go to work, and see all my buddies, where we joke and do work all day. Then I come home, tired, hug my wife like its the last time ill see her, and then she goes back to prepare the meal she made for me while I was at work. Whenever I think of this, this is what I want my future to look like, which is kinda fantastic, and unrealistic which really hurts me. The fact that on every platform we have to fight and complain and act cool by dissing people who have problems. Like we all have problems guys, why do you feel the need to say ypur opinion? Like I get it, I wont say I'm perfect either, there's a few times where I've commented without thinking, but in the end, it just makes me feel shitty. So why can't we have these down to earth, possible fantasies that describes what happiness is to us? Because we strive for happiness. We try so hard to be happy that we just can't, either that or we know better then to march through a war with a smile on our faces, barely touched. Sometimes its hard to imagine a world where im actually happy, and have my dreams come true."

I've always felt like there was so much more I could be doing, wonderful things like art or writing or academia but I train myself to do those things and find out their not enjoyable. How do people find those things that they're good at that make them feel happy? I know stupid ignorant people that do NOTHING and live lives of luxury and comfort but I work constantly waste my time for some money and just barely pay my bills. My SO doesn't find me attractive anymore. We're good friends and we do stuff together but she basically lives at my house now, doesn't help pay anything or clean or anything, works from my apartment, but worst of all she doesn't physically love me. I don't mean that to be crude she won't kiss me with any passion, we don't have intimate time unless I initiate which makes me feel awful after a while and she gets mad at me if I try to often once accusing me of ""treating her like a piece of meat"" it's now been a month since I've even hit on her a little... She doesn't even notice. My dad passed away in July, and my younger sister needs to leave she is meant for so much more than these towns offer. You'd think that would make my mom and I closer but she doesn't return any attempts to bond for days and generally after it's too late. Even my dog, who was the perfect dog for two years has taken to disrespecting me. He poops in his cage to spite me and I don't know why that started. Sometimes all I can think about is ending it sitting on a beach by the river just because it would probably be so long before anyone even noticed I was gone and I think about that alot.

atmyfcknglimit,2022-01-01 20:34:01+00:00,At my limit,"Yeah i dont know what to do anymore. Dont mind me, im only writing this because im having a moment. Otherwise id choke on the words first. I dont like to hear myself think, i hate and dont trust myself so much that i dont even want to acknowledge what i may be feeling or thinking. Im just going through the motions really. But anhedonia is legit now (before it was caused by weed). I stopped weed and everything seemed fun again and i was enjoying my days until about a month, maybe more now. Literally nothing is fun. Theres nothing that i want to do, eat, think about. Nothing. Im fu*king dying over here. The days are so painfully slow. If im lucky i might distract myself for a while (not having fun, distracted) and then i inevitably get bored again and boom, existential crisis. I contemplate su*cide everyday. Wont do it, sadly, im a coward. Its torture, really. I dont fit into any label with mental illnesses and no one understands. Seriously. I lack almost complete empathy, always have but now is worse. I dont understand how people get attached to others/fall in love. Ive been in a relationship before, lasted 2 years, but i realized that i never really loved them. I asked myself everyday ""ok but do i really love them?"" You shouldnt ask yourself that if youre happy with your relationship. I know now that it was probably my attention starved self. Someone liked me so i went nuts over them. It was really rocky since i discovered i had trauma with intimacy, and they wouldnt tolerate it. Also im really dependant and a people pleaser. Overall garbage, i know. Seriously im a monster. To give an example, i wish death upon my 10 year old nephew everyday. But in my defence hes a pos. Ppl will lose their mind because hes ""JUST A CHILD"" but they dont know/live with him. For real, a nightmare child. Might have oppositional defiance disorder and lack of empathy also. Compulsive liar and overall cruel. No, im not exaggerating. He screams at his mom (my sister, horrible and terrible parenting), calls her stupid, b*tch, crazy, tells her to shut up, throws/breaks things, refuses to do as told. I live in my sisters house for the time being, and i just cant take it anymore. No, i cant just ""move out"", i work a partime minimum wage job and i have to pay my sister for living here as well as whatever stuff is needed in the house while she goes shopping. Ive paid over $600 to help lower her $1,500 water bill. Oh, but whenever i tell her how her kids are filling up the tub again, or just playing with water/leaving lights on, she loses it. ""THEYRE JUST KIDS DONT LOWER YOURSELF TO THEIR MENTALITY."" Ok. But she can call them horrible things/get pissed off at the smallest thing they do no problem. I think she just hates being questioned. She has it in her head how shes the best mommy in the world. Not really. Think of these moms who dress up their kids and take them to disney or sm but its all for the pictures. She had them way too young and as such never learned how to have patience with them/pay them attention. On her phone all day or locked up in her room with her toxic boyfriend. My mother (who also lives here) has schizophrenia and it just makes everything worse. I dont have peace, never have. My 2 big sisters got removed when i was 4 because mom couldnt take care of us. I was left there, though, because my dad lived in the next street over, who was never present anyway. (We dont have the same dad). What a horrible mistake. I grew up being the ONLY mediator amongst a sea of irresponsible adults. Dad was a drunk with anger issues, mom screams, breaks things, was never present as a mother, and my extended family hated us. They had money and we didnt, so. I remember when i was a kid, around 8, i stayed over at my aunts house (she was the one who agreed to take in my sisters) and she left me in the living room on a comforter with a movie on. I was petrified of the dark. The movie ended an hour ago and i laid frozen in the dark. I managed to brave my way to my aunts room and after debating if i should knock for over 10 minutes, i did, and asked if i could sleep there. ""You have your bed in the living room"" was her answer. So off i went to the living room again, and i laid there scared until 11pm hit and one of my sisters came home from work. (That night it was only me and my aunt in the house). My sister was shocked, asked why i was there alone. Then she changed clothes and laid down with me. I was so damn happy. And then my aunt walked by and promptly told her that she had her own room, so alone i was left again. Anyway, i am now a pathetic adult who cant connect with anybody and a pos. Maybe im depressed because im poor. Although ive always been, so maybe im just tired of it. I dont deserve anything, of this im certain, but i just think its wild and unfair what my childhood was, ynow. Im 22 now and im dead afraid of leaving the house for more than half n hour because mom is completely dependant on me and im the only one who can calm her down. In her head, people are her enemies, so screams and fights are normal here everyday. I used to cry, dont do anymore. Cant. Im just so done. I dont have privacy, peace, anything i can call mine. No friends/things i like. Ill stop now."
Sinner_Girl_93,2022-01-01 19:29:16+00:00,Two people fighting for time on the surface. Charli is coming back,"As I get older, I find it more and more difficult to give a damn and with that, comes losing my grasp on Charli. Charli is the best way I know how to describe how I feel. Two polar opposites fighting for time on the surface. I thought I could conceal the real me or at least what I think is the real me. I tried to blend in and bury her deep inside me. With Charli gone I wasn't cutting; on the outside I looked happy. even. About two years ago something changed though. This other me started to emerge and it felt good. 

I started going out all hours of the night. Hooking up with men while my husband slept or worked. Doing lines and pills daily. I was starting to lose control. I had to reel her back in. She is so much fun though. She doesn't have to control anything. She just goes with the flow. Does exciting and new things. But me. I am controlling. Uptight. Anxious. I had to control her. She was going to ruin my life. 

I want to be that free happy person all the time. I want to have no fear or anxiety and when those feelings do arise, I want to concur them.  I just don't know who I am supposed to be. I just don't want to make the wrong decision."
SHRPSHOT93,2022-01-01 19:04:23+00:00,Just...,"So this is my first ever post on here, and the first time I've ever really talked about my clinical depression. 

A little bit of background; I'm a 28/yo male, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and severe generalized anxiety when I was 23 but have been experiencing both since I was a kid. I've had severe panic attacks since I was 8 or 9, and I've never really gotten a good handle on it.

When I was a kid, my parents would fight constantly. At the time, I just thought that's what everyone's parents were like that. All my friends back then had parents that were either divorced, or would rarely be seen together, so I never thought anything of it. My 1st grade teacher, Mrs. O'Connell, kind of had it out for me. Her husband was dying from cancer and she took it out on her students, namely me and one other boy in the class, Anthony. She would single us out all the time, and even went so far as to suggest that I, and him, be tested for a learning disability (which I was, and nothing was ever found). Due to that, my parents signed me up for sessions with a therapist, who I went to weekly for about 1 1/2 years. 

Every summer, my family would vacation in New Hampshire where my grandfather owned a cottage on a lake. One year when I was 8, my mom had to stay home for work, so it was just my dad, my brother and I on vacation. When we arrived back home after a great week, my mom had the local police at the house, who told my dad that he had 15 minutes to grab some clothes and leave the property. For the next 2 years, he would live in hotels and with my Aunt, before eventually landing in a small apartment in town. That's when the panic attacks started. I had an unrelenting fear that my dad was never coming back, and had recurring dreams where he would come to pick up my brother and I, only to be hunted down and killed by an unseen entity, at which point I would wake up. And again, I was only 8. 

Then, amidst all of that, when I was 9, the attacks of 9/11 happened. We lived in NJ, within view of the NYC skyline (which was visible from our living room window), and we could see the plume of smoke coming from ground zero. I'm not sure I fully grasped what was happening until, watching the news, they showed people jumping from the upper floors of the trade center. That changed me, fundamentally, to the point that I didn't want to exist in a world where something like that was possible. Of course, this made the panic attacks worse. My parents were in the middle of a really nasty divorce by then, and it just felt like the entire world was falling apart around me. I was never a super popular kid, but all of this drove me to isolate myself even further. 

On my 10th birthday, my parents finalized their divorce (which they both deny today), but that wasn't even close to the end of it. There was a nasty, awful custody battle that would last another 5 years, until I was 15 or 16, waged by my dad. By then, I was really acting out. Drinking and smoking as much as I could, skipping school at any opportunity, and constantly getting into trouble. I had always found school really easy, and was of the mindset that it was largely just a waste of my time. My freshman year in highschool, I had missed so many days that I needed to be held back. My dad still insisted I take the finals, I said no, so he punched me in the face (not the first time). I hit him back, went to my mom's, and didn't talk to him for another 3 1/2 years. 

Life kind of normalized by then, I joined the marching band in school and started dating, I got really into metal drumming and started a band with a couple friends. But eventually, my anxiety started to get bad again, and I was kicked out of the band I helped to start. I started skipping school again, and ended up dropping out at 17. I was still dating the same girl I had lost my virginity to at 15, who I'll call A. She was older than me, and went away to college where I'd go visit her for another 3 years. 

Then when I was 19, I got a job working in the stock room of a shoe store at the mall. The assistant manager was a girl my age, who I'll call S, and we ended up getting together, behind my long term girlfriend's back. I did eventually break it off with A, but I now think of that as one of the biggest mistakes of my life. She, S, introduced me to hallucinogenic drugs, and I dove in head first. My brother, who's 3 years younger, saw us having the time of our lives on these drugs, and wanted to try them too. So after talking it over with S, we decided to let him. He had the same amount as we did (what we thought was mescaline, but was actually research chemicals), but he had a really bad reaction. He ended up convulsing, vomiting everywhere, and generally freaking out. We got my mom, and called an ambulance. With paramedics came the police, who promptly arrested me for child endangerment and possession. Sitting in county jail, not knowing whether my brother was alive, I was done. With life, with everything. I was done. S and my mom bailed me out, and told me my brother was okay, that he was in the hospital, and that the police said I was not allowed anywhere near him. That whole situation absolutely broke me. I had almost killed my brother, and I now had a criminal record. After a few months, S couldn't take it anymore, and ended up taking off to Florida very suddenly (she lived with me by then). And I fell into a really severe depression. I decided, in my desperation, to give my dad another shot, and began working for him along with my brother.

Around that same time, my mom had an experience with a botched dental surgery, where the surgeon (who we later found out was a fraud) drilled into the nerve canal in her lower jaw in 4 places, severing the nerve and causing irreversible nerve damage. She sued, and won, but now lives with a condition called CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome), which is treatable, but incurable. There was a lot of friction between us, mostly because of the situation with my brother and S. With the cash from the lawsuit, she, in secret, bought a house out of state and told my brother and I that we needed to move out on our own (after the court case was settled, he had moved in with us). We found a place, and continued working for our dad. 

By then, I was 22, and the depression was at an all time high. I started missing work after about a year of relative consistency, and after a huge fight with my brother, I tried to hang myself. I was hospitalized for 72 hours, where I was diagnosed with clinical depression and severe generalized anxiety. I started taking medication, but it didn't work fast enough for my dad. He's of the mindset that depression isn't a real disease, and that it's just me being weak minded and lazy. After trying to get him to understand for about another year, all while sinking deeper into the depression, I couldn't take it anymore and I decided that if I didn't do something, I was gonna kill myself. My mom offered to help, so I moved in with her in her new house out of state, at the age of 26. 

And this brings me to today. I've been living with my mom for almost three years now, and I'm more depressed than ever. The panic attacks have come back in full force, along with night terrors and generalized mania. Recently I was diagnosed with manic depression, or bipolar disorder, and I just don't know if I can keep going. The world is going crazy, science denial and otherism has gotten so bad that I really doubt whether we'll ever get a handle on Covid, or climate change, or have a functioning democracy for much longer. Global economy is hanging by a thread, and nothing seems to be working the way it should be. It's almost as if humanity couldn't be bothered to save itself. Everyone is so focused on themselves, their own vanity and pride, and nobody seems to notice, let alone care that the world is imploding. 

I know I need help, but I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I can handle living in this kind of world anymore, with a humanity that's become generally indifferent to everyone and everything. I don't think humanity cares enough about itself to save itself, and it's looking more and more likely that we're not even gonna try."
JustEuthanizeMe,2022-01-01 14:27:09+00:00,"I feel burning, overwhelming, furious rage at everyone in my life","Granted, there’s only 3 people in my life at this point and one of them I’m pissed at because she doesn’t talk to me anymore. Point is it’s not massively exceptional to be angry at 3 people at once but I can’t fucking put into words how deep the rage for them is.

Two most prominent right now are my mum and her fucking pathetic husband. I was forced to move back in with her at the start of the year when my depression lost me my job, and I’ve fucking regretted not just accepting homelessness ever since. Those two people people got together, they became a fucking cancer. A fucking black tar pit of all humanity’s most repulsive traits. 

Had a massive fight with my mum about an hour ago cause she apparently had absolutely no choice but to make some totally unnecessary anti-Semitic comment that was based on literally nothing (they both have increasingly white-supremacist ideals that have only increased since they met). She knows full well shit like that makes me uncomfortable and that I won’t ever agree, so I can’t think of any reason to say it other than to start a fight. Then I do lash back, and she turns into the fucking shocked Pikachu meme, and acts like she’s a victim. Then they both go into the kitchen and whisper about me when they think I’m outta earshot cause they’re the most pathetic cowards I can imagine. Fucking Peter Pettigrew looks like Steve Rogers compared to these fucking wastes of oxygen.

And then I’m stuck with a slow-burning, boiling under the surface kinda fucking rage towards my ‘friend’. Don’t think I can even use that term in inverted commas anymore. She was the only ‘friend’ I’ve ever actually had, but I guess I’m also realising that it was never really a friendship and that fucking pisses me off too. 

I get that I’m not easy to be friends with. No one ever really tried until she did, for good reason. But I told her over and fucking over the reality of who I was and what I’m actually like. And she was adamant that she “wouldn’t ever leave”. But if course, after the self-harm, the drinking, the suicide attempt and me getting feelings for her, I pushed her to her limit. That makes sense to me, those were the choices I made and I can live with that, her leaving was the expected outcome.

What I didn’t expect is for her to string me along for some fucking reason I can’t figure out. After I told her I had feelings for her, something every obviously changed. We only saw each other in person one time after that, when we’d text, I’d barely squeeze 5 replies outta her before she’d leave me on read for like a month. Again, thats what I expected, things get weird, we stop talking. 

But the part I really don’t fucking get is why the fuck she’d keep actually texting back after a month. I rarely initiated conversations, occasionally I did, but mostly I wanted the ball to be in her court. And she texted pretty much every month without fail, just outta the blue. But then she’d seem super uninterested in actually having a conversation, then leave me on read for another almost as soon as we start talking.

After she did that enough, I was confused enough to just ask her outright what the fuck was going on and she acted like things were the same as they’d always been. Said nothing was wrong at all. But it clearly fucking was, we used to text for hours. But if she didn’t wanna be friends at all, then why bother texting at all, especially if I’m not? It’s fucking infuriating, I don’t get it. And then the last time we spoke was after I asked if she wanted to hang out again cause I was in town, she “forgot” to reply, and then we had a short conversation where she left me on read again and that was the last I’ve fucking heard from her. That was 7 months ago.

She’s also sent me a “merry Christmas” text every year since we met and I didn’t get one this year, so I’d assume between that and the 7 month guess I’m just left to assume she’s finally let it die. It just fucking infuriates me that she wasn’t just honest when I asked her outright. Apparently I meant so little to her that she would rather make me constantly second guess for like a year whether I even still had a friend and lie to me, instead of making herself slightly uncomfortable for the duration of one fucking conversation where she just told me the truth to save me from having to go through that. That’s just fucking disrespectful, and I get that I’m fucked up, but I was pretty upfront about that from the beginning cause this was exactly the situation I was trying to avoid and she was the one who was too stubborn to listen at the time.

I just fucking hate people, and being this fucking angry at everyone in my life is making me wanna fucking cut myself all over but I can’t even do that anymore cause I can’t stand looking at the scars it leaves. Fucking hate being on this bullshit fucking planet."
Pale_Oxymoron,2022-01-01 09:42:06+00:00,I blame myself,"Years ago, there was a guy who asked me out a few times in front of his friends.  The last time, he asked why when I said no.  In a bid to prevent further attempts on his part, I told him it was because he was ugly.  In reality, I had an unexplained fear of him I didn't understand myself.  After that rejection (which got him laughed at by his friends), he began stalking me.  He was always anywhere I went, talking to me.  He took pictures of me.  He harassed my friends about me.  He said disgusting things and threatened me sexually.  He sexually assaulted me three times (only the first time didn't include penetration).  People ask why I didn't get help.  The people I told didn't help me (said they couldn't), so I stopped trying to ask for help and just tried to protect myself.  My brother taught me self-defense moves, but in the moment, I froze.  One day, he killed himself.  I never found out what was in the note and never asked or said anything to his family.  I logically know that it doesn't make sense, but I feel like his suicide is my fault.  I can't make my emotions (mostly guilt) match logic.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  Most people who know me don't know what he did.  My friends all knew about the stalking, but I was too ashamed to tell them about the assaults.  I mean, I should have been able to protect myself from him, right?  Especially after the first time.  There is no excuse for me to let him do it three times.  I should have kept trying to get help.  I should have just accepted his advances in the beginning.  How can what happened to me not be my fault?  One officer did nothing, but maybe another would have?  I don't know.  I've been a mess sense then and I've only told two people about these feelings and about all 3 assaults.  I don't know if I could ever forgive myself."
Healthy-Shirt-6869,2022-01-01 07:28:12+00:00,accepting misery," 

Christmas brings with it an air of aversion and despond, my refuge is the bush and marsh in my back yard, nature's detachment from this emotional roller coaster has a calming effect that no medical professional can prescribe.

I am miserable at the best of times, misery is like a faithful companion that never betrays me, it's consistent in its loyalty and shields me from the obligation of putting up a phony front. I have no issues with being straight up frank and opinionated with myself...less arguments.

In general, I'd love to be an optimist, but I doubt it would work out. Optimism is a superficial facade that creates an impression that all is well and can only get better when in reality it's only a delay of the inevitable. Fate will determine the inevitable, not a superfluous event like Christmas.

More (useless) stuff does not make one happy, material gain is a temporary euphoria that requires constant upgrades with no limits attached and it seems that nobody is ever satisfied. Pleasing people is an exercise in futility."
Ok_Turnip6019,2022-01-01 05:55:12+00:00,"Hey, quick new years message to everyone here who feels alone, forgotten, hopeless..","This night is notoriously shitty and I just want to extend my love to everyone else on here who is having a hard time getting through the night. I'm not going to say ""happy new years!!"" because I think we can all agree that hearing that phrase is so fucking annoying and invalidating when all we feel is overwhelming hopelessness, and I'm not going to try and give a stupid speech about how ""maybe things can get better so keep ur head up!!"" and all that kind of shit.

I'm just going to say that I'm so sorry that you all have to go through this kind of pain on the one night where everyone else you see is so hopeful and excited for the future. I'm sorry that you have to spend this night thinking about how nothing has changed, or how everything has only changed for the worst, or mourning the life of your old self that used to be so innocently excited for the future just for all their dreams to be crushed. It's so fucking hard. It's heartbreaking. It's debilitating. But I want you all to know that no matter how alone we feel, we can at least have the fucked up kind of contentment in that at least there are so many others on here feeling the same pain as we are.

I have so much love for you all, and I really do hope that even just one thing changes for the better this year for all of us. I hope we all can find something that feels like it actually helps for once. Nobody here deserves to feel this kind of seemingly endless agony, no matter how much we might think we do. It's not fair. At fucking all. I just really hope that this message can at least make someone feel even somewhat cared for or less alone. I feel very alone and hopeless myself tonight and i want to extend some warmth to you, because thinking that someone might feel even slightly better by reading this will provide me some warmth as well. We all deserve warmth. Good luck tonight everyone."

SmeethGoder,2021-12-31 20:35:11+00:00,Stuck in the cul-de-sac,"Sorry if this post is against the rules/stupid and depressing. Just trying to list and remember what roads we've been down for treatment that've ended up being dead ends. I guess I try not to think about if a treatment is gonna work out when I start it, but I don't really have any hope anymore. Kind of just exhausted and burned out now

Things that haven't helped:
• CBT; outpatient, without meds until my weight got low and I was admitted for
• Inpatient for 3 months (OCD seemed to recede somewhat for almost 3 years, but emotionlessness, brain fog, depression, panic attacks seemed to take its place at the front until the OCD came back; now it's all at the front)
• Mindfulness (did something like 20 days of Headspace daily meditations, didn't seem to do anything at all, like I'm too foggy for it)
• Drum lessons with the YMCA (often felt too depressed to go and didn't enjoy it when I did)
• Counselling at college
• Group therapy for OCD
• EMDR
• Art psychotherapy (done it for a few weeks so far)

Medications we've tried:
• Sertraline (200mg, started in hospital; we thought maybe it caused the emotionlessness, but that didn't stop when I wasn't on any meds so unless it permanently screwed me it seems unconnected)
• Olanzapine (10mg(?), started in hospital; made it really hard to wake up)
• Propranolol (GP put me on it after I was discharged and not on any meds, she thought it might help anxiety; I seem to be constantly anxious but not sure if it'd be worse without it)
• Vortioxetine (no effect it seemed)
• Venlafaxine (no effect it seems)
• Quetiapine (no effect it seems, might interfere with sleep but not sure)
• I might've been on Citalopram shortly
• Kalms, if they count (no effect as far as I can remember)"

RemoteElevator4765,2021-12-31 18:35:42+00:00,Gf left me after a year of living with her,I don't really know where to start but she made me the happiest I have ever been in my life from the moment we first met. The first time I met her it felt like something was physically pulling me towards her and just being around her made me feel more than just happy. Then she met someone that is more her type and age that I knew personally and she seems attracted to him and I was really jealous then we started dating and I moved in to her apartment to help out with bills and help take care of her and it made me so happy and made me feel like I had a purpose in this world for once in my life. We ended up moving out of the apartment and into a house that she baught in only her name but I had to use all of my savings to help her get it and I was working a shitty paying job at the Tim and couldn't afford much really but I managed to help pay bills still and pay the fees to get out of the apartment on short notice. I eventually got my dream job that pays alot more and was so estatic about it cause I was achieving my dream with her and everything was going amazing I thought then she started to spend more time with the friend of mine that she met and they where working on her car every weekend instead of her spending time with me or letting me even go and help with her car and I got more jealous and scared out of my mind by this cause I just knew that they both liked each other and didn't want her to leave me for him. Then last month they where texting when we where in bed and I managed to see that he had called her a pet name and I got saddened and upset by it so I just layed there not knowing what to say. It came time to sleep and she was cuddling me like she did when we went to sleep she must have noticed that I was upset and asked if I something was wrong and she hadn't asked that for months even though it was obvious I was not ok. I then asked her if she even cared and then proceeded to break up with me after talking for a few minutes. And she was trying to be really nice about it. She also told me that her and the friend where just friends and that he had a gf but he's the kind of guy who doesn't care and would cheat on someone in a heartbeat.  Every day I can't stop thinking about her and I miss all the times we had together and just being near her and holding her and now I'm back living with my parents who won't stop bringing things up and just overall stress me out even more and I don't have any money saved to get an apartment or a house. And at this point I just feel like I was used but I don't want to believe it cause she was so caring you until a few months ago and I don't know what to do all I want to do is go to her and and talk to her and basically begg her to give me another chance and I don't even know what I did wrong and I am just scared as hell right now not knowing where my life is heading and shit just seems to be happening really fast but slow at the same time and I have no clue on what to do with my life anymore.

JustEuthanizeMe,2021-12-31 14:36:26+00:00,Another piece of shit fucking year…,"I know there’s probably a billion fucking people thinking this same exact thing right now. But fuck man, all NYE is to me at this point is a reminder that the years are ticking by and everything keeps getting fucking worse. Not even talking about the virus bullshit, my shit was still well and truely fucked back when Corona was just a beer. Guess it hasn’t fucking helped anything either though.

Didn’t think I’d feel more shitty than this time last year. Spent NYE last year trying to drink myself into an early grave and doing rails of coke someone I’d never met gave me in a bathroom. First memories of 2021 were spent being so fucking hungover I couldn’t stand up without feel like I was gonna pass out. But somehow, here is it, stone cold sober and it’s way worse. 

Every single year I feel like it’s taken every last thing I had, and every year the next year reminds me of what little I had left by taking that too. But thinking about what I lost in 2021 isn’t just depressing cause I lost it, it’s mostly depressing to think that those things were really all I had going for me. Depressing to think I was surviving on such fucking table scraps and even those were taken. 

Started the year with I job I fucking hated, but one that let me afford my shitty, cockroach ridden shoebox of an apartment so that I could live alone. It was a fucking gross apartment, but at least I was free in it. If I was still there I’d be blasting music over speakers rather than having to use headphone like I do right now. But I got way too fucking depressed to be able to work and had to move back in with my toxic fucking mother, just like always fucking happens when I claw my way outta here.

Moving back in with her cost me every fucking freedom I had. We got another wave of covid here almost immediately and since my mums such a paranoid control freak, she won’t let me leave the house (says she’ll kick me out if I ignore her and leave anyway), can’t go to the fucking gym anymore, can’t ever be alone cause her and her fucking husband are always here, she even opens my fucking mail “in case the envelope has covid”. It’s fucking ridiculous, I’m fucking 22 and I feel like a fucking teenager again.

Also had the last smouldering embers of my one and only friendship I’ve had this lifetime finally get snuffed. It was realistically treading water when the year started, but I guess I didn’t realise how much I still valued the once per months she’d text me outta the blue and the 4-5 consecutive replies I could get outta her before she was gone again. Been 7 months now. Knew it was officially dead when I didn’t get a “merry Christmas” text. She always used to send one. 

A day later the last of the two goldfish she bought me died. Didn’t think that’s bother me, I didn’t even fucking want them, specifically told her not to get them at the time. But again, it was just one more thing I had but don’t anymore. Probably all for the best though. Didn’t want the goldfish, knew when she bought they’d probably wind up being a reminder of a friend I’d lost. 

Fuck her though, she clearly wasn’t interested in being friends for months, glad she finally grew up and stopped checking in each month. Probably only did it to make sure I wasn’t dead, guess all it takes in one little suicide attempt and all of a sudden people feel the need to fucking put you on life alert at all times like you can’t be trusted to take care of yourself. Can’t wrap my head around why she’d fucking bother anymore though, she pretty clearly didn’t fucking care to spend any time or even really talk with me while I was alive last year, so why the fuck does it matter to her if I was dead? 

So yeah, 2021 took my last few freedoms and autonomy, the last thing I had that even sorta resembled a friendship, my pets that I low key didn’t even want. Can’t wait to fucking see what 2022 reminds me I have only to fucking rip out from under me. Maybe it’ll finally be the year I get it all over with and kill myself. Not like I have anything to stick around for. Don’t fucking enjoy anything anymore at all. And my life is just gonna be a constant loop of moving out, getting my freedom for a while until my mental health cripples me, stops me from being able to work, and forces me back to my mum’s. Got no future anyway."
Herge2020,2021-12-31 10:00:33+00:00,Endless waiting for effective treatment,"I was sitting on the couch this morning with the dogs while watching TV (Star Trek Discovery) and I started to cry. No real reason, it just started. I'm 50 years old and have experienced episodes of various severity for as long as I can recall. I've had the usual gambit of antidepressants and CBT etc with no positive response. They now think that it may be rooted in ASD or ADHD but I have to be assessed for those first before they consider different treatment for my depression, obviously all of this takes time. This COVID thing is dragging out waiting times due to staff shortage and hospital policy as well as the festive period. 
I continue to practice the CBT, NLT etc in the hopes it will carry me through but I am finding it extremely challenging at the moment.
I have family and I am incredibly stubborn when it comes to a challenge so I hopefully will be okay in the short term. 
Does anybody have any experience in being diagnosed with ASD/ADHD and how is it treated. Does the treatment for that ""help"" with the low mood or is it treated separately?
Thanks in advance for any replies. Stay safe people."
Change_Queasy,2021-12-31 09:33:12+00:00,My father and my brother hate each and i mean HATE ! Which is affecting the entire family .,"Hello, so this is my first post on reddit . Idk why i came here but i need some advice . So My brother has always hated my father for a long time . Previously it wasn't that serious . He just avoided him and just never talked to him because my father is kind of short tempered and really raises his voice a lot when he wants to prove a point which he got from Navy and probably because he has more or less ruled over his employees with an iron fist kind of like a king ( ps this was in 1970 ish ) . So sometimes he used to treat us like his employees . This was totally subconscious as it was the way he spoke . But apart from that he is like the ideal father , at least to me . Back in the day he was more mean and more strict but you know how people change with time . 

On the other hand, my brother had been publicly humiliated by my father a few times as back in the day and still sometimes today my father thinks public humiliation is a great parenting tool 😑 .  But if you do it too much the child will gradually loose respect for you.  Also we were struggling with money when my brother was growing up and had a rough childhood as asian children do . But my brother was a fairly good student before his final high school exams . Where my parents switched his curricular language from english to our native language as he got admitted to a really great school but that school didn't have English so he had to give his final exams in a different language then he is used to and failed . From there things took a turn for the worse . My father was slightly mad at him at the start but i don't think he was that disappointed as he knew my brother tried his hardest and also bought him a laptop. After that the rest of his college days went smoothly and then came time to apply for a university . So my brother was dead set on just applying for 1 university which he studied for a lot . He even told mom and dad that he wil not try for any other university . In the end he wasnt able to get into the public university he wanted and had to go into a private university , which costed a shit ton of money .  Still my father provided the money . But after the first 2 semesters  my father had cancer and he had to go abroad with my brother for checkup . So my brother had to drop one semester . Before he didnt really like his university that much but after coming back he didnt really care anymore about his university and"

I love my daughter and would do anything for her and I'm not going anywhere anytime soon.   I have been focused on her 24/7 since my divorce and I've been depressed for a while now.   Just feel like anything I do is not good enough.   I'm not a bad looking guy, but im not hot by any means.   I find it hard to get back out there because I'm afraid of the heartbreak,  afraid of bringing another woman into my daughter's life and having them leave.   I can't take that pain of her getting attached and her getting heartbroken again.   I have dated a few women since the divorce but things went sour and luckily my daughter didn't get to know the ladies but I still could see she was heartbroken.  I'm alone and lonley.  I just don't know anymore.   I don't know what to do where to go.   It's hard because I had to move my daughter and I in with my parents because of the divorce and lost my job due to a back injury.   Now I did some side jobs for my friend brother,  but it hardly covers everything I need, but I am learning a lot.  Everyday I come home and I'm in a tremendous amount of pain.   Now my dr found an issue with my neck and more issues with my back.   It hurts to walk, too stand, to sit.   Everything hurts.   What woman wants a 36 year old jobless man who lives at home with his parents and has a bad back?  The depression makes me not want to leave the house but I know I have to do I can provide for my daughter.   Even when I feel terrible,  I still get up for her and make sure she has everything she needs.  I apologize this post is all over the place but I can't turn to my friends.   The ones I do have either turn it around and make it all about them,  don't want to hear or,  or say I'm a man sick it up.   They make it seem like men are not allowed to be depressed,  but just because we put a smile on and keep going didn't mean everything is alright.   Men are allowed to not be okay.   Men are allowed to have feelings and be depressed too, but why when we ask for help,  nobody wants to help us?"

JustEuthanizeMe,2021-12-31 01:43:14+00:00,Fucking sick of feeling traumatised just from staying alive,"Hate to call it “feeling traumatised”, cause nothing traumatic is really even happening. But every fucking day feels like that scene in every war movie, where someone looks at all the death around them with that thousand yard stare. My eyes feel glassy all the fucking time and if I stop and stare for too long, my ears start ringing. I’m losing presence in my own body. 

But it’s fucking stupid. I haven’t been in a war. I haven’t just watched hundreds of people die, or fought for my life. I just woke up and tried to make it through to the end of the day. That’s not heroic. It’s something most people wake up and do every fucking day without batting an eye. 

Used to be I feel like I’d go through a range of different emotions, even if most of them were shitty and unhealthy. But for a good while now, I’ve just been in this weird state of mostly numb with the last embers of rage smouldering somewhere in me, but it’s too weak now to access now. Sometimes I listen to the right music and that fans the flames a bit, but more than anything that just makes me sad, realising that I’m too numb to even feel rage properly. 

I don’t even know why I’m still here to be honest. There’s no experiences I’m hoping to have, no places I’m hoping to go. I don’t enjoy anything about this life. I’ve isolated myself for years, so no people around to miss me. Seriously, no one. Only had one friend ever anyway. And that was such a turbulent, chaotic shitshow because of me that she doesn’t even talk to me anymore anyway. Made me realise friendships really aren’t for me at least. 

And relationships aren’t either, never had one, don’t want one. Sure maybe sometimes I want sex or honestly mainly just someone to hold, but I can’t handle all the emotional shit you gotta go through to get to that point with someone. Maybe if I could somehow skip the build-up, the getting to know you phase, straight to the part where you’re 100% comfortable with each other like you’ve known each other your whole lives. Skip straight to the part where we she knows me so well that she doesn’t need to ask me questions about my past. Where she knows I don’t wanna talk at all most of the time. Think it’s pretty fucking obvious to see why that doesn’t work and why I’m not ready for relationships. And hell, sometimes I can’t even handle the intimacy part that I claim to actually want, so a relationship would be a mostly negative experience for me.

Just sick of feeling like I’ve got a thousand-yard stare when nothing is even fucking happening to me. Kinda wish it would, at least I’d have a reason to feel like this. Daydream about getting into fights and losing so that I can feel something for a while, feel bruised and bloody and be able to justify feeling traumatised. Used to cut myself but I fucking hate the scars that left so I’m trying not to do that shit. Just fucking hate feeling so fucked just from waking up in the morning."
evanie1337,2021-12-31 01:41:46+00:00,something,"hey
i’ve been depressed since i can remember, and finally decided to reach out for help.
my parents work 24/7, i barely get to see them, i begged them to send me to a doctor for a long time but they seem to not give a fuck, i don’t blame them
a psychologist isn’t technically a doctor but i guess it’s a start. the appointment lasted for like 2 hours and i was asked basic questions as i predicted, my mother got called in the room when it was over. basically the “doctor” told my mom that i appeared to show signs of depression and apathy which is fine i guess but it really was weird to see my mom finally realize what’s wrong with me. on the 22nd i have an appointment with a psychiatrist, hoping i get diagnosed with something as soon as i get outta there. I’m sure someone will give me medication cause what else will they do? will they turn my life around and completely change my routine? nah bruh, i bet i will be taking some temporary anti-depressant shit that will do nothing but change my mood a little bit. I want to feel something, i want to have at least one friend over the course of my lifetime, i want to have at least one relationship. Medicine won’t do any of this, will it? sometimes i look at the people at my school, so innocent, so vivid, and here i stand, so apropos.

s_ishaan,2021-12-30 20:32:04+00:00,I don't know what to do,"Some context. I'm a 20 year old guy from a lower middle class family who's fat, bald(yes), and short. Basically I'm far from a guy a girl would fall for. I think I have decent personality, but the hairfall thing really fucked my confidence and if girls don't wanna go out with me it's something I understand. But none of it is my fault. I crave physical touch and intimacy and acts of love. I want somebody to ask me how I am. How my day was. Somebody I can tell stuff and feel safe and list goes on and on. But I can't, because I don't know what could've gone wrong if I had hair on my head like every 20 year old out there.
 I didn't do very well in the parents category, so now I have people who're supposed to love you unconditionally telling me almost everyday they wished I wasn't born and things. I try really hard, but never finish up to the mark for them. Or anyone for the matter I'm never just enough I always have to do so much for people to hang with me. I got into college last year, but covid fucked things up and I haven't been there ever. I really wanted a hostel and everything so I could just stay away from everyone I know, and maybe even start fresh. And I'm not saying I wanted a hostel so I could stay away from supervision and whatever. I like studying stuff, but for some reason I don't want my parents to find out I'm studying. Maybe I don't want to raise their hopes and stuff. I just wanted to get away. And there was so much I could've done in college. But now I gotta spend another 4-5 months at home. Sometimes I wish I wasn't there. Because it's hard to see a future sometimes. 
Things haven't been on track for the last 3 years, and there's constant loneliness. I have a small circle, but it's just for convenience. As in they're friends with me only when they're in need and throw me out as soon as they find new people."
uckfu,2021-12-30 15:47:04+00:00,I’m feeling that if I ever get to the point I break down and cry finally I’ll be ready for the end,"Life just gets heavier and heavier. The past year, I’ve been trying to recuperate from a prostatectomy after a prostate cancer diagnosis. I knew I would not be happy after that surgery. But, the end result of my diagnosis is, I’m incurable. I’m taking hormone treatments, chemo drugs, and steroids to suppress the cancers growth. It works, but for &lt;10 years before you succumb to cancer. So without a cure, I’m waiting for that to happen. 

I knew going into the treatment i should plan on the worst case scenario of a 2 year recovery from the surgery. I had my head wrapped around that. I knew I’d hate it. I knew I’d hate the hormone therapy. 

Once I got there, it’s been a struggle, since everything is harder. Things weren’t great before that. Now they are worse. Before I had a hopeful outlook on the next ten years. Now, that hope is diminishing. I’m just looking forward to the end. 

I know I’m depressed and I have zero interest in seeing a therapist. Little mental exercises and homework to think positive aren’t going to help. Fuck that, I’d feel it would be condescending. I don’t want drugs to cope. I’m already neutered physically, I don’t want that mentally. I don’t have a chemical imbalance. I just realize my place in the world. I’m a statistic and don’t mean much in the grand scheme of things. I was just here to replicate and move over. 

I’m doing the things I like to do. But, I grow frustrated by those things at times. I know I can’t do them as well as I can and I’m reaching an impasse on how much I can accomplish before the decade of life is over and I’ll be possibly dying. 

My kids, I want them to ducking engage with me and do things together. I’m doing things with my dad, so he has that for when I’m gone. But they are teens and wrapped up in their own world. They always were. 

I don’t feel I’m bad with them. I meet lots of kids In my hobbies and i enjoy spending time helping them and they seem to enjoy hanging out with me. I’m not unapproachable. I try to engage them, but crickets from ‘em, unless they want something. It’s partially the age, but this is ridiculous at times. 

Anyways, I always felt like I’d have been happier being never born. That thought just gets louder in my head everyday. 

All I have to do is stop taking my meds and I’ll be heading towards oblivion in no time. It will be sad and scary, but fuck, it will feel so good to not have anymore consciousness. No worries and no more struggling. 

I do think, once I finally breakdown and cry, that’s it. I’ve been broken. I’m almost there. I haven’t yet since December 24 of last year when I woke up in completely discomfort of the recovery situation and a tube shoved up my urethra, hoping it would be removed that day and it would stop feeling like my dick was going to fall off."

When I learned about depression in middle school, I disregarded it because the description was exactly like my own regular experience; I thought it was just another way the adults were trying to manipulate me into doing pointless things. What they called ""feeling down"", I thought of as ground level. But now I can tell that I'm horribly depressed.

Mostly what I feel is that I'm hopeless... it's too late... it's in my nature to be doomed, and I'll have a slow, agonizing death because of that nature. Anything I could do only accelerates that fate.

When does it ""get better""?

It feels as though no matter how much progress I make I will always fall back to square one. I do things to distract and busy myself, but in the late hours when I can't sleep all I can think about is how I don't truly matter. There's always gonna be somebody out there that matters more to the people I care about, and I'm not really good at anything. When does this mentality stop? Others I talk to blame it on different factors, even my therapist thinks I can control this feeling I have. And I've told her I can't. I can't think any other way. People telling me it gets better feels like a blatant lie. Sometimes I feel like they say it to make THEMSELVES feel better,
 
I don't know if I even technically or medically have depression. 

I have good days, sure.. sometimes. 
But mostly it just sucks. And I just feel like I'm wasting...
And even dying...
What is that called? And when does it stop?"

CrewIndependent9252,2021-12-30 03:17:54+00:00,My friends all dropped me and I'm depressed and can't move on.,"A few months ago I got a gift for a girl in my friend group that I was crushing on. I didn't get to give it to her in the end so I told her best friend that I was planning to give it to the girl I liked. She said it was sweet and she'd love it and asked if she could tell her about it. Due to the positive response I got from her closest friend if seven years I assumed it would be alright for her to find out.

Fast forward to the next day and I get a text from my crush saying she wasn't interested and didn't want to talk to me again. I thought this was pretty extreme and as you can imagine I was very upset by it. Suddenly her best friend texts me saying I ""have to respect her boundaries"" even though I hadn't communicated with her since the rejection. She kept saying that i was trying to ""buy her into a relationship"" and that I was wrong for even considering getting her something which is the complete opposite of what she was saying the previous day.

After that, her and her friends stopped texting me. Starting gradually by them only giving me one word replies when I'd reach out to them onto leaving me on read and then just completely dropping me from their friend group.

It's been several months now since this event happened and I still think about this every single day. I really loved my friends and I keep thinking what it was that I did wrong or what I could've said or done differently. Most people's advice would be to ""move on"" or ""focus on yourself"" but in order to move on I feel like I'd have to get some closure from my old friends.

She answered with some valid points and explained how she saw life as a whole, and gave reasons for why they shouldn’t do it, also telling me how she’d feel if someone close to her or a family member did it, and honestly, I don’t know anymore, mainly because of how she’d feel if I did it, I still feel like it’s the right thing to do, but on the other hand, I’m starting to have doubts, I just don’t know anymore."

This year?
If I don’t move out by at least the end of this year, (which is already highly unlikely) i might just be. But then again, probably not, because somehow i am still here, despite how bad its been.
So if this year is worse, I’ll probably still be here. Even though it hurts so, so badly.

I have so few pleasures left in life now, as nothing brings me joy anymore. I feel like I’ve lost my identity.

I feel like I’m dead. Like I’m not living, but just observing, Like nothing is real.
I don’t feel anything. I’m always numb.
And such a lack of motivation, like I’ve had the life sucked out of me.
I feel dead.

I can’t exist like this anymore.
Every day is a waste. My pastimes are now just complete sensory deprivation, eating, and browsing the internet (only to get bored within 5 minutes) everything is a trigger now, except for sleeping and sensory deprivation.

I have nothing left. 

I need somewhere else to live, for a start. Not because of family issues or anything, (except my sister who is very hard to live with) but just because i need to escape. I need a new start so i can start to improve my life.
I know i’m young, but i can’t begin tell you how much i need this. 
If you could recommend any housing plans or any kind of housing for 16 year olds that would be brilliant.

It hurts to carry on like this, and i don’t think i can hold on any longer. It’s killing me.
It would be greatly appreciated if you could get back to me or suggest anything, or just something to help cope better with this crippling emptiness.

Thank you so much for reading. &lt;3"

That makes it so easy for my family and friends to dismiss my problems as ""fake,"" as there is no physical evidence of it on my face/body. I wish it caused our eyes to turn yellow, our hair to fall out, our veins to become more prominent under our skin--maybe then my family would believe me."
Passion4Letters,2021-12-29 18:28:36+00:00,I don’t belong anywhere,"Hey there! guy here and boy what can I say? I’m feeling devastated, alone, sad, that I have nobody to count or relly on. 

As stupid as it may sound? I’m a guy that enjoys videogames, writing, drawing at times. While I do work and keep myself occupied there’s times in the day that I find myself alone. That’s where my mind starts haunting me. I start thinking on sad things, how I am all by myself, how I will suffer alone, how despite me trying to be well mannered and spoken nobody welcomes me anywhere. And I’m not talking about women problems. I’m talking about me not being able to fit in anywhere! 

For instance. I met this former halo professional guy in a writing site, we talked, shared some ideas and he even told me “hey we should game sometimes” at first I was a bit hesitant about it because he being a former professional was a scary thing. His skills are out of this world but after thinking on it? I decided to give it a try. 
We exchanged Discord names and once I got the free to pay games that we were supposed to game we did. 
It was fun, his skills were like i said tremendous! I must confess, he is what i wish I was back when I was young. As a videogame enthusiast I always wanted to be top tier in skills. 
Unfortunately since he was retired from the pro scene his liking for gaming became bitter and with a professional mindset he was always complaining about his team. 
To make this long story short. We have been gaming ever since we met. 2 years by now and it seems that he doesn’t want to game anyone. And you know what? That does sound stupid. Listen to me! Read me! I’m being such a stupid cry baby for something so petty. I cannot believe myself. It’s so idiotic. I am being idiotic. I don’t belong in his group or friend group because we are nothing alike. And i should find my own group of friends or at least people that’ll might enjoy gaming with me. 

I’m so very very sorry for coming to post this stupid rant in here. But i can attest that i do suffer from crippling loneliness because back before I met him? I was alone, have always been, and gaming, writing, drawing and working has always been key components to keep my sad, depressing thoughts away from my mind. I’m such a stupid idiot for thinking or even relating those two things. 

I need to find either a group of my own or even cope with the sadness that envelops me everyday. I have to make the sadness and loneliness in me either part of me or reject them completely. As making them part of me I need to make them my own. As in, walk hand in hand. Know and acknowledge that no matter how good, friendly, serious, smart, witty or anything? I’ll never fit in on a group of people or even society. That i am all alone in this world and that i will go alone. The thought is overwhelming and it’s saddens me but i cannot do anything else at all. 

All I can do is be strong, embrace my loneliness, my depression, my sadness and make them my armor. Make them the shield I need to protect myself from all harm. 

This helped me. Thank you for allowing me in this place and again. I’m so sorry for this stupid rant. I hate it, i have hated it a ton. I hate being alone, sad, depressed. With my thoughts. 

But i have to endure. For how long? I don’t know. 

Thank you all."
311lookitup,2021-12-29 17:34:43+00:00,I cant escape depression in my own home.,"I have been battling with a dilema that just doesn’t seem to leave my mind. It’s a bit of a constant torment and i realize there is no solution so i would like to vent. 

So this is a bit of a love triangle situation but no really. I M26, person i like F26 and other friend M26 both like the same girl. 

So to start of i should explain that we all work together, i have had a crush on lets call her Ash since a started working at my job. I realistically knew that nothing could happen because one she was a colleague and 2 she was way out of my league. So kept it profesional and moved on. 

We had a new hire, lets call him mike. He fit in with our small team, we all eventually became friends, very close friends between the 3. He admitted to me that he actually likes Ash as well. He is unaware that I’ve liked ash for sometime and I don’t believe i will ever admit that to it either way. 

All 3 of us spend alot of time out of work together, we drink, we hang out and eat dinners more often than not and currently Mike is my roommate  . Ash has stated in the past that she only sees us (Mike and Me) as friends and co-workers. I got the message no need to further push the issue. Well that was a few moths ago. They got some weekends off at the same time giving them more time to hang, plus right now I’m not currently at work so they have gotten a lot of time together. Things might of changed between them and even though it breaks my heart cause i really liked this girl, i have suspicions that they might of hooked up or are about to. 

Like i said we are very close so they tell me about nights were they stay up very late just hanging out, they lately had a lot of those nights. She has told me in the past that she only sees him as a friend but like i said things might of changed and wether it hurts or not i have to accept that it’s happening and its out of my control. I absolutely understand that nothing might ever happen between me and ash but it’s painful to think that she is fucking mike a few feet away when i go to sleep. She stays on our sofa for some of those late nights

Granted they are my co-workers and friends, how do i get over this. It’s painful to hear sometimes how they stay up late laughing and talking. I feel left out for one but i can just sense their chemistry building up. I would just like for this pain to end. Ive even considered requesting a transfer cause of how painful everything is. 

Also Mike was dating ash’s former best friend before he started working for us, thats actually how he got recommended to us. Ironically ash and her best friend had a falling out because she accused Mike and Ash of flirting. At the time Ash thought that it was ridiculous cause mike wasn’t her type and she would never do that to her best friend but things change and maybe the best friend wasn’t over reacting. 

This caused my depression to intensify by a lot these past few weeks. I just don’t know how much pain and sadness i can take. I accept that it was never meant to be, its still hurts seeing someone you have feelings for bond with someone else. Its torture from where i am."

Days before I was normal and playing with little my 2yo niece. Today I was basically hiding because I don't want anyone to see me like this, certainly not my niece! Let's just say that I had troubled childhood, so I don't want to happen to any kid.

 And I said to my family that I want to celebrate at home at different day. And today I just want to be alone reading a book, and that would make me happy.

Well they didn't respect my choice, like they almost never do. And as I was wreck my sister came to me with lil niece. She wanted to play, and I can't say no to her,..she is so innocent, I tried my best to act happy with her. Then I had to excuse myself because my ""mask"" stared to slip.

And I hate situation they put me in. I am so angry why can they respect my wishes on my f***ing birthday! And my niece was disappointed. F*** I was normal, playful and everythink yesterday and days before. Just this f***ing day I needed space!"

Big-Reply-8981,2021-12-29 10:54:50+00:00,Because of her (part)2,"Since my last post got awhile likes. I be posting part 2.

So at the time when I was dating my ex. I was 16 and she's 17 almost 18 and it was a hot summer day back in 2010. She ended up pregnant. It was a shock to us and as a 16yr I was scared and nervous. But will to step up. She had other plans I did not know about. And she got rid of the unborn. And stay with me. Broke my heart so deep. But we still stayed together. But after the break up she got with this one guy and they have 3 kids.. I called then bastards. She got rid of our child and end up giving another guy who she was kinda already talking to 3 kids and left me out of everything! I had people tell me what she was doing and she was trying to give him as many kids. As I'm crying hurting over her, she's with the new guy trying to start a family she could've had with me but no guessing I just wasn't good enough or something.  She block me on everything and posting all about her new happy family. And I'm here still in the dark, still hurting. Still remember everything we been thru. Still wishing she come back to me. But that would never happen, even when I try to imagine her and I getting back together.  When I come to reality it's like, weird like I wanna call her up and tell her I had thus image of us. But I can't she completely lost all emotions towards me. She way on moving on was getting knock up and screwed. Me!! I'm stock and don't know what I'm doing. It's been 10yrs and still I remember her smile, her laugh, and her touch.  She smelled so good everyday! Damn.. I'm tearing up now writing this... I'm that hurt, That broken.. dead Inside. 

I'm still knew to this app. I just have to get this and more off my chest. I have alot to get off. Rather this get likes or not I'm gonna pour my heart out.."
PandaMaven,2021-12-29 07:57:11+00:00,Winter break kinda sucks,"Christmas was the only good day I've had so far.

I've had to tell all of my online friends about my sh because I know that the sooner I tell people the better, but it was hard.

One good thing happened though.

Normally I have to be told or asked to take a shower because I am very forgetful and have trouble getting into a routine because of depression as well as other factors.

This morning I got up and just showered. No one was home, I just felt gross and showered. I didn't get anything else done, and that's more than I have gotten done every day since Christmas. I decided that even though it's a small thing, it was enough. Spent the rest of the day playing games, proud of myself. So at least that felt good."
Tin97,2021-12-29 07:12:55+00:00,"You know how to quickly realize, how much you suck at life?","Imagine, that you can have like 10 wishes, to change anything in your life. Mistakes from the past, some of your personality traits, or even maybe something about your body. Then imagine, how great your life would be...So you can actually enjoy it. So you could feel, what it's like to be a different, happy, normal person in this world. 

That makes me actually depressed. There's so many things i'd love to change, but simply can't. For a lot of reasons."

But the good ones disappear too. It makes me feel lonely and that life is pointless. Memories can make us feel happy, right? We all like to look back at the good times. 

Sometimes I feel nothing. I don't want to be alone. But it's also easier. But then I revisit suicidal ideation bc life feels pointless. 

Remind yourself of the good times when things get tough. You're fortunate to have memories stored in your menory bank. Sometimes we don't even realize the things we have to be thankful for."

SmeethGoder,2021-12-29 05:04:50+00:00,What does your average daily routine look like?,"Sorry, I dunno if it's a really weird thing to ask about, but I guess I just don't know how others' days usually look. You can be as detailed or not as you feel like.

Don't feel you have to read it, but here's mine as an example I guess.
Just as a heads-up, I have OCD and am generally a mental wreck so I do weird stuff and do stuff weirdly.

* I usually get up at some point between like 12:00 and 15:00, sometimes it can be earlier or later. On days where I have therapy, I think I usually get up between 07:00 and 08:00. Then I go to the toilet, get dressed (can take a while, especially socks and shoes as I have trouble getting comfortable), and brush my hair (can take a while for it to feel alright, and it always looks like crap anyway).

* Then I have breakfast on therapy days (usually a cereal bar and coffee to take my meds with (not that they seem to help)), or if it's afternoon, I'll go in the living room and sort out my seat on the sofa (takes a while to sort out) then have lunch (usually something like a pasty, a chocolate bar and Coke).

* Then there's usually a few incredibly slow hours until I have to start getting ready for dinner. I try to pass the time somehow; usually by going on the PlayStation, but that had to be moved to make table space for Christmas, and to be honest I didn't enjoy it anyway; I don't seem to enjoy anything anymore. In that few hours, I usually have 1 or 2 more drinks, depending on how long it's been since lunch or since the last drink and what time it is.

* Then, at some point, usually between 19:00 and 20:00, I start getting ready for dinner. I go to the toilet (can take a while), clean my hands, my face and my arm (if it feels like there's something on my mouth or my mouth feels dirty, I rub it on my arm to 'clean' it), brush my hair again and sort out my seat again. Then have dinner and a drink to have my evening tablet with.

* Then to be honest I usually end up scrolling through social media on my phone or watching YouTube videos, and I might have one more drink.

* Eventually I have to get ready for bed, it's usually around 01:00 or something. I might brush my teeth (I don't do them when I get up, not time to really, but like the majority of nights I try to), I go to the toilet, then sort out the pillow and bed (can take a while to get it 'right'), brush my hair (it just seems really uncomfortable if I don't), close the door and get in bed. I might get out and get back in if I'm especially uncomfortable.

Sorry, I know, I'm pathetic and lucky to be able to leech off my family rather than being an actual valid contributing member of society. The lady I'm seeing for therapy said I've given up on life, and she's probably right. I don't want to be awake

Sorry/thank you if you read all of this. I wasn't sure how to write it and probably waffled and rambled because I'm dumb"

Many past attempts were overdoses, car collisions, or just very impulsiveness attempts on my life.

But this time I feel so numb and worthless almost as if I want to plan it properly. 

My depression is so crippling that I don’t leave the house other than to get weed. All my day consists of is smoking weed , sad songs, and just a really dull feeling. 

The best part of my day is thinking about death, thinking about how, when , what will happen. 
It gives me hope, not hope of living but hope of dying soon ,to be gone from this shithole.

I wish every day that I could have an easy way out but death isn’t easy when u have no balls. Through my life I had 10 or so serious attempts on my life , but I always end up pulling through.

But now I’m thinking and acting on detailed ideas of death. I look out my windows and see a very tall construction building with scaffolding leading right up.
All I can imagine is falling from the height then bam I’m dead.
I’m free , free from this torment."

I don’t have anyone to open up to, even my parents don’t believe that I’m suffering from depression, they think it’s some kind of phase, it’s not, it’s been way harder lately, so hard that during the last 5 months even my music taste completely changed, I can’t even listen to anything mainstream anymore, the only things I’m able to listen to are rock and grunge sounds about, you named it, ending it all, I have no motivation whatsoever and nothing is enjoyable anymore, I spend my entire days laying on my bed crying and listening to music.

I don’t have any friends, and my parents don’t care so the excuse of transferring the pain to someone else doesn’t work, because no one will care or even notice, saying that it’ll get better is a lie, it never did and never will, I don’t even know if you should write a goodbye letter because no one will read it.

bry_flynnie,2021-12-28 00:18:24+00:00,I Don't Think Things Through and It's Ruining My Life.,"I'm fucking hate myself right now as I realize that my therapist was 100% right I don't think things through and I react on pure emotion without considering the consequences. My therapist literally said I'm no better the people who stormed the captiol in Jan. Recently I lost two great jobs, I ruinied relationships, I've caught an STD (thankfully I was able to get cured right away), and put myself in massive debt. 

I react emotionally and without thinking while most of the time it's meant to be positive and help people but sometimes its out of anger/spite/frustation. Either way it's killing me ruining my life. If a friend asked me for money I would give it to them without a moment of hesitation even if I literally don't have it. I've worked retail jobs and given people discounts just because I wanted to help them or stick it to corporation this has cost me a great job with a good potential future in the cannabis industry. And today I helped a stranger without a second thought because it seemed like it was no big deal even though I could get myself in big trouble and cost me more. 

I hate myself right now, I had such a good future ahead of me but because of my repeated implusive actions I feel like i have ruin my own life beyond repair. I've even put myself into my debt because I buy things for myself or others without thinking about my bills and needs first. I hate where I am in life and its all my fault. I feel like im falling closer and closer to hurting myself because I can't see a way out."
hobimilf420,2021-12-27 23:30:55+00:00,“You can live a fulfilling life without friends/alone” I’m tired of this saying.,"I had to see this phrase being directed at me this time when I commented under a video on Depression talking about some of the things that caused my depression. 

Loneliness was one of them. And someone told me that I can live a fullfilling life without friends. 

When I saw that comment I felt like the way I felt about not having friends made my depression less valid… such a silly thought..

I don’t think people understand what loneliness does to someone. I want friends. I want to have people to text everyday. I want people to hang out with on the weekends. Friends to FaceTime for 6 hours. Friends to have sleepovers with. Friends to cry and laugh with. People to do all the things I dream of doing with. People to travel with. 

I can’t live a happy and eventful life if I’m alone all the time. I always watch people my age with their friends, having the time of their lives as people in their 20s.

Then there’s me..

I cry over this all the time. I can’t take the loneliness. I don’t think I can live a happy life alone. I’m rarely ever happy."

Feeling so low about my self as a person recently I feel like I’m falling behind, I’m 22, single never had a girlfriend, never had sex, too ugly to get a girlfriend.. all my friends are buying houses with their partners.. I’m in knee deep debt, my credit score is below 100.. I have a drug addiction that I’m trying so hard to get over.. I feel like I’m just slowly failing at life. I have one positive thing on my side that I luckily landed a great job starting in February. But I’m too afraid my drug problem will interfere with it.. I feel like this post is pointless but I just needed to put this somewhere and I feel like Reddit is the only place I can do it comfortably."
nonmainaccount095,2021-12-27 23:19:36+00:00,Things started looking good but now I want to disappear,"(30NB) Things were starting to look up mid November - I got promoted, we got a cat. Life was going pretty well considering the shit show that the last year and a half was.

Then my step dad killed himself. I couldn’t attend his funeral. I missed my psychiatrist appointment. I got a court summons for a debt and it’s coming up to 16 years since my dad passed away

I’ve been trying to stay on top of things but I’m only one person. My fiancée is filing for bankruptcy but also trying to get disability. I’m planning to file bankruptcy as well but I found out today I won’t have enough for rent which means I won’t be able to pay the filing fee. My FSA denied one of my charges and I’m praying they’ll see it’s valid. And today, one of my front teeth crumbled. I need it extracted but I can’t afford it even with my dental insurance

If I don’t file bankruptcy before my summons date, my new promotion will mean nothing and I’ll be back to where I was before because of wage garnishment

I have therapy tomorrow and I’m almost dreading it. I’d made so much progress. We got groceries. We’re able eat. Kitty is able to eat. Which I know is the important thing. We never have emergency money. I messed up budget wise and I’m short for rent. I’ve never been late. I spoke to the office and they were able to tell me if I get the balance below $100 it’ll just be a small balance notice and I’ll be set by the 7th because I’ll be paid again. I still can’t get my teeth fixed and I’m just getting to the end of my rope and it feels like the destination is a deep dark pit

I’m still here because my fiancée is unemployed and financially relies on me. I wish I could give her more money so she has fun money. But I can’t right now. Christmas was a nice distraction for a very short few hours before life hit me like a ton of bricks

These last 6 months has felt like I’ve been trudging through the quicksand that is life and finally started being able to pull myself out and then more sand fell and I’m stuck again

The one thing I have to look forward to is I have the first week of January off to recover from my dads death anniversary but I know the week won’t go the way I want it. Every time I’ve taken time off to do nothing, something comes up and I barely get time to relax

I just want to start over I want to give my fiancée everything she deserves and more. But right now I just want to walk out the door and lose myself

(I hope formatting isn’t weird, I’m on mobile. And I’m sorry things are jumbled. I just can’t articulate well right now)"

ViniTobi2,2021-12-27 22:55:00+00:00,Something i always think about (TW: S*icide),"Ok, I'm just going to say it right away before somebody asks me about it, no, I'm not officially diagnosed with depression, but i AM diagnosed with Asperger's (or high functioning autism) and thus i have a lot of anxiety and a bit of a harder time socializing, however, last year in January of 2021, i finally turned 18, and one month from now, in the end of January of 2022 i will turn 19, or, technically speaking, my last year as a ""teenager"", even though I'm already officially an adult by law, the reason why I'm saying this is because, 2 years and 1 month from now, i will turn 20, and i know this might seem ""childish"" or ""embarrassing"", and I'm not sure if it is because of my autism or not, but i simply cannot fathom the idea of growing up and having to act and of course, worst of all, have all the responsibilities of a functioning adult, such as paying bills, for at least 50 more years before i begin to die of old age if medicine isn't developed enough to develop a ""cure"" for aging, you know, unlikely sci-fi stuff, either way, i'm not sure if I'm the only one who thinks like this, but because of this ""fear"" of growing up and accepting adult responsibilities for the rest of my life, I've even come as far as thinking of suicide and hoping to be reborn, or reincarnated, as a human again, so i can have the experience of a child's life for a little bit longer, and not have to stress about responsibilities as much, and just generally enjoy life and all the technology that might come in the future, and, if I'm lucky enough, be reborn as someone who doesn't have trouble socializing and who actually enjoys life, which is not me in the slightest, this was more of a vent than anything, but i want to know if i am alone in this type of thinking, hoping for a ""better life"" after dying before 20 and not having to worry about 50 more years like this, of course i have no proof of reincarnation, but even the thought of no longer existing, the thought of not being able to think at all, kind of like how before i was born, sounds nicer than living 50 more years in this trashy world and having lots of new adult responsibilities, even though I can barely motivate myself to even cook currently, so just the thought of working and being depressed on the weekends sounds like hell to me, so, reincarnation, heaven, or non-existence, literally anything that might happen after death, sounds better than my current situation, sorry for the long post, but i wanted to be as detailed as possible, to at least know if one other person feels exactly like i feel, or if i am even weirder than what I thought i already was..."
Big-Reply-8981,2021-12-27 22:37:40+00:00,Because of her.,I'm so depressed and ruin because of my ex gf. We met in 09 and she change my life. I was 15 and she was 16 almost 17. And we hit it great.

And I thought was good til we got into a argument and when I went over to her house. I felt the lost and pain. Her father was looking at me piss and I knew she finally broke down and told her parents everything and I shit myself. I did everything I could get her back and we hung out a few day but the damage was already down. And we broke up. Years later she know has s full loving family and a good life as I'm a slum and can't hold a job.

thingswontbeokay,2021-12-27 20:55:42+00:00,Creeped a girl out. I'm a piece of shit.,"I'm starting to question every romantic pursuance I've ever had now.

Basically, I matched with this girl a while back and we got to the point where she gave me her snap. When we switched over to snap, she didn't really message me anymore and so I left her alone.

Every once in a while, she'll post something on her story and I would react to it most of the time, and if it was ever a selfie I would give her a compliment like calling her pretty. 

Anyways fast forward to today, I reacted to her story where she went out with some friends and I said something like she was pretty. Later she posted on her story that she hates posting on snap because creeps message her and that they all need to learn to stfu. I then reacted and said ""lol is this in reference to me? If so I'm sorry"". She opened the message, and then at the same time posted on her story again ""yall really need to learn to stfu"".

I felt sick to my stomach. I really hated the fact that I was the creep that made her feel uncomfortable. I was going to leave her alone, but the situation was gnawing at me. I messaged her one last time just sending a thought out apology, and now I'm really leaving her alone forever.

I started really freaking out because I must've been doing this the whole time to every girl I liked. I'm thinking back to every other girl I go after and this isn't different from what I normally do, and most of them don't message me anymore. They typically just open the message and don't say anything. It sucks because in the past these were girls I really liked and I figured they either stopped liking me or never liked me to begin with because I'm uninteresting and unattractive, but now I know it's because of that plus I'm a creep.

I realize now I'm one of those pieces of shit that makes girls feel uncomfortable. It's cause of people like me that girls have a hard time making friends or dating. It makes sense why I haven't had a girlfriend. 

This just showcases how much of a fucking asshole and disgusting person I am. It really further justifies that I'm just not a good person. I feel so embarrassed and guilty and just can't believe I've been doing this. I'll never be able to look these girls in the eyes if I ever run into them. There's no way I can make this right. I can't believe I'm like this.


TLDR: I'm a piece of shit because I've been creeping girls out without realizing it. I message them too much when they post on snap calling them pretty and complementing their looks then trying to start a conversation. I feel like throwing up and I just hate that I'm like this."
Extreme-Might-6354,2021-12-27 20:40:15+00:00,Overprotecting mom takes away from me what i love for no reason,"Greetings!  I (15M) am in my first year of highschool and, after studying a ton last year, i entered a very good school. Everything goes really well there. I get good grades and i made a few friends. At the same time, i don't have bad habits, if you will. I mean i don't spend much time at all on my phone or on the computer (not that there is something wrong with that). Instead, in my free time, i mostly play electric guitar. I started doing so for 3 years and really love it. In the holidays i practice for at least 6 hours a day. It would be a dream come true to be a guitarist, but i think i will become an informatician.
     Anyway, what my mom does makes me truly sad. For background, we aren't a rich family, but certainly not poor and my mom has strugguled with anxiety since her childhod because her parents were quite restrictive, but also because she takes lots of stuff personal at work especially. Because of this my dad talks to her a lot about this. He is like a therapist from time to time.
     So, three years ago i went through something really difficult. My mom stopped going to work and, slowly, took away everything from me until i wasn't allowed to watch tv, use my phone because she hid mine and my dad's, go outside and she even hid my school books and shoes so that i would  be safe and i wouldn't get hurt outside (she says : being cautious didn't kill anyone). Fortunately, after one year of this hell my uncle (her brother) came to our place and, after yelling, screams and crying from her she went to the hospital where she spent a few months for depression. Also, i forgot to mention that during this period, she didn't go outside for ONE YEAR.
     After this, she returned home, but the same hell happened once again because she stopped taking anti-depressants. Fortunately, this lasted only a few months. After spending some time at the hospital and returning home, everything was alright again and it seemed to stay this way, but NO...  She stopped going to work and outside and closed her phone after one year. As long as this didn't affect my dad and i, it wasn't a problem, but this Christmas i bought with my money earned from school a guitar pickup (a component that picks up the sound) and to use i have to take it to the guitar shop (where i went countless times in the past) for it to be done by a luthier, but she doesn't let me do this. I didn't get anything for Christmas from my parents, but i got something for myself and she agreed at first, but now i can't use it. Also, i said to her that the perfect gift would be if she went outside, but she is still staying inside. At the same time, recently she forbade me to take guitar lessons anymore and i don't understand why. I calmly explained her that there are only benefits from the classes, but she says that she has her reasons (they aren't financial. I offered to pay myself the lessons).  She thinks that music and rock musicians especially (i play rock) are drug addicts and is afraid that i'll become one. I've always been responsible, but she doesn't trust me...
     So, WHAT CAN I DO? I don't want to go through another hell again. I don't deserve this. I can't be my mother's therapist. Also, my dad talks very calmly with her about all this, but she controls us and when dad tries to, for example, take me to the guitar shop, she says that we don't care about what she thinks and that she is a victim. 
     I can't wait to become an adult...
     Any advice would be much appreciated! (I apologise if my english isn't perfect, it is my second language)"

bitchy_cookie,2021-12-27 15:56:57+00:00,Feeling so low,"I don’t even know if this is the right sub to post in but I’m feeling so depressed. I’m a single mom to a little guy who is the light of my life and I share 50-50 custody with his father. Because of covid, I’ve been staying home unless I have errands to run or doctors appointments, especially for my sons sake. I don’t even go to the grocery store and I order groceries because I’m scared to get it and most importantly pass it to my son. I’m fully vaccinated with the booster but my son is too young. 

Anyways, the reason I’m feeling so down is because one of my girlfriends asked me to hang out and she is also fully vaccinated with the booster. I decided to hang out with her because I’ve been so lonely and am missing human interaction so much. I FaceTime with friends and talk on the phone a lot, but it’s not the same. She asked if I wanted to hang on New Years and I was so excited because I have spent the last few New Years alone and my son will be with his dad. Now this morning I woke up with the worst anxiety because I’m worried I did wrong by my son. I’m feeling like my actions of spending time with someone else were selfish and foolish and I’m putting my son at risk. I feel so low right now and don’t know if it’s mentally healthy to hang out with one friend occasionally or if I should just wait until this omricon surge gets better."

throwaway1294736251,2021-12-27 14:53:17+00:00,"My fish died today, and I don’t normally buy into this shit, but it felt eerily symbolic","I’m not someone who makes friends easily. At all. I have had plenty of “friends”, I guess, but I’ve ghosted 100% of those people. I start a job or something, pretend for a while, move away and delete all social media and everything to start over again. Done that cycle over and over again. Not exactly happy with it, but it really is the least shitty option for me personally. I guess being around people generally just makes me feel more alone than when I’m actually by myself. 

I did know one person once though, that didn’t make me feel like that. A girl I used to work with, we became friends pretty quickly and I guess we just had good chemistry or something. But I guess because my brain doesn’t know how to handle that, doesn’t have experience with genuine kindness, it went ahead and mistook it for love. But I knew the love was one sided so I never said anything. Then the love got ugly, turned to obsession. I tried to push her away because being around her was bad for me, but she didn’t really let me. Could’ve tried harder I guess, but part of me didn’t want to lose her either, even though I knew it would’ve been better for us both.

Long story short, I had a suicide attempt, a severe bout of self-harming and she kept supporting me through it for some reason. After I got outta hospital she even bought me two goldfish as a gift, I guess to give me a responsibility to prevent me from trying again. I told her not to, but she’s unyieldingly stubborn. 

But eventually my drinking problem crescendoed in a night of me blacking out and ending up in hospital, and apparently at some point I decided to text her how I felt. It was pathetic and it absolutely made things weird between us. She said we could still be friends, but I could tell it would never be the same as it was. 

Went through the whole push and pull thing of blocking her number and then unblocking it, wanting her gone, to wanting things to go back to how they were before. And it really didn’t help that she’d text me out of the blue once a month on average, making me think she still wanted some form of communication with me. Even left her on read for a full month only to have her come back with “good talk” after all that time. But the conversations also weren’t like they were before, used to text for hours and now I couldn’t get more than 5 replies before she was gone for another month. I was so confused about what she wanted, why she’d text first only to seem uninterested in actually talking. I know I should’ve ended it, walked away, but I guess I still didn’t know what I really needed. 

Anyway, fast forward to now and it’s been seven months since she texted. Our last conversation, she texted me first and then left me on read not long after. Then nothing. Guess I also had the discipline to not engage her again. I still wasn’t sure if she was done with me yet though, I figured the real test would be to see if she sends me a merry Christmas text. She’s done it every year since we met, so I figured if she didn’t do it this year, then I’d know. And low and behold, Christmas came and went and no text. Part of me felt relieved but part of me is absolutely fucked. Just gutted. 

And as if it was a fucking sign, the second of the two goldfish she bought me died last night. First one died last month, but it was clearly sick for about a week beforehand. This one seemed fine, right up until Christmas Day, I shit you not. And the next day, it just died. Not only that, but it actually swam up into the little plastic flowers that were in there, sort of cone shaped ones, so they were like little cups and it  sat itself inside the flower and a few hours later it was cupped in there on its side, not breathing. All I could think about was that scene from Half-Blood Prince where Slughorn talks about his goldfish disappearing the day Lily Potter died. 

I normally don’t buy into shit like this, and I do mostly think it was still just a coincidence, but man, something about the poetic imagery of that fishes death, dying in the flower like it did, at the exact time I realised my friendship was finally dead too. It’s just fucking rocked me. I thought I’d be mostly relieved when she stopped taking to me, but it hurt so much more than I thought it would. I guess she’s still the only person I’ve ever been able to connect with, so even though I know it’s better this way, it’s still depressing to think I don’t have anyone else in my life at all. But fuck it, I’ll get over it, guess I just needed to vent because of how weird of a coincidence the fish thing was."

I am on medication and utilizing therapy but these don’t seem like helping. I would love to go a psych ward to get extra help but I recently started a new job so I have no PTO saved up and I’m already in debt and i don’t really know where to go from here.

Every girl I’ve ever talked to has hurt me bad, so bad my “friends” always tell me I should stop being so hurt by it, but I’m feeling so unwanted by everyone around me. Could you all please message me encouraging words that would make me smile and let me know I’m loved? Call me an attention seeker, you’d be absolutely right, I’d love to wake up to a good morning text or something to know what that’s like. If I’m being honest I’d love to see if people turned heads at my state of mind. I’m off to bed now hopefully I won’t wake up to no messages, as if I don’t already feel rejected enough."
Throwaway99927373626,2021-12-27 01:52:51+00:00,Therapy is making me think I’d be better off just killing myself,"I’ve been in therapy for a while now, probably almost three years. Had 4 therapists in that time. My current one is the first one who really seems to actually *do* anything. The other ones I just kinda talked to and occasionally they’d say “you probably do X because of Y” or something like that. It’s an oversimplification but that’s really what it amounted to. Anyway, my current one is at least giving me actionable advice or sending me home with tests to take to find out more about my issues and stuff which at least feels like *something* is being done.

A few sessions ago she told me that I’m probably not going to be able to make any improvements at all while I’m still living with my toxic mother. But I’ve lived on my own before, twice, and all it lead to was me eventually getting so depressed that I couldn’t work anymore and having to move back here both times. I can see where she’s coming from and I agree that living with my mum is bad for my mental health, but clearly so is moving out. I know share housing is a thing and stuff, but I just can’t do that, I need my space, I couldn’t handle being in such close proximity to people all the time with nowhere to get away. 

And every time I do one of these tests, they usually make me realise I’m more fuck than I even thought. Wasn’t a test, but my last therapist got me to download an app that you’re supposed to use to make a suicide prevention plan for yourself. But when your filling it out, it asks you to put in things like a list of people you can talk to, a friends phone number to call in a crisis, shit like that and I just uninstalled it, made me too fucking depressed to realise I don’t have a single friend at all.

This most recent test I’m pretty sure was for schema therapy, at least that’s what my therapist said. Don’t know if it’s a standard test, if it is maybe some of you have taken it, but it’s Jeffery Young Questionnaire or something like that. Anyway, it’s littered with questions about if you’ve had people care about you before and going through it I made me realise that no, I’ve literally never felt cared about once in my entire life. Although that being said, the first statement you gauge yourself against is “I haven’t had someone to nurture me, share him/herself with me, or care deeply about everything that happens to me”, which I’m not convinced anyone has actually had. Don’t know that people like that even really exists, the first two parts maybe, but someone caring deeply about everything that happens to someone else seems like a stretch. 

Anyway, I guess that’s what I’m gonna be working on for the next however long, schema therapy. It’s just that even my therapist is saying to me right now that with how severe some of my particular issues are and how many there are, it could potentially take decades to get them all stable and also that I’ll likely never be free of them completely. I’ll still always have bouts of severe anhedonia, might just not be all the time like it is now, but I’ll still be so existentially bored some of the time that I don’t want to exist at all. She’s not sure she can help me with my post-coital dysphoria, so I might still never be able to have healthy sexual relationships, even when I’m “better”. I’ll still probably have a tough time connecting with people because of all my attachment trauma.

It just makes me wonder, if the expected outcome here is that I’m still gonna be pretty fucked by the end, and the path to getting the is gonna be hard and take a long fucking time, then why bother? I feel like with the information she’s given me it’s kinda made me realise that it’s probably a genuinely kinder option to myself to save myself the constant suffering and just accept that I was fucked the second I was born to the parents I had. That the game is fucking rigged and the only winning move for me is to not play. I just don’t know why I’d wanna go through all this shit just maybe one day get to a place we’re things suck, but maybe slightly less."

I'm trying to stay positive and I'm trying to work on myself, but damn somedays I just feel like it's not going to get better. I come from a family full of healthcare workers, Tech bros, and lawyers. I'm the black sheep in the family that has no idea what he wants to do in life. I suck at learning and I'm too awkward to connect with professionals. I feel like a child whenever I'm speaking to someone above me.

I'm getting closer to 30 and I just feel like a loser because I haven't done anything with my life. I'm not even sure if I can succeed anymore. People always tell me to either switch majors, learn a trade, or go into the military. Well, I'm terrible at learning. I have a hard time focusing and learning new material. It usually takes me longer to learn and I'm always behind everyone else in class. I'm also pretty clumsy, and I'm not very strong mentally or physically, so learning a trade or joining the military is a no

I feel like I'm never going to make enough money to live on my own; especially because everything is getting so expensive now. I know eventually my family is going to kick me out. I don't have other family members or too many friends to stay with so I'm worried that I'm be homeless in the future."

Looking at social media has been triggering
Seeing everyone I know celebrating 
And here I am, trying not to drown
Keeping my head above the water

The torment never ends
I feel more and more alone each time I ask myself ‘when’s it my turn?’
But it seems like I’m not even on the guest list
I’m not invited to this party called life
I’m just a crasher but instead, I’m the one crashing down

I am taking my meds as prescribed 
I’m making sure my time is spent on anything but idleness
But that cloud hanging over me isn’t going anywhere
It’s devouring me but I’m just too exhausted now to even fight it
Who’s to say I didn’t put up a good fight?
But tonight, I’m throwing in the towel in sweet surrender
Back to the pit again
The bottomless pit that I dread, but also my familiar place

I’m so sorry but tonight I’m letting it take control
Until I’m ready to resurface again
But until then I hope that there is still enough life left in me"

I try to focus on me, I did that for a while, with a few success, but whenever I hear about something new related to her, sometimes accidentally, such as she's seeing someone, or she deletes me from somewhere, or anything, I get some kind of panic attack

right now I'm probably feeling the worst since a while, it's hard to breath, no strength, feeling kind of dizzy, hungry but can't get to eat anything, preparing food is just too hard
I feel hopeless, and I'm 36 already, I wanted to have a family with the woman I wanted, I think I'm going to turn crazy
I would have prefered to live in a world with no rules and states, it would have been so much easier, I feel like all of this isn't natural, all artificial

riverixx,2021-12-26 17:47:15+00:00,A Bad Cycle,"My depression is sort of seasonal, I usually get more sad towards the fall and happier towards the springtime, but that really only applied to me the first two years I’ve had depression. 

For the past three years now, I get into a bad cycle of depression. I can be depressed for weeks, suicidal, crying, and feeling exhausted. I could just be absolutely tired for no reason and crying every night about everything type of depression. But then I feel so happy, I wondered what’s wrong with me previously when I feel so happy in the moment. This can last for months. Especially when I first got depressed, these periods of both depression and happiness were far apart. 

I don’t feel depressed at all during these times, but lately my happy moments are short. I’m happy, but I’m dreading the bad times in these happy moments. It’s like I can’t even enjoy anything anymore, and it sucks. I’m smiling and laughing, but what good is it when I’m going to go back to feeling like shit. 

I’m getting older, and I wonder if life is just passing me by. Maybe it’s because my brain is exhausted or whatever, lol. 

Anyone else have similar cycles to me? Would love to hear I’m not alone on this…haha"

I need to wake up early tomorrow but I can't sleep because I keep thinking about the shit my mom pulled at the family christmas party earlier today. 
She and her bf kept fighting the whole car ride there because we were late. When we got there, she refused to come out of the car so my brother and I went inside while she and her bf talked in the car. Next thing, her bf told me she was missing. He told me that she was acting psychotic and last time she acted that way was when she stopped her medication. So I looked for her in the rain and found her in the party host's (my aunt's) shed. I found her laying there half conscious. I was terrified that she had done something harmful to herself. Yet I was furious. She pulls a scene every christmas and then the whole family has to stop having fun and care for her. I used to feel sorry for her but this time I left her in the shed and told other people to help her. My aunt helped her to the bedroom and asked me to give her water with some calming pill dissolved inside. I literally just told her ""Get up and drink the water. Now."" in a very cold manner. I had no sympathy this time. She ruins christmas every year because of her age-old family issues. 
I didn't speak to her since that. They drove my brother and I home and then left. She stays in a different suburb with her bf. I feel so alone at the moment. I have no one to talk to. I'm the daughter of the black sheep in this family and she puts me through hell. That's why i decided to stay with my brother in this flat. To get away from her."

ZachariahTrench,2021-12-25 11:26:39+00:00,"A sad rant of my life, this holiday season","Family over for holidays, they didn't ask if they could stay over for 2 weeks, they just showed up. They aren't aware of the complete and utter mental exhaustion I'm going through financially and at the complete collapse of a 4yr relationship with a woman I love deeply, but that it's truly time to let go of. The pushing of more and more work on me in a short staffed office. The bills piling up quicker than I can sort out, the 13yr old son of my now ex texting me and begging me to not give up on his mom and to please try, please work through our issues, but I'm done with her, now more than ever before, I can't put up with her immature childish ways anymore. I deserve more, and to put up with it as long as I have shows how little love I've had for myself. With what feels like the complete utter collapse of my life and mental state all around me, my heart shatters even more to break my sons heart, he doesn't deserve this,  but I tried far more than I ever should have.

Cue tonight:

So emotionally drained and tired, Why?

9pm - 
Mom: What do you want to watch Zachariah?

Zachariah: Anything but stand up, please.

9pm-5am -
Proceed to watch absolutely nothing but stand up comedy, holding in pure annoyance and mental fatigue to say ""I literally said anything but standup!!!!""

The world is tearing me down quicker everyday than I can rebuild myself and I've never felt closer to completely worn out, completely entirely drained in my entire life. I'm pretty sure I'm way beyond empty. I don't think anyone does it on purpose it's just hard and the absolute worse time for people to be so blissfully unaware or uncaring. I've never wanted pure solitude more in my entire life, or the company of someone who at least has a fraction of knowledge of who Zachariah actually is, because it's not my mom!!! You all do similar stuff except differently, but Im usually not so worn down and can withstand it from you.

Why?

Not an actual question for you, just a gasp of my few remaining exhausted mental strands, a gasp of pure emotionally drained mental tiredness that I need a break from, can someone just care about my comfort for a change? Can someone care about my mental state?! Can someone allow themselves a little bit of inconvenience to help me, to be there for me?!?! I don't ask for much do I?!? I'm inconvenienced and go out of my way all the time for people, can someone do the same for me?! Can someone come to my apartment and hang out with me for a change, instead of making me drive to them?!? Or make me watch what they want to watch?!? Or do what they want to do?!? Or be who they want me to be?!?

The only explanation that I usually come up with is that I'm your friends, but you're not mine, or maybe I care differently than other people do, or maybe I just see it differently. I am different, that's a fact .... but how can people act how they act, be as blind as they are, be what I can only call .... so uncaring, only bothering when it's simple for them, when it's convenient for them.

If I wasn't literally surrounded by family in my own apartment for the last 168hrs I would have already cried for multiple hours to just let out a portion of my emotions, cry and cry and cry and cry until I can't anymore, or maybe until I don't want to anymore.

But thats not the Zachariah I ever allow the world to see. I'll just do what I do, push my emotions down and keep portraying my stoic Zachariah demeanor, remain ""Zachariah"" as the days continue to wear me down further than I ever thought possible, more mentally tired every minute I need to keep my mask up, and it HAS to stay up EVERY minute because I have no moments of alone time, no moments of down time, no moments that someone isn't calling or texting or making me drive here or there or volunteering me to take your dog out to poop as I'm literally sleeping at 8am!!! I don't think I hate people but sometimes I really hate people, the people that don't have a shred of awareness, a shred of compassion, but that's everyone. Usually they're not even aware and I don't care to inform them, to exert the effort to explain to them my weakened tired mental state. Can I be mad at them for that? Can I be sad at them for that? Can I tell someone just leave me alone please, without being an asshole?!? Can I try to have your company, your much needed company without being called negative or judgy or critical, maybe I am those things at this moment or maybe it's a sign of something deeper going on and you shouldn't throw it in my face, you shouldn't push me further away, maybe pull me in closer, maybe give me a few more minutes, maybe hug me tight and don't let go even when I say I don't want a hug. 

Everything, all of it, it all affects my mental state, it all weighs me down, one pound added to my rucksack every day. My ruck sack is beyond full and has been for longer than I can remember, but I can handle one more pound, right Zachariah? More weight added every single day, until when? When my back is broken? When I'm laying on the ground and crawling through my life and someone finally says, ""You need help, can I help you??"" ""I'm sorry, but get the fuck away from me, you weren't there when I could have used it, I'll damn sure continue my suffering alone rather than give you the satisfaction of ""helping"" me, not a day late but a month late, a year late, with all due respect just walk away and leave me alone, continue your life and feel good that you offered help"" I don't feel good about it, I feel insulted. Where were you when I needed you? Why didn't I ask for help sooner? I didn't think I needed it but you, you saw all the signs but chose to ignore them, chose to believe I was strong enough to keep carrying the weight of the world alone for another day, another week, another month. Just leave me alone. I'll pull myself out as I always do, but I won't look at you same, I'll know that you won't be there for me and I'll be stronger and more capable and a little bit more alone tomorrow .... for better or worse.


I'm not suicidal Friend, don't worry, and this text isn't directed towards you, just something I wish I could scream to the world and for them to hear me and see my mental and emotional exhaustion, not for them to run to me and help me, but just for the world to know they left me behind, they didn't pick me up, and I noticed. I only send this to you Reddit because I can't send it to anyone else. 

This is a brief glimpse of Zachariah's extremely tired exhausted beaten down mental state and I apologize for sending it at this time on this day. Dont worry though, I'm putting my mask back on now ........... and ""Zachariah"" has reported to life, as happy as he can be .... in this day."

Negative self talk until you're sad,feel like a poser don't want to show up?","I've been pretty depressed. Even when I'm not depressed and am feeling somewhat confident or normal. I'll have an event or party to go to. Instead of shaking off the jitters like a normal person. I find me tearing myself apart. To the point that I feel so bad/insecure about my appearance or conversation that I end up talking myself out of going. Sometimes I even make myself cry. I don't know what's wrong with me. 

My aunt had a Christmas party planned months ago. I was excited about going. I had an outfit than my fractured mind struck and I ended up not going. I just convinced myself no one wanted to be around my negative boring vibe or awkward energy. They're so put together and I am not. They have stuff going on in life, I can't see anything through,why would they even want to be around me? I suck.
 I picked my mom/kid up from the party I went too early they weren't ready so I left(to come back later) my cousin called me 3x trying to see me. When I came back later to help with bags I said hi and got a cold shoulder.

 Now I'm worried about my aunt&amp;cousin(not real family my moms childhood friend) being mad at me. When will this self loathing ever end?!? I'm supposed to be a confident decided person. Going outside my comfort zone. But everything is an anxiety spiral!. :'( 
Should I care that my mom didn't ask me why or what's going on with me? Sometimes I feel alone like no one cares about me&amp; it hurts so deeply. But when I'm offered togetherness I refuse it.."

Like I'm never going to be able to do things right compared to everyone else, and I should just prematurely leave me life because of it. I can't compare to other people. I'm just a mess and I'm too depressed to learn to do things right. I wish I was as smart as everyone else, and able to learn things as well as everyone else. I'm just stupid stupid stupid"

I have depressive episodes now and then. And when it happens, my wife gets really upset and nervous. She speaks to me harshly, as if I am being punished for being mentally ill.

I understand that I make her life worse and she has to deal with it, though it is not her fault at all. How else can I help her?

After all, it is only a confirmation that I do everything wrong and that I am nothing but a burden. I should steer clear from her life."

I don’t want to have the life I have, and my life isn’t even bad. I just wish I had a life where I didn’t feel so hopelessly lost in the direction I was going in. I cry a lot at night because of how lonely I am. Everyone says I should learn to be happy with myself before I get into a relationship but I don’t know how to do that when I tie my self worth to how attractive I am to other people. I just try to remind myself that no one will love me often, I think that way it’ll eventually hurt less once I get so old it’s truly hopeless for it to ever happen. I want to die but I’m afraid of reincarnation being real and I end up with an even worse situation. I just don’t know if I’ll ever be truly happy but pretending I am to my friends and family is getting really tiresome."

Throwaway99927373626,2021-12-25 04:35:09+00:00,"Finally made an effort to meet people again, got fucking catfished.","Don’t know why I fucking bothered at all. Don’t know how many times I’m gonna have to learn the same fucking lesson. I. HATE. PEOPLE. Always have. But I keep fucking forgetting, apparently. 

Struggle to connect to anyone. Only ever had one person I’d consider a friend and I don’t even talk to her anymore cause apparently my brain mistakes human decency and the smallest display of respect for romance and also skips straight past a crush, straight past love and all the way to venomous obsession. Has a way of ruining a friendship, I guess. Also has a way of ruining a persons desire to ever make another friend again. 

But apparently no one told my fucking brain any of that, cause it still craves that’s connection, that’s intimacy that it knows it can’t have. That most of my brain doesn’t even fucking *want*. Doesn’t matter how many times I have to endure being stuck in conversations with “friends” while I’m dissociating cause of how disconnected I feel from them, or how many times I’ve been dumb enough to get stuck at a party or a bar with a group of people who’s faces I can’t even recall when they’re sitting across from me just because I feel like I need to *force* myself to try having friends I clearly can’t have. 

Anyway, guess cause I’m still biologically a 22 year old male, I still have a sex drive and also because I begrudgingly have to accept I’m also human, I guess I still need intimacy. And since I have exactly zero friends or people in my life period, I resorted to Tinder. Started talking to a girl, eventually started to actually feel somewhat comfortable with her, I guess. I’ve got C-PTSD, and I dunno, she started to pull my into feeling some remnant of “safe” in our conversations. Started to consider it might actually lead to us meeting at some point so I forced myself to talk to her about the self-harm scars all over my body since I thought better she hear it before we meet. 

Anyway, thanks to the title, you probably already know how this goes so I’ll spare the fucking details. I got fucking catfished. Not a fucking shred of that person was real. Don’t know why the fuck I didn’t see it coming. Figures the one fucking time in years I let my guard down, I get immediately fucking punished for it. Guess that’s what I fucking get for not fucking learning ever. This whole species is fucked. 

To add salt in the wounds, that old friend of mine, one I was obsessed with, apparently finally decided this was the first Christmas since we met that she isn’t going to send me a text. It’s for the best, know I’ve gotta move on from her, I do know that. But I guess given everything it just feels like a final gut punch after barely surviving a cage fight with a fucking silverback gorilla hopped up on amphetamines. Just drives home I guess that I miss how things used to be with her, before I poisoned it with the black fucking tar that runs through my veins and corrupts everything fucking touch. 

Anyway, maybe this time I’ll learn my fucking lesson. Maybe I should carve it into my fucking skin to remind me. At this point all I wanna do is somehow save enough money to move as far as fucking possible away from people, say fuck you to the whole world and spend my days drinking myself into and early fucking grave."

depressed_dummy,2021-12-25 02:08:48+00:00,Ghosted for being transparent,"I recently learned that I had transmitted cold sores to the girl I was talking to. I really liked her and we were going really well over the past few months. We had our ups and downs, but we always talked about our future. When she told me that she had oral herpes, I realized that it was probably me that gave it to her. My whole family has a history of cold sores, and as far back as I remember, I've had one. For me, it's nothing to worry about, but it was something she had not expected. She got really upset with me for not telling her that I had ""oral herpes"" beforehand. I didn't think cold sores could transmit without an actual cold sore, and I had assumed that it was normal to have a cold sore simply because I've had it since birth.

When she revealed that she had ""oral herpes,"" I sort of freaked out because I realized that I had given it to her and I also realized that I had forgotten to mention to her that I had a history of cold sores. She is a very calm girl, but she suddenly lashed out at me. Before revealing the diagnosis, she had said that she was worried that I was going to think that she was ""nasty and dirty."" Now, she was attacking me for not sharing the information with her, calling me ""uneducated and unaware."" I was hurt, but I thought that she had every right to feel that way. I didn't really care because I genuinely believed that I had some fault in the issue. I apologized over and over again. 

Fast forward 1 week, I have been completely ghosted by her. I don't know if she has my number blocked or just ignoring me, or just taking time for herself, but I have not received any contact over the past week. We're now in winter break and we're separated by several hundred miles. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I still want to be with her, which is the opposite of what everyone else had suggested. I know that she has a history of shutting in when things become overwhelming or when she is physically separated from her partner. She had mentioned that she wants to get over that habit, so I don't want to just stop communicating with her. But I don't know if she blocked me or not, and I just don't know what's going on because she hasn't been communicating with me. 

I'm just scared that she hates me now, and I just feel confused and lost because I was being simply transparent with her. I could have lied and said I never had cold sores before, but we had agreed to be honest and respect each other. Yet this is what I end up with, and I just do not know how to proceed. I told her that I still want to stay in touch with her and that we can talk again when she's ready. The options I have are to 1) dump her and move on, 2) text her intermittently over break, or 3) stop contacting her and reconnect come Spring semester. I want to go with option 2 or 3. I fucking hate myself for it, but I just love the hell out of her, and unless she confronts me about it, I'm unwilling to give up. I would really appreciate some advice. Thanks."

Rackintosh,2021-12-24 19:43:06+00:00,Not all creatures in this world are meant to survive...,"Not all creatures in this world are meant to survive, let alone thrive. Not all of us are meant to mean something, find our ""purpose"", be special or -actually- interesting, find love, make an impact, or get dignified deaths. Not all of us are meant to be ""found"" nor have closure. Life just... isn't that way. 

Life, in fact, isn't what you make it and very few people find that out, let alone are able to give credence to. Life isn't beautiful because you make it so, or from some ""change of perspective"". It can be horrifying, gross, cruel, exhausting, and almost infinitely complex. Happiness is not a choice. Biology along with luck, circumstances, traumatic history, timing, and maybe even a little bit of that potential, 4th-dimensional higher power factor, all play a huge role—a -substantial- one. 

For there to be useful people, there has to be useless people as well—and some of us don't find our roles (let alone fulfilling ones) nor what we're ""good at"" or ""meant to do"" in this life. Not everyone's purpose is to stay alive—some of us have to die early. That includes suicide.

txactor13,2021-12-24 02:23:54+00:00,I need to change,"Yesterday I went out with friends as I usually do every Wednesday night. This week I went a little overboard though and ended up blacking out west conference that my car was stolen.  After mildly freaking out in my own head and trying to figure things out and I reached out to my family and let them know what’s going on and they were worried. 

Turns out the car wasn’t stolen I just ended up blacking out and forgot where I parked so now my mom was in a panic and my family asked her what was going on so she let my aunts and uncles know what was going on .

No the truth is coming out but what really happened my mom is extremely disappointed and upset with me and of course it happens to be right around Christmas

I just feel like I’m the actual fuck up on the family and everything that’s bad happens to me or a closet and I’m sick and tired of being in feeling like the failure of the family. I know that it sucks but sometimes I feel like they would be better off if I actually wasn’t around that’s a stupid thing to think about during Christmas but it’s how I feel

I just know that I need to change now but I feel like I’ve done too much damage to where it’s not gonna make a difference in my family and they’re just all gonna think that I’m still a screwup that I’ve always been I just don’t know what to do.  It’s safe to say I’m scared to see my family this weekend"

I push others away. I am deeply hurt and I can not get past trauma in my life to make any real progress towards fixing anything. It has surfaced as anger, I am just so damn angry all the time. Despite putting on a happy face and going through my day, deep down I am so fucking angry and just tired. I want to give up, I want to die. I truly believe those in my life are miserable because of me and would live much happier lives if I just wasnt around. I am ruining my kids, they are like sponges and just soak up all the bad that escapes my tight grip. I try, I try so fucking hard to hold it all in. And I do hold a lot of it in, but some escapes and I just am tired. 

This longing for death never goes away. Since I was 12 years old my thoughts would drift off to being dead and how I truly want it, I just dont want to hurt anyone by my actions. They would be better off without me if I died suddenly in some accident, they would not have any added pain. If I killed myself they could question themselves if there was a way to stop me, and I dont want them be contemplating whys. I just want to die without it being my fault. I am always to blame for everything else. 

I do not know what to do anymore, ive truly tried but it does not go away. These thoughts of me being the bad, the plague that infects all the good and spoils it and I am just too tired of trying yet do not know how to not try..."

I'm thankful for everything I have and I'm really proud of myself but jeez is this hard. I break down all the time but I keep going. I was in the military and took custody of my brother and sister when I as 18 so keeping one foot in front of the other is all I know. I haven't really made friends where I am now ( its very country and spread out here in North Mississippi). I just wish I had someone to share the holidays with. I'm not even sad about the gifts although just knowing someone cared enough to give me one would make me so happy id probably cry.

VeryMentallyStable,2021-12-23 16:14:22+00:00,"I’ve never felt more touch starved, and yet I can’t think of anything worse than being touched","Can feel my skin tightening up as I type this out. Can’t remember the last time someone even touched me at all. I don’t have anyone in my life at all, no friends, no family, definitely no girlfriend. Guess I’ve never been the type for any of that. Been unemployed for the past couple months so I don’t even have co-workers or acquaintances. Thing is, I prefer it like this. The touch starvation is awful, but the bullshit that comes with having people in your life is much worse. 

I just wish my fucking brain would get the memo, I don’t like people. Me and people don’t mix. So it’s infuriating to me that my body gets this hunger, this intense need to feel someone’s skin on mine. Feels like being born allergic to water or something. 

Part of me wants sex, bigger part of me knows better. I’m actually terrified of sex at this point. Can’t connect with people and I guess I need to feel that with someone before hand, because I’ve never been able to orgasm during sex in my entire life. Basically given up by now. Only so many times I can have that conversation with someone. Guess as a guy, you’re expected to orgasm every single time, so when you don’t it’s impossible to explain it without your partner feeling like they’ve done something wrong or they’re not good enough. Plus I just feel broken. So I dread the thought of sex ever coming up somehow.

But I think the thing I crave more than anything is to just hold someone. Keep picturing having someone next to me in bed at night. Feeling her warmth. Feeling her soft skin against mine. The scent of her hair. The way her smaller body slots together perfectly with my own taller frame as we spoon. Hearing her soft breaths cut through the deafening silence that’s always here. The feeling of knowing someone actually *wants* to be in my arms. Even hug a fucking pillow while I sleep cause it’s something. 

But I can’t have any of that. I’ve only ever met one person I’d even considered doing any of that with and she didn’t feel the same. And besides, in hindsight what I felt for her wasn’t love, it was something much uglier; obsession. I tend to poison any semblance of beauty when it enters my life. Think it’s just tar that runs through my veins. Not to mention she proved to be just as disappointing as everyone else in the end. So I can’t form connections and the thought of doing any of this with someone I feel nothing for is enough to make me want to kill myself. 

Therapy, medication, none of it seems to be able to help me form those connections so I guess these are just needs I’ll never be able to satisfy. Can’t even go get a fucking massage cause I don’t like the thought of strangers touching me while I can’t see them and also I’m almost entirely covered in deep self-harm scars I never want anyone to see. I know they don’t judge or at least would never mention it or whatever, but I know that just feeling eyes on those scars would tense me up so much that any benefit of going in the first place would be null and void. Guess I’ll just have to live with this hunger forever."

VeryMentallyStable,2021-12-23 12:43:21+00:00,Can’t think of a single reason to be here,"I don’t get how anyone else does it. How can anyone be content to be here? How do people not just hit a certain age where they just kinda realise this is all there is and that it’s fucking boring? You just do the same shit basically every day, just fill in time each day over and over again until one day, if you’re lucky, you die of old age. There’s no substance to any of it. None of it matters. Nothing feels worth doing to me. 

I’ve tried to find some kind of enjoyment or just something in anything, I really have. It’s not like I *want* to feel like everything anyone does on this planet is worthless. But I guess I can’t force myself to care and I really just can’t see the point of any of it. There’s people who find meaning in their work, but I don’t have any career goals, there’s no job I’m ever going to care about more than just to pay my rent. Which that alone feels like enough reason to off myself, because you spend a majority of your time on the planet at work and so if you know you’re not the type of person who’s ever going to care about it, that means most of your time here might as well not happen.

I’ve tried finding hobbies I enjoy, but I just can’t. It’s like something is missing in me. Best I can hope for is that I can get a day or two of distraction before I realise how bored I am again and put down the hobby because I don’t see the point anymore. Tried getting outside, travelling, but it’s pointless too. Everywhere just feels the same to me. Basically just me being suicidally depressed but with a different background. 

Tried finding a point in people, but fuck are we just a disappointing species. I can’t connect with anyone. Most people are just fucking worthless. Only ever met one person who I even remotely *wanted* to hang out with and she turned out to be just as shitty as the rest of them, just took her sweet fucking time to show it. Even worse because apparently part of my brain didn’t get the memo and so I still have this inbuilt need for connection or even just for sex, but I literally can’t fulfil either of them. Feels like being born allergic to water or something. I know I can’t have any real connection with anyone, but apparently I need to in order to have sex. I’ve tried so many times  without it and it’s just awful. It makes me feel weirdly sick and I literally can’t orgasm. I’ve never once been able to orgasm during sex. Guess it’s just one more way in broken. The only time I’ve ever experienced any kind of sexual satisfaction has been in dreams, and in those it’s usually with that one old friend who I actively try to keep out of my head so even whatever small comfort those dreams might’ve brought is corrupted.

Only conclusion I can reach is that I just don’t fucking belong here. Clearly I’m missing some critical pieces that I need to be able to feel like living another 50+ years of this shit is anything but awful. But yet I’m still here because I guess even killing myself is more energy than I have left to expend. I just wish someone would fucking shoot me in the head or run me over or something."
Rude_Hovercraft_5940,2021-12-23 09:55:14+00:00,Feeling depressed after a year of a lot of dates that went no where,"I feel at the end of myself right now. It's not the first time I've felt this way this year, but I think it's worse because of recent dates and because it's the end of the year. 

I started online dating about 5months ago. Ive had about 12 first dates and a couple 2nd dates. 

Last couple of dates have been tough on me. Woman seemed really interested in me, but showed up to our 2nd date and dumped a bunch of stuff on me including how sad she was that she had to break it off with another guy. That fizzled out after a couple weeks. 

Then had a date the other week that felt great, but she ghosted me for 48hr and then told me she didn't feel a connection. 

Then I had a date this past Sunday that went very well, but last text was a bit awkward. We do have a 2nd date scheduled.

At this point I have lost confidence in this going anywhere because of past experiences. I can't help but feel like I'll mess it up or that something will happen. 

I feel self defeated

I felt confident earlier on, but it's kind of chipped away and now I am not sure what to do. 

I'm feeling depressed and struggling to see the point. I felt like I had a shot with the women I meet Sunday but all those negative voices are killing me. The anxiety is bad.

I like to think I'm a confident person, but dating has eroded that overtime I think."

ErisWoodenWing,2021-12-23 07:11:43+00:00,It Hurts to be Forgotten on your Birthday,"
I just turned 18, yay. 🎉 a pivotal age and huge milestone. I thought I had found a friend that cared about me for once, we've been friends for nearing 8yrs now and recently our friend group expanded when they got a SO and merged our groups together I though I'd finally found my people those that understand how hard it is to get out of bed in the morning and force yourself to get through the day without just ending it all. 

And yet. Not a single one of them contacted me all of today, I've been awake 24hrs excited for the day ahead for once. But I heard nothing. I kept checking my phone to see if anyone had messaged or called even once but no. Not a single message, at this point I wouldn't even care what kind of message, it didn't have to be birthday wishes I would have been fine with the very least an acknowledgement that I existed, and it's not like they didn't know. I literally in person face to face said to the whole group ""I am turning 18 in 3 hours isn't that crazy?"" Yet nothing.

 Its been so hard just living this long, I don't know how much longer I can last. All I want is for someone to care about me. I never had friends when I was a kid, at least not real ones ( I didn't realize until I was older that those I thought of as friends didn't consider me one, nor would they ever willingly give me the light of day) I put so much effort into trying to strengthen my relationships with others and yet all I get back is nothing but broken trust and a fractured heart. 

All I've ever wanted was to have someone care about me and have initiative. I've always been the one reaching out first and trying my best to connect with others no matter how hard it gets because that's what was always ingrained in my brain, but no one ever does anything for me first. They always say do what you want others to do to you. All I want is a friend but it seems like I'm not even worth one. The cuts on my hips only get larger by the day and I don't know how much longer I can go before they break me. They say that 18 is a milestone. Well, I doubt I'll reach 20."

Every time I plan to do something to break out of my loneliness or to break out of this hole, the devil pulls me right back in. I see so many people my age doing so much to advance in the real world. Yet, I'm stuck in the same position for the past five years.

It feels unreal. It feels unsecured. And I'm uncomfortable.

I don't know what's next. But for now, all I do is keep a smile on my face so that no one else around me can see my crying for help.

I've reached out to counselors for help. Unfortunately, during the pandemic, many of their offices were either closed or not accepting any new patients. 

I need your advice. What am I to do next? 

I've been exploring church to see if that could help push me forward. But I think I need moral support, human interactions, and someone to mentor me to move forward in life. I can do it alone at age 28. But I've reached a dead end and I need re-routing.

I somehow managed to pass my school with lowest marks possible but obviously no college in my city would give me a seat. My father did his best to find a proper college and eventually he did by speaking (pleading) to some influencial people for admission in a decent college.

The next 3 years I would go on and try to get a degree in commerce (finance) but I FAILED MISERABLY. During that time period I met my childhood friend who becomes my girlfriend.

Later I would try to find a job but I would get worst jobs because I don't have a college degree.
Now I'm 23 years old my parents do not know that I don't have a degree nither do my friends or my girlfriend.

My gf goes on to pursue charted accountant (CA)
Meanwhile I work at a customer support for a smartphone company which sucks my soul. I'm depressed I'm scared 
I'm scared that my girlfriend would leave me if I tell her the truth I don't have a degree and I work at bad place.
I'm scared that my friends would make fun of me if I tell the truth.
I'm scared that my parents would hate me for life for wasting there money and disappointing them.

For the past 3 years every single day I wake up my first thought is that I hate myself for being a failure.
My family is in a financial crises now &amp; I'm helpless
This depression has changed me so much that my gf is slowly loosing interest in me.  I love her so much but am scared to confess the situation I'm in.
I hate my life decisions . I was immature for not putting in the efforts.

My mother had told me around that time that she never wanted me, regretted having me, and one of the reasons she couldn't want me was because I never shut up.  She always let me know she didn't like me.  I began wondering if anyone would miss me if I died.  I still wonder who would.  I know my son would, but would anyone else miss me?

Prehistoric_Lama,2021-12-22 01:34:48+00:00,I’m dead on the inside.,"Title sums it honestly, I’ve never felt alive, except when I was a toddler, which was, and I know this sounds weird, the best and only good period of my life, although even then I wasn’t feeling that well, but there was a lot of happy moments that helped overcome my demons back then.

Unfortunately, as I grew older, the happy moments became less and less frequent, gradually disappearing until becoming nonexistent, as early as primary school when I already started struggling, it only got worse as I became older.

Now I’m in college, and I’ve never felt this disconnected from reality and the outside world, I have no friends, no one cares about me or my well-being, no one reaches out to me and nobody wants to befriend me no matter how hard I try to, I’m not a bad person, I’m a genuinely kind, caring and attentive dude, I’m always respectful to others and never cross boundaries, yet they flee me like some kind of leper.

Everyday I see people in their groups having fun, others dating or being successful with girls no matter how objectively stupid what they say or do might be, and I’m there standing alone in a corner crying and tearing my heart out where no one is able to see me, I’ve tried everything I could but no one ever cared, it’s hard to realise and accept that you don’t mean anything to anyone, that you’re like an invisible ghost to others.

I feel incredibly lonely, and at the same time don’t feel like talking to anyone, you could say that I’m a spectator or a non playable character in the background attending other people’s lives without having any sort of impact on it.

Suicide is always on my mind, I don’t see a point in living as my life can be described as emptiness and numbness, I don’t have any purpose and I’m not having any will to live, I want to end it so badly but I’m not able to because it’s not something that we do in my culture, without forgetting the impact that it could have on my parents, ‘cause I know that they’ll be the only people that’ll care or just notice my absence, especially my mother, but at the same time this pain and agony has been eating me from the inside and there’s always that thought in my head, repeating over and over again that the only way to stop getting hurt is maybe to stop living entirely.

I don’t know if I’ll do it, and I don’t know when, the only thing I’m sure about is that if I’m finally able to gather some courage and actually pull the trigger, it’ll only be the death of my body, because in my mind I’ve dead for a long time and no one will ever notice that I’m not there anymore.

Please pardon me if I made any kind of error or typo as English isn’t my primary language, thanks to anyone who read the whole thing, I know it’s a long post and I’m sorry about it."
No_Understanding8816,2021-12-22 01:01:57+00:00,Lost my voice / myself,"I had my voice done about two years ago. I was so obsessed with having a high pitch voice men would love to hear. I ended up getting it done 3 times because each type my voice did the opposite effect it got deeper and the more I had surgery I lost my accent and my power to make people laugh. I now no longer know how I sound every time I make a joke there's silence when it used to be laughter from people I loved to entertain. I no longer have that voice it's deeper, strained, low &amp; more serious. I'm also really into zodiac signs and I no longer get along with some of the zodiac signs I used to love they no longer find me intriguing or funny it interesting. Nobody calls my name during conversations nobody thinks back at what I said I am no longer my natural funny perfectly imperfect self. I urge nobody to get surgery on your voice it's not worth it and you lose yourself your voice is who you are! I have to go through life like this but it's fine I did it to myself but I urge please don't get surgery on your voice it holds so much power.... Your voice is perfectly imperfect"

VeryMentallyStable,2021-12-21 15:32:27+00:00,Keep having sexual dreams about a girl and it makes me feel like a creep,"I know I’ve already made a few posts about some of this stuff already, might’ve seen them here over the past couple days so I’m sorry if this is getting spammy, but I just can’t stop thinking about it. 

There was this girl I used to know. Only friend I’ve ever had. Never felt any kind of connection with another person before her at all, didn’t think I was capable of it to be honest. But with her I guess things just kinda lined up just right. Met her at my second job, bartending in a small town pub. Thought she hated me at first, she’s the type of person who seems to hate everyone. Always been my favourite type of people, even in games with romance options, I’ve always gravitated toward the cold, harsh women like Yennefer from the Witcher or Morrigan from Dragon Age.

I guess over time she warmed up to me. No idea why, guess I just made a couple jokes she found funny. She started texting me outside of work. Started wanting to hang out. Used to tell me she’d get excited when we were rostered on together. One night we went clubbing and I got high on MDMA and accidentally let slip a bunch of traumatic shit from my past. Fully expected things to be weird after that, but she still stuck around. She even started doing random nice things outta the blue afterwards. Like randomly drunk texting me when she was out with friends, tell me how I was one of the coolest, funniest people she knew and that she loved me (as a friend) and I deserved to know that because she couldn’t say it when she was sober. Never been told stuff like that before in my life, especially not unprompted like that.

Then of fucking course, I had to go and start having feelings for her. Felt like a corruption that just tainted the whole thing. Suddenly being around my only friend was fucking painful because I wanted more and I knew she didn’t. Between that and other life things, I was just fucking spiralling down, losing my mind. Started drinking a lot, cutting myself pretty badly, even had a suicide attempt that put me in hospital. And of course she was the only person who came to see me in there, not even my own mother did. She even told me to stay in her guest room for a couple days after I got out so I could relax. Was the nicest torture I’ve ever felt.

Eventually I got so blackout drunk I ended up in the hospital (again) and during the blackout I guess I told her over text how I felt. Don’t remember exactly what I said, but I remember enough to know it was totally pathetic. Riddled with self-depreciation. She took a couple days to tell me she didn’t feel that way about me and I quit the job after that. Saw her one more time when she drove me to a therapy appointment, but never again in person after that. That was two years ago. She’d send me the occasional text, I guess to check if I’d killed myself or something, but even those dried up about 7 months ago. 

Thing is, I still think about her all the fucking time. Tried moving away, had multiple jobs since, lost my virginity since, been with several other girls but they all just left me feeling sick, to this day I’ve literally never been able to orgasm during sex. Actively avoid sex now. Just can’t get her out of my head, no matter how much I try to move on. She shows up in my dreams at least once a week. Most of the time it’s me being angry at her for letting the friendship die, even though I know it was the best thing for us both. But sometimes it’s different.

Couple nights ago I had my least favourite type of dream about her. Or most bittersweet, I guess. I dreamt that she reached out to me. We met up and she told me she had feelings for me but wasn’t ready to tell me before. We swam in a pool together and it lead to us kissing. Then put my hand on her upper back and pulled her chest to my lips, so I could kiss her down the length of it, from her neck to her belly button. Felt so real. Can remember feeling the contrast of frigid beads of water clinging to her warm skin. Feeling the subtle goosebumps dotting her body. Tasting the hint of chlorine in every kiss, hearing her sharp breathing. She *wanted* me. And I actually wanted her. Only time in my miserable fucking life I actually felt some satisfaction from a sexual encounter. But it’s not even fucking real.

Woke up after that and feel the usual flood of emotions. Depressed because it always feels like losing her all over again. Conflicted because I know I don’t really want it to come true considering I know how much of a disaster a relationship between us would be for us both. And then this underlying feeling of just being a fucking creep. How would she feel if she knew I’d thought about her that way? How creeped out would she be if she knew how much I still think about her? I don’t think I could look her in the eye again. But I can’t help it, it’s in my dreams, I can’t stop it. But it’s fucked up, I *know* she doesn’t want me having fantasy sex with her. It feels like such a violation even though I know I’m not doing anything. 

I just hate feeling like that and I wish I could just delete all memory of her from my brain.

TL;DR - I fell in love with my best friend, she didn’t feel the same way and even though we don’t talk anymore, I feel like a fucking creep for still thinking about her all the time and having sex dreams about her that I know she’d be creeped out by if she knew I was having them."

_lonelylover,2021-12-21 11:29:13+00:00,Insecure,"Feeling insecure


Going through a divorce and I feel completely lost and insecure. 

I feel insecure about everything about me. My body, my voice, my hair, my intellect. Everything. And I feel like everyone is expecting me to just bounce back and be ok. I’m not ok. I don’t know when I’ll be ok but I’m not. 

I just feel so undesirable right now. I can’t help but notice the small start of graying hair around my temples, the worry lines forming on my forehead. Or even the teeth that are slightly crooked. It all glaringly stands out to me every time I look in the mirror, every time I take a selfie. Don’t forget a filter since you look like shit without one. My hair is this puffy mess, it looks like I don’t know how to fix it. I do. I just don’t feel like it right now, I can’t do anything. Or my voice, my voice is low and cracks and sounds like a man. I wish i had a cute feminine voice but I don’t. I have this low voice. It’s embarrassing. I can’t help but notice my boobs slowly getting saggier, or my stomach. 

My stomach. 

It’s never been the same since kids and you never let me forget that. You always said I’d have a flat stomach if I would just work out but my body isn’t built like that. Remember when you told a stranger how my stomach looked? Remember when you described the stretch marks and how it sags? Why would you do that to me, except to embarrass me? You always tried to put me down in front of people and I was too clueless to notice it. I had such a hard time picking up on subtleties, and it’s taken me so long to do that. Only because my mom basically ignored me expect for light disdain. So when I finally got attention from you, I was desperate. Rabid for attention. But it was all wrong. And you used that against me. No one cared about me back then. I know I can be hard to love. People barely care about me now."

foreverbrokeaf,2021-12-21 07:58:15+00:00,Driving around to see Christmas lights,"My parents invited me to go drive around the neighborhood to see Christmas lights. I just have so much anger and resentment towards them for acting as if they’re not the main causes of my depression and anxiety and that our previous fight a few days ago never happened. A part of me feels guilty for saying no because I want to make them happy, and that they’re getting older now and they could die anytime. It breaks my heart because I’m hurting and a part of me still wants to fulfill the obligation of being a good daughter. Intrusive thoughts of wanting to hurt myself always come up because I feel terrible for letting people down so I’ve always felt like I don’t deserve to be happy and content. I see other families doing the same thing, driving around the neighborhood looking at Christmas lights and enjoying each other’s presence. It’s getting harder for me to pretend that I enjoy my parents’ company and I’m jealous of some of my friends that have a good relationship with their parents. I know it’s just Christmas lights I’m being depressed over which is fucking simple but my love language is quality time and lately, I haven’t given that to my parents."

I sat through 45 minutes of being told that she’s doing more for me than her parents did for her so i should be grateful and I should “just stop being depressed”. I’m feeling very validated, because my mom is a manipulative unstable control freak, and now someone actually believes that I’m not just like every other teen complaining about their parent. I can’t even be mad about it because it’s not even on purpose, otherwise I doubt all that would come out in a 45 minute session. The week after, i cut myself twice and almost killed myself on 3 separate occasions. I can’t figure out what exactly made me react that way. Spoke to my doc, who agreed that healthiest situation would be to get out of the house, but I’m under 18 and the main problem is that my mom is unstable and there is a high chance that she will harm or kill herself. I don’t know if I have enough self left anymore to care what happens to her.…"
throwawayRS122,2021-12-21 02:38:18+00:00,The two things that helped me most,"TL;DR 1 Realising others may care as much about me as I do about them.
2 Just talking to someone who was willing to listen.

I'm currently not depressed anymore and I just wanted to share two things that really helped me. 
Note: Everyone is different and our situations are different, this may or may not help you but I sure hope it does.

First thing was just a simple thought. 
What if other people cared about me as much as I do about them? Seems kinda simple and maybe dumb but that thought really got to me and the more I thought about it the more it made sense, When was the last time I'd let those who mean the most to me know how much I care about them? And this didn't cure the depression right away but it essentially eliminated the suicidal thoughts immediately.

The second thing happened after I broke my leg.
When I broke my leg I became pretty isolated and I could do very little so I started feeling pretty worthless. I can tell you right now that if more people talked to me and visted me it would've helped a lot, but that didn't happen. I only mention this to say please visit those you know who are sick or injured, they're probably bored and lonely and visiting with you even for an hour or two would most likely be the highlight of their day. 

Anyway, I just hung in there thinking I would feel better once I was back to normal. I got mostly back to normal but I still felt horrible. it took me awhile to even figure out what I was feeling. I was still feeling worthless even after getting back to normal because I felt like no one cared about me, even remembering the aforementioned thought didn't help because all I could think about is the things that people had said or done that made me feel that way.
After weeks of being miserable I finally decided I would talk to my girlfriend about it. I told her about how I felt and why I felt that way. She said very little and was visibly uncomfortable but she listened. Once I was finished talking I changed the subject and we moved on with our day. And that was it, I instantly felt better. 

I waited a few days before Telling my Girlfriend I was feeling better to make sure it wasn't a false alarm and I've never heard such joy in someones voice over the phone before, she sounded genuinely happy I was feeling better. I imagine she was worrying about me possibly wondering what she should say to me. But I didn't need anything but her ear appearantly."
smith_and_jones4ever,2021-12-21 00:50:06+00:00,Being present for a minute made me depressed af,"I was sitting in the living room with the dog and the Christmas tree contemplating the stillness of the moment. There was the old clock on the wall ticking loudly, warm orange light emanating from several sources in the room, the VHS collection on the book shelf, the dog enjoying being petted because she is unaware of death and the fact that it was all in my parents' house made everything seem so temporary. The Christmas tree especially being this delicate, ornate beacon of a fading tradition of kindness. The dog that will eventually die but loves to be alive at the moment. The absence of my parents that is generally welcomed until it is absolute. And being away from all of the entertaining distractions I have become accustomed to made it all more real than most of the moments I notice in the disappointing blur that will be my life time. It was all very depressing while I was steeping in the peaceful agony, trying to ignore the impulse to go to the computer or check my phone for social media notifications. If there was any meaning to this experience it would be that this time period for us humans is not ideal but it's not without some semblance of rationality. It's kind of a good start but there is a lot of idiotic self destruction that needs to stop so humans can develop a real foundation for the society it needs to create in order to last beyond this planet. Yet there are so many inexplicable and terrible decisions made through out the past, present and probable future of mankind. It's depressing af and I wonder if my life will be fucked up by all of the dumb shit that happens and is going to happen for an indeterminate amount of time."
VeryMentallyStable,2021-12-21 00:27:59+00:00,My mental state has murdered my sex life completely,"It’s probably not the biggest issue I have, never been one of those massively sex-obsessed types of people, didn’t even lose my virginity till last year, when I was 21. But I guess it just bothers me to think about sometimes. Guess the urges come up and it’s depressing to think I can’t really see how I’ll ever be able to satisfy them. 

Don’t like people. Always felt pretty alone. Had a big group of “friends” in school, always had people gravitate to me in jobs and stuff too but I’ve never felt connected to any of them, really. Would always end up moving away eventually and have ghosted almost 100% of people who’ve entered my life. Met one girl once, at my second job and she is really the only friend I’ve ever really had. Long story short, I fell in love with her and she didn’t feel the same way and that basically lead to the death of that friendship. Needed to happen, in hindsight, it was basically torture being in love with the only person I enjoy spending time with but knowing she doesn’t feel the same way. But it didn’t make it any less shitty.

Anyway, I tried to move on after her. Got a new job, met other girls, lost my virginity. Problem was, every girl I was with just made me feel kinda sick. Just felt weird, and end up having… performance issues. Haven’t been able to orgasm during sex once. At first I thought it was my meds, so I came off them. Didn’t help. Had people suggest it was because I watched too much porn or something but I rarely ever do. Wasn’t nervous the whole time or anything either. Just felt this weird, sick feeling. Just felt depressed. Only common denominator in all my encounters was that I didn’t really feel anything for the girls I was with. 

I tried to feel something for them. Only a few were one night stands I’d never met or planned on seeing again. Most were co-workers from various bars I worked at, girls who I honestly seemed to have chemistry with, many of whom were clearly interested in a relationship with me. But I dunno, once I actually tried it, it’s like I just realised I was numb. I looked at them and felt nothing. Eventually I’d realise it wasn’t happening for me and I’d always find a way to ask them to leave. 

I guess I’m just realising how fucked my sex life is now. How I don’t really see a way for it to ever get better. It’s pretty clear I can’t have sex with girls I don’t feel an emotional connection to, but I can’t hunk of anything I want to avoid more than forming another connection like that with someone. I don’t really think there’s a solution. I know people say shit like “you’ll meet the right person eventually, don’t give up!” but I don’t *want* to meet that person. If I did, it’d only be so that I could satisfy my sexual thoughts for once, but just that. I wouldn’t want them to stick around afterwards or be a part of my life. 

I guess I just can’t enjoy sex unless I love someone but I can’t ever let myself have that kinda power over me ever again since it made me almost kill myself the last time. And if it’s a toss up between my mental health and a healthy sex life, I obviously have to prioritise my mental health because without that, I can’t function, whereas I can get by without sex. I guess I’m just sick of having to take normal things everyone else seems to take for granted and sacrifice them in order to stay functional.

TL;DR - I can’t have sex unless I’m in love, and I can’t allow myself to fall in love because of what it’s down to me in the past."

This whole year it felt like I was just surviving, everyday felt like a chore. The only thing I anticipated during the day was going to sleep. At least then I didnt feel shitty about myself and didn't have to think. I graduated from high school in May(barely passing) and wasn't happy, just relieved to get it over with. It felt like at any moment I would cry. It went on like this for about a month. I would sit at home and ""be lazy"". I was too depressed to even realize it even though i was being lazy and aggressive. This made me feel even shittier bc I always blamed myself instead of being able to properly reflect. (I think that's one thing people don't understand about depression. If someone you know is depressed and they just start ""complaining"", please listen, its always best to just listen).

 I argued constantly with my parents about me being lazy and never doing chores in the house. The thing they didnt understand is that it felt like an impossible thing for me to do. What I needed was for them to provide comfort and ask ""what's wrong?"" I needed them to hear me out, but our guardians aren't perfect. In one argument my mother yelled that she was tired of me and needed to get me out of the house. I yelled back that I was tired of her too and finally applied for a job. Applying for the job also felt like a ginormous chore. But at last I applied and had an interview with the manager.

 My mental health was in such a bad state at that time that I cried at the interview. Everything was going well until he asked questions about myself and what I was proud of. This question felt impossible to answer. But I sat quiet and tried my best to answer the question without crying. But tears came flowing as I said I couldn't answer the question. He told me that I graduated and that, that was a great accomplishment. But I didnt feel the same, I just told him that I really needed the job. Not only to pay rent, but to get out of the house. I told him I would try my best. I could tell he felt bad and brought me some napkins. I was so embarrassed and felt like someone might be looking and judging. After I left I just kept thinking on how I could let myself cry and gaslighted myself into thinking that I manipulated the manager into hiring me. All the things I now realized once reflecting on them again. 

But I got hired and my first few months working there was not pretty. That store was the busiest in the whole country so the amount of stress put upon me was overwhelming. I would shake and sweat from the anxiety and stress from my job. As well as what my coworkers might think about me, which heightened my anxiety. The environment was a bit toxic which didn't help, but at least I found some coworkers that were nice. For the first few months I was irrational and unhealthy. People didn't understand and took it as me being stupid and mean. I really didn't like that bc it wasn't me. I didn't like being mean to people, but my emotions took over me, which I now realized. I'm beginning to accept that none of it was my fault, it was my past trauma that really damaged me. Starting from when I was about 5 years old.

I was bullied by my cousins. Actually, I think it was my whole family even my siblings and parents. My parents said I always too sensitive and dramatic. My brother said I was stupid for always trying to hang out with my cousins. But I just wanted them so bad to like me. My aunts and uncles also chimed into making fun of me and getting annoyed when I would cry. I think this is what developed my adhd, which I never got diagnosed for. Looking back I could see all the signs were so clear, but people just took me as the hyper, sensitive, dramtic and annoying girl. I had friends in middle school, but it was no doubt that my energy would bug others. Something I couldnt help. 

I eventually got into baking as a passion and a way to get my cousins to like me. It would make me happy when they would eat my desserts. But I remember that shameful look they would make when trying to grab one of my cupcakes. The one look on their face questioning how i dont resent them and allow them to grab a bite. All the things become so clear as I became an adult. But as my passion for baking grew so did my size. Then came in my moms misogynic and religious comments. 

She was aggravated at my weight gain and shamed me whenever I ate. I remember this one time I grabbed a can of coca cola and she told me that was enough. Then id tell her it was my first. This behavior continued on till my junior year of high school. The comments werent as brutal anymore. But damn do people take advantage of children just so they could feel powerful. They yell at them bc there is no real consequence towards themselves. Anyways, my mom would yell at me in the 7th grade why i was eating so much. I was binging on a bowl of snacks and had no self control due to her. Ha she got the opposite results she expected😂😕. 

When i would go to school I started skipping breakfasts in the hope that i would lose weight. Oh how my stomach would growl during class. But this led to my binging disorder. I dont think I got over it till sophmore or junior year. But this developed my body and facial dysmorphia. Along with a combination of adhd i was in for a roller coaster of emotions. I entered high school and was a people pleaser. I had no sense of identity and my anxiety was at its worst. I complained often and was unable to control my angry outbursts. My grades plummeted year after year. I could see the look of anger in my teachers eyes for not turing in work and ""being lazy"". Instead of asking what was wrong the teachers were annoyed at me. I think that's why i liked my chemistry teacher so much. He simply respected everyone and treated everyone like humans instead of robots having to obey. By senior year i was done and no longer tried. I just wanted to pass and get through with it. College was no longer in mind and i decided not to take my ACT.

But now im here laying in bed, finally able to say that I finally feel okay. 

(Kuddos for you if you read the whole thing😅😂)"
VeryMentallyStable,2021-12-20 08:39:29+00:00,Sick of my goddamn brain making me dream about things I don’t want to think about,"Last night I had a dream that a girl I used to be in love with. Was the only real friend I think I’ve ever had but long story short, I told her I had feelings for her and it ruined everything. Haven’t spoken to her for almost a year. Haven’t seen her in person for almost 2. Decided I don’t even want her in my life anymore, if she ever contacted me again, think I’d just ignore her. Don’t want a relationship at all, can’t stand people. But then despite all that I have a stupid fucking dream about her and somehow I’m straight back to feeling like shit over the whole thing.

Feels like I have dreams about her at least once a week. Or if not her, something else I don’t want to think about. But she shows up the most. Sometimes it’s just me running into her, usually angry at her. Angry that she stopped caring just like I was always afraid she would. Angry at her for buying me stupid fucking goldfish I have to take care of, for not listening to me when I told her over and over again not to, goldfish that now serve as a daily reminder that she used to be there but isn’t anymore, just like I knew they eventually would. 

Would rather not think of her ever again, but if I have to at least those angry dreams aren’t so bad. But this one last night was the worst type. I dreamt we somehow reconnected. She told me she always had feelings for me too, but she never said anything because she wasn’t ready. We swam together in a pool for a while and eventually I held her close to me and we kissed. Then I put my hand on her back and pulled her closer while I kissed down her chest. She *wanted* me to do it. She actually wanted me. I could *feel* her in my hands. Thinking about it now even, I can remember feeling the frigid beads of water contrasting with the warmth of her skin when I touched her, the subtle goosebumps on her from the cold. I’ve never ever touched someone like that before, but it feels so *real*. 

We went to bed after that, where we just talked, just relaxed. Just felt nice to have someone next to me, someone I actually *wanted*. Who wanted me back. Then I woke up and I was alone again. I fucking hate it. Why does it have to be so vivid, so real? Why’d I have to remember it? I can’t even *do* anything about it. I don’t even want this to be real. I don’t want her in my life. I’ve thought about it a lot, been forced to every time my brain feels like dredging it back up for dream material and I know that even if this was real I wouldn’t don’t want it. I don’t want anyone, I’m happier alone. And yet every time I’m forced to live it, it depresses me when it’s gone. I’ve tried listening to those lucid dreaming videos, tried all the techniques so I can stop having these dreams but it doesn’t work. I don’t understand why my brain tortures me like this, as if I don’t already have enough shit to deal with."

kluwelyn,2021-12-19 22:05:26+00:00,I'm the shittiest person on Earth.,"**Sorry if I wasted your time. I hope achiving telling everything out off my mind.**

You could question me on the reason of my post ? To be honest even I don't know why. But I think this would be the right place to write (sorry if it is not).

So why did I come to this conclusion ? For many reasons actually :

1. I'm not intelligent. In school even if I work hard and use productive things (like pomodoros, miracle morning, meditation, yoga, ...) I always get bad grades and teachers who don't know how to help me and give up on helping me. However you could say that school intelligent don't matter and that the most important is being good in other thing or beeing good at a hobbie. 
2. Awfuly beeing a dumba\*\* I'm not good at anything. I have hobbies that I love drawing and guitar but I'm bad and not even a little good at. I'm lost I don't know where to start. I'm overwhelmed by what to do to start and where to start. I'm very stupid.
3. I'm ugly and weak branch man. I'm not musclar nor good looking. I don't know how to dress with style or good clothes. 
4. I cry a lot. I only feel good while sleeping. I'm a monster or a beta\*1000 male
5. I have friends but I think that they like me only because they have pitty for me. And when school or time will be over they' would leave me. I can see that they have a better life than me : they have friends, go to parties, have talents, are intelligent/ good at school and are very good looking (do I have to mention that I never had a boyfriend or a girlfriend)
6. I go to a psychologist and take medicines but I don't feel they're me (although I respect and like them a lot)

To be honest I don't know what to do. I feel all my hopes and my only dream fading away. My parents don't really know how to help me although they love me. I hate myself so much for not beeing a chad or normal like my friends or the persons of my age. 

I want to feel at peace but I too scrae of death and **I don't want to die or to kill myself.** My life is just boring, depressed, bland and sad. 

I think that I deserve what's happening on my life but I don' know why.

Well I think I threw eveything out of my chest. Feel free to help me and even if you try it'll make me happy. And sorry again if I wasted your time. 

I hope you'll have a better day than me."
dark_elftress,2021-12-19 21:57:05+00:00,When I say I’m only alive for my pets I mean it.,Look at it this way. I work my ass off in a sort of fast food restaurant and try my best to make my managers happy which lead to a 3$ raise. That’s cool I guess but still can’t afford my bills let alone rent with 14 an hour. I just feel that if those around me aren’t happy why should I? I don’t think about myself all that much. Mainly my pets but it’s not worth it anymore. I’m a hoarder I know that. It’s not as bad anymore but I can acknowledge I am. I’m drinking box wine out of a solo cup trying to focus on playing sims and making the mods work even tho I’m not supposed to drink on my meds due to side affects but I don’t care. Gonna pack me a bowl add wax to the top and not care anymore because I am a waste of space. Probably gonna play animal crossing later maybe. Ugh I’m just drunk and depressed trying to bandaid it with weed and meds. Later.

mazzucac,2021-12-19 17:40:41+00:00,New to depression,"I have never experienced depression in my life. Genuinely. I have never experienced anxiety, or panic attacks either. That all changed last month. 

My wife and I have been going through a tough time in our relationship. She is heavily considering ending our marriage. She has valid reasons for wanting that, but the problems she has are things I know we can work on. She moved out, back to our home city, for a bit; so she can figure out her feelings and decide what she wants. 

When she first told me her problems she was having, I was hopeful we can fix them, and keep going. Then she returned from a two week trip and was almost convinced she wants a divorce. She also had begun emotionally/mentally cheating on me with someone else. This caused me two separate severe panic attacks. As well as constant anxiety and now depression. She ended that relationship once I found out, and that’s when we decided she would move out to figure things out. 

Since the day she moved out (this 7days ago) I have become significantly more depressed every day. I can’t stop having dark (not suicidal) thoughts. I can’t motivate myself to eat, or to do anything I would normally do; clean, play games, watch movies and tv with my friends, etc. I am seriously struggling with sleeping as well. When I am at work, I have moments where I’m fine, and moments where I’m definitely not. My boss is aware and helping to distract me and work through this. 

I say all this to ask the following, what can I do? What should I do? I really want these feelings and thoughts to go away, but I’m struggling so much to make them stop. Is there anything I can do?"
stupidslutcocksucker,2021-12-19 15:36:35+00:00,Me and mom had to move to grandma★,"Hi guys! Ah where to even start.. Ah yea dad. Every since i was a kid i always liked my dad. Cool, fun, funny dad. I just dont remember why did i had to comfort mom while she was crying. I just did it anyways.

So years went by and obviously i started to look into things deeper. And it was heartbreaking to realise how disgusting and fucking crazy is my dad. It started with just voice raising, door slapping, leaving then coming back home. Now everything got fucked over. 

Yesterday started as a normal Saturday day. I helped cleaning the house, making lunch. Then the first thing that happened was that my dad noticed my pathetic scratches on my wrist made by my sharp nails thinking that i cut myself. I kept saying it was itchy then he turned into that serious mad himself and said this is fucking crazy how i should be brought to a therapist obviously. Then i finiahed eating anyways and went to my room. And then as thin my door is i heard mom and dad starting to argue. It was an usual argument nothing that interesting. Well the main reason was that my mom brought up that how my dads dad so grandpa wa sburied on her ##th birthday (important one) and that it didnt felt that good for her. And then my dad fucking snapped. Glass breaking after glass him still fucking screaming and more and more glass breaking as loud as if it was next to me, i even heard him kicking the fucking wall. I got scared to the point i couldnt realise what was happening i broke down crying tried to hide in my wardrobe. I wanted to get out of there i wanted to climb out the window but i heard the screaming got a bit quiet so i took the chance grabbed a shoe and ran away. I still heard glass breaking and dad screaming at mom. It was like 4C° but i ran, i ran 4 houses away then i tried to call grandma just to realise i dont have money on my phone. So i slowly started to walk back home hoping nobody saw me running crying in fear out of my house. So i walked back and i was waiting it was like glass was being broomed together. I saw mom going out for a smoke. She sat down smoking i was crying and telling her ""we are going to grandma right now, I dont wanna be here we are going to granma right now."" then i asked her if he hurt her but she said no. So after awhile we went back inside we went to her room. She started packing. I was having a panic attack shaking. We heard him cleaning up after himself. He broke the kitchen doors window, plates, glasses, jars. He even cut his hands. So after awhile he came in the room and said to me ""i apologies to you it wasnt meant for you"" then he said to mom ""but ill never forgive you"" i was like ok.. Then i also went to pack my stuff in a big bag and when he saw he said ""you too huh? Youre going to move to grandma?"" i said no we will be there for some days. Then back in my room he even asked for bandages and kept going on about how he would have had a stroke if he didnt break things and etc. And after that he left. He went off somewhere with his car. Me and mom packed the moat important things even the 2 dogs and went to grandma.

So here we are today is the day after that and i knew this would happen, mom and dads relationship has already ended years ago. But this.. This way? Im underage obviously under the age of 16. I was trying my best to call someone to come as fast as they can but oh well. I was scared for my life i thought he will come into my room and beat me too because of those scars. But mom said he didnt hurt her. Mom said she will only talk to him in court but they will probably talk anyways. Here at grandmas things are going alright, i kind of got this room for myself, mom too the dogs are fine. Mom looks worse than ever tho. Thankfully its winter break so i could rest my mind even after this shit.

We are still thinking about what will happen. In the school i still got 1 and a half year. My mom can work anywhere. There are atill things to think about like a lot. And to be honest i just wanna rest."

It used to be just about claustrophobia, but it has gone to self harming and dying kinda nightmares. Even if i had slept for more than 9 hours i always feel tired because of the dreams i see at night. They are so real and i always remember even all the tiniest details. Often they don’t bother me that much but when i see something like drowning myself it really freaks me out. I’m on mirtazapin medication for better sleep but it doesnt help the nightmares. And what’s the most disturbing about them is that i always remember literally everything forever. Most people apparently forget what they have dreamed about after they wake up, but i can probably remember all nightmares i’ve had since highschool. Anybody having similar experiences? Sometimes i tell my friend or my therapist what kinda nightmare i had this time, and they just usually answer with a shoked reaction and words like ”thats horrible”. I often think that all the nightmares have some kind of meaning, but Idk i feel kinda stubid about writing this all here."

Im tired of people telling me to work on myself and ""it'll get better"" when it clearly fucking won't. 
Maybe if I was beautiful guys would love me. Maybe if I was smart I wouldn't be failing in school and could actually make a life for myself. 

I'm tired of the anxiety and the depression, I'm tired of being afraid all the time and having to be around My piece of shit mom and her abusive boyfriend. I thought I could make it until I'm 18 at least, but I can't. 17 years of this is more than enough. My mom should've had the abortion when she had the chance. Im a stupid ugly disgusting freak that needs to die. Im a nobody, I'm nothing. My life is worthless, I'm worthless. Im a disgrace. Im an abomination. I should just grab my knife and slit my fucking wrists wide open.  

Whats the point in living if I have nothing to live for."

yezenite,2021-12-19 00:16:15+00:00,Losing will power and interest...,"Hello everyone, 

I have extreme executive dysfunction due to depression and ADHD. Because of this, it's very tough for me to translate my intentions into actions at all while my emotions and instincts take control over me. My mind is all over the place and it's very hard to do things in an organized manner. 

This, single-handedly, has ruined my developmental life completely. Nothing I ever willed came to be. Maybe only occasionally. If I found interest and passion in art, I would struggle to draw at all. Even if I do draw, the drawings are never finished. This goes for everything I like and want. I can't even call my loving parents because there is no cooperation from my body, or, as I learned, from me. It felt as though I had limbs that work, but those limbs work on their own. They wouldn't feed me or let me walk if I wanted to, but they would do what they deem their own best interest, disregarding my own.

Over the years I tried to ""cure"" myself with no success whatsoever. I fought very hard to take control over every nerve in my body, but none of it mattered. After all, you have no say in management if your only title is founder or ex owner. You also have no say in a government where a coup was performed against you. Said cures were only temporary, none of it lasted more than a week. Cures ranged from oedipus pacts to self help treatments to therapy to medication, but nothing ever worked for long. Some cures have actually made my life worse. Most notably, medications. 

The way medications were prescribed to me made me feel that it would help my situation. What I didn't know, however, was that it was a gamble on my LIFE. I saw the warning on the box for antidepressants saying that suicide is a side effect, but, at the time, I didn't think much of it. I thought it was a mindset thing and that if I keep will-powering through everything I wouldn't get these terrible side effects. I also saw that they worked for many people and that they may work for me. I was wrong. I have never thought as much about suicide as the time I took medications. It was due to a multitude of things, but mainly the fact that they are supposed to fix your problem but they don't if you're incompatible with them, and every time you switch medications to find one more compatible, you have to suffer through A LOT of side effects. After a while, I went through my final side effect (the worst one: serotonin syndrome) and stopped medications completely. ""No more, I'm done,"" I thought.

Medications were supposed to be my final solution, a solution that works. But they weren't, and so the following 2 months were nothing but despair because nothing I ever tried worked. Even modifying myself biologically through medications didn't work. These 2 months were the worst months of my life because all I had thought of is how years and years of effort to do something as simple as doing what I want was an impossible act, something other people have as a given. No one ever understands this whenever they ask me why I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do or why I'm laying in bed all day. They don't see why I'm not like them: able to will every action into existence, and I'm, frankly, tired. No one every gives useful advice because they assume I'm like them, and when I explain my situation, I get told that I'm deluded into thinking that.

At the biggest low point of my life, I decided to put my useless body to use, and donated as much blood as I could possibly muster to a red bus. The organization that I donated from had a notification system where it tells you about every life you saved with your blood, and every time I got all 3 notifications for all 3 lives I've saved, made me feel useful and amazing. This event spiraled into absolute passion and excitement to help every person I possibly could, and through all the excitement, I was able to gain executive status over my body. It was as though I was rewarded for my altruism. At the time, I didn't know how long it would last, so I decided to create a system from all that I learned throughout the years that would help me keep doing good deeds even after my executive license expires.

At this point, I was at the highest point in my life. I have done so much progress and was able to will actions into existence seemlessly! It was amazing! And I was able to pull through so many struggles that I had and beat them like they were nothing! I helped so many people and did so many great things, it was like a dream!

Unfortunately, however, all good things must come to an end, and today is that day. I have run out of will power completely. I have returned to the extreme urge of just laying down in bed and doing nothing all day as well as having complete disinterest in anything and apathy towards everything. Even though those dream-like events only lasted a month and a half, they were the best month and a half in my life, and I couldn't ask for better. Now all that is left is to see if the back up system I have set up for myself will pull me through to keep doing good or not. Only time will tell, but I am glad that all of this happened :)"

Anonym0m,2021-12-18 23:07:45+00:00,Acknowledging it doesn't feel right. It feels more like an excuse I've conjured to hide apathy or laziness.,"I'm depressed. I have been since high school. I recognize it in hindsight, having slept through nearly my entire junior year.

Though, acknowledging it doesn't feel right. It feels more like an excuse I've conjured to hide apathy or laziness.

In fact, I'm not lazy. I work 8-5, or 6, or 7, or 5am in the morning. I've worked side jobs simultaneously for a decade. I'm the single mother of a young, only child. 3 jobs, 4, 5, I've been there. I am there.

I'm in hiding. Suffering from smiling depression or high functioning depression perhaps. 

My coworkers, network, acquaintances, and surface friends have no clue ... at least, I don't think they do. The part I play is well rehearsed. When my public facade begins to crack, I go into hiding.

I have a moderately successful career, an active social presence, and a kempt appearance.

I've spoken about my thoughts with two family members. The only two I've got. They have their own lives, wants, concerns,  priorities. We are close and we are not close.

I hardly sleep. 3am triggers my internal alarm. When I do find rest, I sleep for hours on end.

For 20 years, I hardly ate. Once I began, I started binging. I gained 20 lbs in a month.

I've been smoking for 20 years and it feels like the least of my problems.

I question every inch of everything, study, research, over analyze. I spend hours, full days and/or nights sometimes, searching for answers to problems that just won't quit. I do so without breaks. It's madness really.

I dwell on things for far too long. Unable to let go. Unable to move on. I obsess.

It's 2am right now. Tonight's topic is depression. Am I depressed? If I write it out, will I be able to see it? Believe it? Find an answer?

I've thought about suicide. I've made no plans, nothing concrete anyhow, but I have thought about the how. I've thought about some of the things I'll need to take care of first - for my daughter.

On that note, I'll never leave her. Never, never, never, never, never. I wouldn't dare harm her in this way. I would never jeopardize her health, happiness, and potential. I love her more than words. I will sacrifice my all.

Thoughts of suicide merely serve as a temporary escape. A moment of reprieve - damn this is fucked up.

I do not have insurance. I do not qualify for Medicaid and I cannot afford coverage in addition to living and child care costs. I do this alone.

It would be nice to speak with someone but... ah well.

Some of my other posts reveal that I am a survivor of domestic violence. I've been fighting to maintain my daughter's saftey in court for years. The system is broken and I am perpetually afraid. I still think about how we'll escape if her father ever shows up with a gun.

My mother is numb. Void of emotion or concern. Hell, she allowed me to sleep through that junior year without a word. She saw no issue leaving me (17) in LA with a 60 year old roommate who insisted on ""holding my hand."" Her lack of action is not intentional. It is a condition of her upbringing.

I housed and cared for my abusive, alcoholic, sick and dying father for 8 years. I did so while I worked and attended school. I remember sitting up nights listening to him cough. I sat alone with him as he died. I sang him out.

I began my young adult life on the street with a group of ""lost boys"" after witnessing the accidental death of a friend. We found food, warmth, and shelter in various places. We stuck together. This may have been the only time in my life I felt safe. Homeless and safe - Ha! I was surrounded by people I could trust and depend on.

I never quit ... never. I triumphed through it all. I rose, and rose, and rose. I educated myself, worked obsessively, and launched my career. I've given the sun, moon, and stars to my amazing child. I've safeguarded her thus far at the expense of my sanity.

👆 These posts are attached to another (less anonymous) account. I've mentioned suicide here and I wouldn't dare allow for a slip that would cost me my child.

So, yes, it's clear why I suffer.

I'm just tired and desperately sad. Perhaps, another devastating life trial is the answer.

Too busy, to beaten, and to fraught to dwell in sadness is the best headspace for me.

I could use some help.

- Love waves from me to you"

Emotionally, verbally, physically. Used me. Used my body. Cheated on me. Hurt me everyday for 2 years. We had a home together that he kept and is bringing women over day in and day out. Is probably dating someone. All while I’m reeling from this break up, dealing with the stress of court, as well as trauma and mental health issues. Bipolar depression. Ptsd. Anxiety. I’m so tired. I don’t want to do this anymore. I’m back on my meds now.. hopefully it helps. I don’t want to do this anymore but I don’t want to leave my parents to grieve me.

It's not like I've never wanted to have friends or a boyfriend who isn't a total douche, and I do occasionally talk to people in real life and online.

Over the months they either upped the dose or changed them up to a different type. Still things continued of a slow downward spiral. I've had CBT, NLT, tried hypnosis, meditation, distraction therapy and still no change. 
Eventually I've been referred to a mental health unit to he assessed and they believe the root of this maybe that I have some type of ASD and or ADHD. Great I thought, I may be getting somewhere. Now I need further assessment"

Chirnside16,2021-12-17 15:03:12+00:00,what's the difference between self pity and depression,ive been told to stop pitying myself but is that rlly the case. am I choosing to feel this way? it doesn't feel like it but at the same time its something I'm accusing myself of.
upset_ricebowl,2021-12-17 12:17:03+00:00,Feeling guilty and overthinking over everything,"I feel like this has been getting worse recently. My guilt gets so worse to the point that even though a situation doesn't involve me, i'll still blame myself for it. Like I don't know; maybe there was a train disruption.... I would just usually think that ""Maybe if  I wasn't here or born this wouldn't happen."" 
I know its extremely stupid and hold no real grounds at all. My past therapist called this 'assuming without any clear evidence'.

Everytime I fuck up *which is always* in front of people, I just feel like everyone just judging me for my mistakes. For everything I got away with being depressed and (kinda) suicidal, I just feel so bad because im so privileged that I was able to get away when others couldn't. I compare myself to ppl who have it worse than me and it always makes me feel much more horrible lol.

I do know how to stop thinking like this lesser but it just... feels so tiring to be like ""OMG NO ONE GIVE A SHIT ITS NOT YOUR FAULT OKAY"" every single time i think negatively idk"
unterrogatory,2021-12-17 10:52:50+00:00,I am turning 22 today. And I am in a very dark place.,"It’s hard to believe it’s only my 22nd year of living. It feels like it’s been much longer. This age, this year, this time… it feels lonely, disheartening, and aimless. Nothing makes sense anymore. I feel unprepared for what’s to come. I feel inadequate. I have a constant sense of discontent and unrest deep down in my soul. Every waking moment is a cage match between anxiety and futility. 

I am resentful. I am resentful that my own father would psychologically manipulate and abuse me before I was even old enough to understand. I am resentful that at 9 years old, I had to call an ambulance for my seizing mother as my father got in his truck and drove away. I am resentful that my father alienated any family I had and there was no one to run to for support or love or kindness. I am resentful that these traumatic experiences robbed me of my childhood innocence, and I am now complimented for my maturity.

I am deeply sad. I am sad because I have not lived up to my own expectations. I have sorely and profoundly disappointed myself time and time again. I am sad because I take a leap of faith and fall on my face every. Single. Time. I am sad because I have fallen short of goals so many times that I no longer bother to set them. I am sad because I have disappointed other people so often and so monumentally that I prefer to be alone.

I am anxious. I am anxious because I know I will not survive this way and I cannot find a way out. I am anxious because I am married to a wonderful woman who tries like hell to lift me up out of the disaster I’ve created, but she can’t understand what has happened to me because she has not witnessed the crushing of her own soul. I am anxious because I feel the weight of my existence grow heavier and heavier as I do less and less to carry the load.

I have become something I never knew a person could become. I don’t recognize myself in the mirror because I have never truly known who I am. I have survived for 22 years. I have existed for 22 years. But I have not lived for 22 years."

I was the go-to guy that everyone asked for help and now it’s all fucked and I don’t know how to fix it. The only reason I passed this semester is because I cheated on everything. I don’t even know how to do what my career requires me to do.

They know what they want from life and how to get it meanwhile I’m stuck living the same awful life every day all alone. Even when I tell people around me what I’m studying, some seem surprised as if they could never picture me having success in that career.

The focusing and concentration pain has gone down and all that. However, it wasn’t my finals that broke me, it was one of my friends. Even though we are both in the same kind of math class and this is their second time doing the class, they have yet to get a tutor. So I had to teach them all the concepts they didn’t understand yesterday and today, their fucking final is tomorrow. I had to go home earlier today so we called and I helped them. While helping them my headache got worse but they still needed help so I continued until my head was pounding but I was internally picturing their murder because I went over how to do that shit literally five minutes ago but they don’t know fucking shit!

To start, I'm 18[M] and I've never had a real relationship or sexual experience. It might not sound like a big deal, and honestly it probably isn't, but I see everyone around me that succeeds at it so often. My best friend makes it look easy and my dad tells me story's of his highschool days and early adulthood about many relationships and hookups he had. Everyone my age nowadays is on snapchat and I see my friends meet people like that all the time, but I just can't do it. I'm not good at starting or maintaining conversations online, and it's weird because I'm good at talking in person, it's something I'm proud of. But I pay attention to facial expressions and social cues and I can't do that online. And I know what your saying ""Just go meet girls in person then"" I wish I could. I work with my dad and a farmer, and both of those places are not the places where you meet girls, after work I don't have time to do anything, and even if I did, I don't know where I'd go. My weekends are usually full with working around the house or hunting with a friend.

I feel like a romantic failure and I don't know how to fix it. I could try talking to people online, but I know how it'll go. Advice of any kind would be appreciated."

burtacomoose,2021-12-16 21:01:24+00:00,Alcoholism or Death,"Speaking to any dually diagnosed alcoholic/depressed people. What's a better way to go if you had to choose? Functional alcoholism or suicide? I've been sober for about 5 months and I've been sober before for longer periods of time. Anyway, regardless of how long I remain sober, I just can't find any reason to live my life. If I'm drunk, I don't care. Why should I continue to just suffer along day after day? Is it to appease the few people that would mourn my absence? I'm really not having a good time and there's no end to this meaningless monotony. Booze makes not only the pain go away, but the search for unreachable contentment stops as well. I don't want to drink, but I can't find any reason to exist while sober. So, from a completely objective standpoint, is it better to die or be a drunk?"
jtsully,2021-12-16 20:45:27+00:00,I can’t find anybody and I feel like I have no future.,"I’m reaching my mid 20’s and I don’t have my shit together. I haven’t had any girlfriends since high school. It’s not so much the fact that I can’t talk to girls or that I’m unattractive (compared to most other guys my age I think I was pretty fortunate), but just that I literally cannot find anybody. I’ve tried everywhere: malls, bookstores, supermarkets, even bars (and I fucking hate bars, I don’t even drink). I’m just not attracted to any girls I see in public, and the very few times I do find them attractive they’re either taken or it’s like we’re from two different planets. Whether it be common interests, hobbies, lifestyles, professions, religion, politics or whatever else, I just cannot connect with this generation of women on any level. There’s also the paranoid fear she’ll be one of those chicks who acts nice but really she’s looking to fuck you over and I’ll become a victim of cancel culture. I’ve thought about moving to another state but Covid has really fucked me over career wise. I lost my temp job, would have gotten full time and finally gotten hooked up with a job that offers a pension if it weren’t for the pandemic. I joined the Army thinking I would be doing good things serving my country, but these vaccine mandates are killing us. I don’t have a problem with vaccines, but I feel conforming to a forced mandate goes against what we signed up for. So me and a couple of my buddies are getting kicked out, just don’t know when yet. My life is just a complete mess right now. It doesn’t help that I was diagnosed with autism at a young age and my parents have held my hand to the point where I don’t know how to do fucking anything on my own. I don’t know if I’ll ever be financially stable, and if I ever am I still feel like I need to sort myself out first before I can start taking care of somebody else. I may just die alone."

This is a tough time of year for me my sister died in 2007 her birthday is on Sunday and not having her here for the holidays is terrible. My mother has a raging alcoholic who Uninvited me to Christmas because I said I was worried about her health. She has had two strokes in the last 4 years and I'm not ready to watch her kill herself with drinking and smoking. I made that clear I also made it clear that it affects my sobriety and my mental health instead of being understanding of that she lashed out at me made up lies and told me that I never gave a shit about my deceased sister. 

She then tried to buy her way into my good graces by telling me she was sending me Christmas gifts I said ""you can go ahead and send them and then I'm going to donate them to charity. The best thing that you can do is donate some money to the charity that helps fight to find a cure for the disease that my sister died from that would be the best way to make an amends for what you said to me!""

The only thing I have to look forward to as a friend of mine is coming to visit me from the Midwest because she also has a toxic family and doesn't want to spend time with them over Christmas.

I have been extremely depressed since last Friday and I really can't shake it. But on a good note I have over three years and nine months sober."

I am currently a Junior in college now, and although my anxiety has gotten better with various medications over time, my depression has worsened.

I didn’t have the most traditional path in life but no matter what goal I reach I’m never happy. I always feel like I need to be better or that I’m falling behind where I need to be at the stage in my life. I have to do things to keep my mind from going to bad places but I’m exhausting myself. It’s self inflicting and now I don’t want to do anything. I wanna quit my job and live a different life but that kinda thing isn’t very smart or possible. I live a decent life but maybe I’m comparing myself to others too much. Maybe it’s a symptom of me spending years trying to attain “regular” people goals like buying a house or being financially stable. I haven’t been able to reach those goals and I’m starting to feel like it’ll never happen and I’ll just continue to be another cog in the wheel until I die. I don’t know how people stay happy and I barely know what that truly feels like anymore. Any recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks everyone for letting me vent.
nostalgia_ridden,2021-12-16 05:37:02+00:00,Neverending Question of Depression or Laziness,"It's finals week and instead of doing my work, I'm being lazy and not turning things in on time if at all. I can't seem to be able to do anything for myself. The only way I've been able to turn assignments in this semester was if they were a quick assignment that would take only an hour or so max to complete and turn in, or if I was in a group with someone else. 

Being in a group with someone else, I always prioritized getting that stuff done first (even if it was a little bit last minute) because I didn't want to affect their grades. I was determined to finish my part, however small or big it was when I was working in a group together with other people because it wasn't just me I would be letting down in that case. 

But when I try to do any assignments for myself. I feel stuck, like I can't even start on them. I often end up just not doing it at all, or turning it in so late I might as well not have. I can't seem to do anything right anymore. It feels like I'm feeling guilt, frustration, and apathy all at once when it comes to trying to do my own things. It's like it doesn't matter anymore because I give up, but there is also a sense of anxiety that these things in my mental to-do list will never be finished because I can't bring myself to finish them.

I just feel tired of trying for myself. I don't feel motivated to eat either. When I only have myself to feed, I just grab some instant food like ramen, frozen, or microwaveable food and call it a day. I can only seem to put the effort into cooking something if I someone says they'll eat it or if I manage to convince myself that someone will come home soon and eat it so I make extra. Things feel so much easier when I have a person to do them for. 

I often crave some food, and ask my sister if she wants some, because if she doesn't, then it just doesnt feel worth it to make, and I just end up not eating at all. I've gone weeks where I would just eat once a day because anything else was too much trouble and it just wasn't worth the energy I had to spend when I had more important things to do like work and school assignments. 

I feel like I'm just letting everyone down with how stupid I am, especially my wonderful and patient professor. She's been so patient with me this semester and I've really been trying. This morning, she informed me that she could no longer take in my late work without late deductions, and honestly, I am just fortunate that she even put up with me. 

I don't know what I'm doing and things feel hopeless. I think I might have depression but also I don't feel super down right now? I just feel like a nuisance and it feelings feel more like nothing at the same time. I am probably fine and being dramatic because other people definitely have it worse than me."

I’m just tired of being constantly tired and feeling worn down all the time. I feel like I will never get above water because of my debt. I live in the south where pay is crap and everything around us is going up…rent, food, bills…everything but wages. This just sucks. Who wants to live like this. Any depression makes me too tired to get any type of side hustle going that would even be worth spending MORE time away from my kid or sacrificing the small amount of sanity I have left."

I knew what she meant by this, so I asked why? to see if she'd have the balls to say it. And she did. She said you two put on some weight. My boyfriend laughed it off.  I, however, am trying not to spiral out back into a freaking eating disorder. I've been skinny for my whole life as a child then around 20 I started putting on weight then stayed about the same until 24 and I'm not obese or anything just uncomfortable in my body and my weight goes up and down so much so it's hard to adjust. It's a silly thing to worry about esp when I see people who are larger than me all the time and I think nothing of it. Most of the time they look absolutely fine so I don't know why it bothers me that I'm not skinny anymore. Anyways..I'm just uncomfortable now since she poked at an insecurity I have and idk it's making me sad and I'm actually really hungry right now but I don't want to eat anything"
VeryMentallyStable,2021-12-16 01:38:28+00:00,Thinking about relationships makes me physically sick,"I don’t know why it’s something I think about so much. Guess despite how I feel about relationships, I’m still lonely. Feels like a sick joke that my brain simultaneously can’t stand the thought of being with someone but constantly laments how alone I am. Not that I’d even want to have people around, I prefer being alone. It’s a choice. I don’t like people knowing me, don’t like them knowing anything about me. Don’t really care to know anything about anyone else either. Never been the type to have any friends or anything. I’ll try, when I start a new job or something but I can only put up with it for so long before I have to move away, delete all my social media and disappear again. 

Anyway, I guess it’s come up again not too long ago because I was talking to this girl, she messaged me here on Reddit. We were talking for a while, guess she related to things I’d posted or something. After a couple months I realised she was dancing around the fact that she had feelings for me. Maybe part of me even had some for her, I don’t even know. But once I realised that I didn’t really know what to do. Talking to her, she was one of very few people I didn’t immediately hate. I still had days where I just wanted her to leave me alone and I didn’t want to talk to anyone, but it was at least bearable enough of the time that I kept talking to her for months, I guess.

She never got to tell me she had feelings for me, if she ever even would have. I stopped talking to her before she could. That’s what I landed on after days of conflicted feelings about what to do. Part of me wondered if I did have some feelings, if maybe I should bring it up with her and try to work on it or something. But then I thought that if I have so many messages telling me I wasn’t attracted to her, then at least part of me mustn’t be and therefore I’d just be settling for her to kill my loneliness, which is unfair for everyone involved. 

I’ve never been in an actual relationship and the thing is, I think I only like the idea of them. Only like the handful of “scenes” that pop into my head when I think about them. But to get to those moments, you have to go through a lot of stuff in between, in fact the in between parts are most of it, and I think that’s where I know they’re not for me. Thinking about real relationships, what they actually are day-to-day, it makes me physically sick. I live with my mum and her husband right now, and watching them together just disgusts me. The way they talk to each other, the things they talk about, the things they get excited about, it’s all so pathetic. It’s fucking sad. My throat tightens up when I hear them laughing in the next room. And it’s not just them, being around anyone in a relationship makes me feel like that. It’s why I can’t go to weddings. And that’s the stuff I’d have to be able to endure to get to the “scenes” I fantasise about all the time, so that’s how I know I’m not meant for a relationship.

Another thing it made me think about, something that comes up every time I have a close call with a relationship like this, is that I just can’t be attracted to someone who’s into me. I don’t know why, don’t know what it is exactly, but as soon as I figure out someone has a crush on me, it’s an instant turn-off. I don’t know how to describe it exactly, it’s like the dynamic shifts and they feel beneath me, like they’re smaller. I guess I’d need to feel like someone was my equal to be interested and then having feelings for me feels like it puts them beneath me. Maybe that sounds bad, just don’t know how else to word it. But I guess, weirdly enough, I can only be attracted to women who don’t like me back, or at least would never admit it. I’ve always had a thing for cold, emotionally unavailable girls and maybe that’s why. 

A lot of the time it feels like a girl being nice and caring towards me is also a turn off. And while that’s mostly true, I don’t think I could ever be with someone long-term who was kind and gentle, I also don’t think it’s entirely true. Going back to those “scenes” that play in my head, some of them involve being emotionally vulnerable with each other, but it’s reluctant, I guess, or some of them involve being cared for but it’s more unspoken. So I think it’s more that I can’t handle someone who’s always expressing their feeling to me and when they do, I need to feel like I’ve earned it, like if they do love me on some level, that I earned that love.

Anyway, there’s probably some psychological reasons behind it all, guess it doesn’t really matter though. Brought it up in therapy a few times, but as with all things in therapy, it never seemed to go anywhere and I honestly don’t even know where I would like it to go. Think at this point I’d just like someone to flip off the switch that makes part of me feel like I want a relationship at all, so I could just live on knowing they’re not for me and never having to think about any of it ever again."

""I will never leave you"". I say these thoughts over and over  Depression causes our inner child to be terrified. Most of us have been abused and traumatized by other people for years.

A quiet place. Somewhere there's no regrets or might just be somewhere to speak out our regrets.
Imagination calls forth a  reality we wanna chase.It gives us hope and happiness or atleast the illusion of it. Happiness that's always wrapped on the very reality that we so wanna disappear from.
It's a sweet sweet gift of cruelty, reminding ourselves how it would feel to have what we lost, to have what we never get to hold.
We torture ourselves for the brief touch of happiness that precedes our life.
What's the meaning of taking control of yourself if you only did it after throwing away everything that makes you happy?"
radhika1710,2021-12-15 16:51:29+00:00,"(please don't read, just a rant) sNobody from my family ever thinks.....","That i cook good food or take care of them. I got married 10 years ago, i was working but had to leave my job as my husbabd was in another city.

I was so much happy with my job but due to circumstances i left and to fill that void and also to just make myself and my husband and my fil happy i started cooking. Although i was cooking since i was 12, i never gave it any importance. But i used to make good food as i had won many competitions.

So when i started to cook for my husband and fil, my fil started calling me ""proudy"". My husband loves that i cook variety of dishes but my inlaws never even gives me a compliment.

In between for 7 years we were living far from my inlaws and the new friends i made loved my food. I have made lifelong relationships with them. But now as we are back to same city as my inlaws i have to put up with them.

They come over, and they only eat homemade food, so i make, but they never even say food was good. In fact they say, food is not a priority in their life. (also they don't like if i wear good clothes on festivals, or if  we have good things etc, they say it's all unnecessary)

I am not in any position to start a job as we have to move to new city when my husband's work from home ends, neither i can start selling my food as we are living very far from city. I feel like i sm useless and dumb to give food, clothes, clean house such importance.

The way life is going, i will be good for nothing. I sometimes just want my life to end, i am living just for my son. I wish i was never born. My life is only good because my husband and my son loves me. I have stopped loving or even liking myself."
r4bbidwomb4t,2021-12-15 14:50:43+00:00,Still wishing i would have died,At the begining of 2020 my wife cheated on me and left me. But she did not tell me. She blocked me on facebook and changed her relationship status as dateing another. I only found out because she had not unfriended a mutual friend. After finding out and confronting her she showed zero remorse. We have two children together and i have not seen them in almost 19 months. She moved far away and i have no car also were married for 4 years and had a ten year relationship. It ended up sending me into a depressive spiral. So deep i attempted to take my own life. I overdosed on pills but was found in time that i was saved. After getting out of the mental hospital i was homless and unemployed. I started getting my life back together and met someone new . My life was starting to get better. We had a great 17 months together. But she decided to leave me. Once again i have become unemployed and homeless. The depression is dark again. But not suicidal. But i do wish because of all the pain i am going though that i would have died that day.

LumiGloomy,2021-12-14 17:35:46+00:00,Anxiety sucks,"My online friend asked me to go for a walk and vc with them. We’ve been kinda strained and they know I’m struggling with my mental health so that’s also causing me to panic as I’m not good at talking out loud. 

But It’s also not so simple for me to just leave the house. First off I rarely go out and I don’t go out alone. If a family member is home telling them why I’m going out alone is hard because it’s so out of character. 

I still feel odd having online friends because of internet safety even though I’ve been friends with this person for 5 years and I’m confident they are who they say they are. I am still careful with them. I only Voice chatted a few times with this friend but it was when we were playing a game so I was able to tell my family that’s what’s happening and it’s kind of normal, my siblings have vc with others too. But I don’t know how to say I’m going to go on a walk to have a regular conversation with an online friend. 

There’s very little privacy in the house to begin with just because of thin walls and my room being beside two others, you’ll hear anything I’m saying. I’m not confident talking on the phone around other people and I act differently with my friends. You know I joke differently, it’s nothing bad I just think it would be weird for my them to see me like that. And if my friend wants to talk about anything serious I need privacy for that. This is why I ended up sitting outside for every therapy phone appointment because I don’t want other ears listening in. That was the only place I felt I had the most privacy, not complete privacy, I had neighbours pass by multiple times, but as much as I could around my home.

I kind of concluded the best place to talk to them would be in my house or on my step rather than go for an actual walk. I’m terrified of people from the simplest reason of being looked at to the most paranoid, what if they attack me? I decided one way is too public and I can’t cross the intersection. Once I forgot to wait for turning cars and haven’t been confident doing that alone anymore. I grew up in a small town I’m still not sure how to handle city streets even with crosswalk signs. 

The other way is a very long road with only a few buildings on either side but they’re far apart and because of that it kind if feels secluded which also freaks me out because I feel more vulnerable. And we aren’t necessarily in the safest area. 

But before I even make it out the door I don’t know if the landlord will be around. I’m scared of my landlord even more now that my house doesn’t even feel like a safe place since he’s let himself inside once. Even though he probably won’t do it again as he knows he stepped out of line and it was illegal. It’s the fact he did it to begin with and now I can’t trust he won’t do it again which is causing anxiety attacks whenever he comes around to do yard work. Unless it’s in the late afternoon I can’t sit on my step and be sure I won’t see him. 

So ya, that’s why anxiety sucks. A simple question turned into hours of overthinking and I have a possible plan for when to do the call but it’s based around avoiding all my fears and triggers."

somomon,2021-12-14 11:14:21+00:00,M24. Wheelchair bound.,"Sorry in advance this will be a long read. 
I’m 24 almost 25 years old. I wasn’t supposed to live past 24 hours after I was born. I was born missing my L2 vertebrae and had to be laid on my stomach for almost a week til they did the surgery to stitch up my back. In 24 years I’ve had 19 major surgeries on my head, stomach and back. Almost died 9 times from various things having to do with my conditions. At 11 years old after coming severely close to dying due to my brain suffocating the doctors told me and my mother for the first time that my life expectancy doesn’t go past 40. I’m not an optimist. I’m a realist. So if they say 40 I’m expecting to only live til 40. I didn’t expect to make it this far so when I was younger I never planned anything for the future or never really still plan anything now or for the further future I didn’t expect to see or don’t expect to be able to enjoy. All my friends have kids, careers, marriages etc. Seeing how I’m going to be 25 that means in 15 years I’m expecting to be dead. By the timeline I’ve been given I’m way behind in where i should be. I should have more at this age. I should have kids, marriage, house etc. But I know by 25 that’s not realistic. I tried to keep busy between 14-20 and keep my mind off things and I guess forget about what the doctors told me. But after fighting for so long to stay alive and knowing it might as well have been for nothing because it’s not prolonging my life beyond the time span I’ve been given. I’m fucking tired. I’ve been tired for years. I don’t love my life but it’s the only one I get. I’m trying to make the most of every day but there’s only so much energy I have and physical pain I can take from moving. I’m already severely depressed and in pain daily. To avoid being in more pain from moving too much I sit and play video games, watch Netflix etc. I’m lonely but content and happy with what I have. Coming to terms with my situation has killed my drive to do anything. Get a job, have sex, enjoy hobbies or anything really. Everyone views video games as a hobby but in reality for me it’s a temporary escape/distraction from the inevitable. It gives me a sense of accomplishment I’ll never get from landing that big promotion at work or when my child is born. Turning on my game system and wasting the day away playing games or turning on Netflix has become my life. My routine. I hate it. I want more from my life but it just wasn’t in the cards I guess. It makes me happy to see others win and accomplish things I’ll never come close to. Others have the 10-15 years to put into building a business, having a career, raising kids. I don’t. If you take the time to read all of this. Thank you and remember if no one wants to see you win in life. Or accomplish what you want to accomplish. I do. I want you to do everything you’ve ever dreamed of or talked about doing. I. Want. To. See. You. Win. In. Life."
nandupoochi,2021-12-14 11:00:11+00:00,Struggling to keep going on after a break up,"Apologies for the long post. 

Struggling to do anything these days.
I had a breakup recently and I'm finding it hard to focus on anything. We were together for a really short time (~a week). But this was one of my best friends and now I no longer have anyone I feel comfortable talking to.

We both realised we had feelings for each and decided to give it a shot. We decided to take it slow and keep it chill. But I got carried away when he said that I shouldn't not consider going abroad because he would come with me. Now that we've broken up because he needs to figure things out, I can't find the energy to keep going on. I'm sleepy/tired most of the time and have been feeling hungrier than usual. 

It's the uncertainty that's killing me. I can't seem to move on. I think I love him. And I want to wait until he figures things out. But I'm not sure if he'll want to be with me again. And this is triggering all feelings of unworthiness in me. I'm struggling to stay healthy and focused. I lost both my boyfriend and my best friend. It sucks big time. I don't think I can feel the same way when we were in a relationship ever again.

Just wanted to vent. All of this seems like a really stupid reason for me to get depressed. But it's really hard. I miss him so much."

And I still have no motivation 

It’s like I don’t realize there’s some void in me until I have a ten minute period of hope.. I have a realization of “who I am” which really is just who I think I am in the moment. Whenever I think I “found myself” I plan out my life for ten min or so feeling super inspired and motivated and positive 

But besides that I’m lazy as hell.. I can’t do anything and I do have adhd- but I feel like this isn’t adhd. Bc it’s so easily fixed when I’m inspired that life can be better. Even tho I’m happy I don’t realize I’m not."

WilheimBaudelaire,2021-12-14 02:00:08+00:00,Does living on hope ever become worth it?,"I often feel like the present rejects me and forces me to project myself into the future and what I hope of it, I end up living through my imagination and each realisation of my hopes has been beyond disappointing. I wonder if hope is just a coping mechanism we have to compensate for consciousness, because the ability to feel and also perceive and ponder over all the things in the world causes so much pain."
anneboleynfan1,2021-12-14 01:32:03+00:00,Pain,"I am in so much emotional pain. I was depressed and in some pain before this, but two nights ago, my husband told me he was done with me. Now, I can barely keep myself upright. I just want to stay in bed, buried under blankets, with a razor in my hand.
I can’t really be mad at my husband for this. I’ve been mentally checked out for years. I guess because of my depression. I started therapy in the beginning of this year and I’m also on medication and also just started Wellbutrin this morning. I’m praying for this medicine to kick in soon.
He said he’s willing to try couples counseling but only because he thinks he owes it to our kids to try. I want to be with him, but not if he doesn’t want to be with me.
I can’t tell you how much this is killing me. I really don’t know how I’m gonna get through this."

Maybe some tips or methods on how you alleviate your pain or how you distract yourself. What helps you and what is working against it? Do you talk to friends/family or maybe you let it feed itself and hide it until it gets better?
I tend to just not tell it and wait until it is gone because of some trauma and anxiety from showing how I really feel.

People in grade 11 I was so fucking depressed and being in school every day was absolute torture I spent time in class in the corner fighting of tears every day , trying keep my sanity because noise and laughter of the other students drove me crazy inside ; sure I laughed with the other students the facade is heavy but it was worse when I actually enjoyed my day I'd come back home and feel guilty for enjoying my day.

So opening of grade 12 I was absent the first week because I really did not want to be in class again. I lied to my parents about the when schools opened because I knew they wouldn't even listen to me when I said I was tired but I lied and just kept it to myself then teachers at school sent people who knew where I live to get me. So I went to because the jig was up and when I got to school all the students shouted out my name and clapping their hands . I try my best to be a ghost to people yet I'm one of the most well known people in school.

So I got in trouble with the principal I don't hate the guy he meant well. So grade 12 2020 the pressure keeps mounting on me I was reaching a breaking...I was imploding inside I'm depressed and teachers are going pressure and the special attention that they gave always kept me in the spot light I was dying. So I started getting in situations where I almost got into fights with teachers(non physical) I just wanted a breather because I can't even get a break in my own head. Then lockdown came and gave us a 3 month break I must be honest that really helped me because I was a ticking time bomb.

The school resumed after lockdown but it was easier because covid disrupted a lot of programs especially that was given to those special students. Now I was better my grades started picking but year end my results came back not too bad but with the effort I had put in they should've been better. So this year I took a break from school because my results were rejected by all the institutions. Then the school said the department made a mistake in my results and took them a year to rectify.

I finally was free from dealing with people all day but now since my results have been fixed , I have to get back to school next year and dealing with people. I'm sorry my story doesn't make sense I just wanted to rant a bit because I should've killed myself in 2018-2019..."

Even though yesterday and like many days before Ive been in a worse situation than the months before , I couldn't do anything to myself , why is it that my body and my mind is protecting me but It knows I won't be able to manage certain things that are going to happen to me.

secretive_bitch,2021-12-13 13:53:41+00:00,Why am I always a second chick?,"You know I have been in relationships, a decent no. of relationships, but I am always treated like crap. Recently I was in a hookup type thing, and I know there is no attachment and all that, but eventually, the guy started acting all possessive and pretended to love me. Night text, daily calls, even he once sent food to my place(surprise), always tell me his whereabouts and all that. I felt loved like really, but then I see a girl with him. he went to a party and posted a picture w a girl. I've seen the same girl in a few photos too before. 

I know boy and girl can be friends and stuff, but the point is that he never posted any picture with me?

I am beautiful, I shall be treated specially, publically, or at least equally. You can't be all rosy rosy with me when nobody is around and take a 'just friends' attitude publically.  I don't want to sound jealous or something bc I come from a background where-

1-the guy will cheat me

2- my girlfriend gets paired up w my guy

It's not it , there is a long chain of toxicity, abuse, manipulation, and harassment on so many grounds,plus family dynamics is just soooo soo  wrong.

To divert me from my pity-self I get indulge in relationships/hookups and end up breaking my own expectations.

I am just a broken human looking for companionship,

I don't want someone to feel pity for me or bad for me, I need no one to like depend on, I just want somebody you know, just my side.. just be there. 

I barely step out of my room, barely talk to anyone. yeah, I do makeup sometimes, feel pretty then remove it and back to myself. I am scared that I am not a good human, always a disappointment to people, never good really happens. What if I like someone and they go out in the world and see better people than me and just move with them. I am so confused."

I wish that they would just listen to me, hear what I have to say, and tell its going to be okay. But because I can't these thoughts spiral and before long ot gets really dark. 

You tell a friend they worry, you tell a parent and you won't hear the end of it, and if you tell a counselor they will tell the state... so even now in this time period of acceptance depression is still very isolating... and they wonder why it's all too often to late to help people before they commit."

(Mainly management) And it’s so heartbreaking cause I was so immaturely excited to be back tonight after not working yesterday. I’m 24 years old. I feel so foolish.

ImKindaDrowningIRL,2021-12-13 02:42:40+00:00,I don’t know what to do anymore,"I had a session with my therapist and my mom the other day, and afterwards when I talked with my therapist about it, I felt so validated. I wasn’t imagining the manipulation, the gaslighting, the verbal, mental, and emotional abuse. I wasn’t the one who made me broken, or at least it wasn’t entirely my doing. There was someone who saw that this was real, that unlike everyone else, didn’t see me as just another angsty teenager complaining about my parent. And then I walked home after and I sat on the front stoop in the dark and cold hoping I would get sick. And then I scratched my arm until it bled. And now my arm hurts every time it touches something, and i have the sniffles. The tornado didn’t come to New York after all. I’m going to school tomorrow to fail a test and not give in a lab report and get accused for cheating in the one subject I don’t cheat in. What now?

Wh00pity_sc00p,2021-12-13 01:52:18+00:00,Yeah it's all down hill from here,"I just feel like it's too late to turn it all around for me. I'm getting closer to 30 and I know that I'm not going to go back to school, even though I keep telling everyone I am. I suck at learning and I know that I'll never find anything interesting to major in. Everything is just either boring or too hard for my dumb brain to handle. I've changed my major and career choice so many times now and I'm still lost and unhappy. Since I can't find a solid career, I know I'll never be able to land a good job; which means I know I'll never be able to move out of my mom's house. Since I'm going to live at home forever, I know no woman will want to be with me. I mean I don't blame them. What sane woman would want to live with a guy who can't even support himself? 

Even If I did have my own place, I know no woman would want to be with me because I'm ugly. Yeah I know everyone says that they're ugly, but I am actually pretty fucking ugly. I'm short (5'6), I have a fat nose, I have a small/ fragile body frame, I have a lazy eye, a shitty jawline, and I have a rare shitty skin condition that spreads all over my body. I have bad back problems that makes it look weird when I walk or even stand still, and I'm also pretty small down there. 

I also come from a fucked up family filled with abusive family members. I have a hard time socializing and making friends. Like who the fuck would want to be with me? I'm surprised that I haven't turned into a neck beard who hate women. I'm not saying I want to be one; I'm just saying statistically, with the hand I was given in live, I should pretty much be one. 

Anyways, I wasn't supposed to live this long. I'm 28 now and I just don't see it getting any better. I'm probably going to kill myself in 2 years or so. Idk we'll see."

In september i exchanged schools to get a new start and hopefully finally make a friend (obviously didn’t happen lol), but i feel like i keep embarrassing myself you know? my stomach will make super loud noises that i can’t control all the time, i see everyone looking at me like i was some kind of creature and i just don’t know what to do anymore, i think i already ruined my reputation in this school so i might as well change again.. i don’t know, this shit fuckin sucks"

Sad-Selection-6796,2021-12-12 22:08:27+00:00,"Another day, Another rock bottom","I recently got laid off from my job because I had an attitude. I never intentionally gave attitude towards anyone, but I am very irritable and it shows on my face. My sleeping schedule was non existent at this point, I would wake up with anxiety attacks, not be able to sleep due to insomnia, or just ruminate about how fucked up life is in general. 

This new manager came in recently and he's helping to get the store back in shape(a somewhat fancy fast-food place). I knew him for two days and on the second day he asked to talk to me. I saw him sitting down with people the day before and throughout the day. I wondered what he was talking about with them. We sat down and he asked me ""who's insert anonymous name"". I was suprised by his question and I honestly didn't want to answer it. I didn't just want to give out any information. So I giggled nervously and asked specifically what? He said ""whatever"". Oh hell no I was not about to reveal any personal  information. So I told him ""Well I need you to ask me something more specific"". I dont remember how our conversation went, but he told me that I had an ""attitude"". I got a little mad because i try my best to show my best front. I drank energy drinks just to get me through atleast 8 hours(I worked 10a.m-9:30a.m). He proceeded to ask me what was going on home and told me he could tell i had a lonely childhood ect, ect. I started getting really anxious and was ripping the plastic gloves i had on hand. He took them away from me and tried to get me to talk. But i felt like I needed to do something before i exploded. I felt like I was close to being triggered and throwing a fit. I could feel my heart racing. I started to get furious at him for thinking he had a right to know. He told me that he's been through a lot of the same conversations as well and that the job requires it. I forgot what else i said, but i some point i was shaking and as i watched my thumb shake vigourously i jumped. He asked if i was okay, but I decided to ignore him. I didnt want my feelings to burst. So i looked to the right and tried my best to calm myself down. He tried to talk to me but i just ignored him. I didnt care at this point. I wasnt going to talk to him.

Even if I wanted to talk to someone, i couldnt just trust someone i knew for two days. Now thinking about it, word wouldve gotten out what happened to me just like it happened to a coworker. I wanted to leave my past life behind and start fresh somewhere. 
Even though my mental health was at its worst i showed improvement and was now doing okay at work. Its embarrassing to have mental health at its worst and have no one understand. People think your the worst, but i was fighting a war in my mind that seeped out in what looked like tantrums. I bottled up my emotions until it could no longer hold and was spilling. 

Anyway i got fired the next day for not cooperating with the new manager. 

Now i feel absolutely hopeless, i dont even care to try and pick my self up again. Im tired of that routine. Im just ruminating in my room, bingeing shows, eating junk food, then just going out whenever invited. Im kind of just letting the current of the universe to continue pushing me until eventually I land on another opportunity. But for now i dont care anymore. 

Comment anything:) 
Any tips, advice, constructive criticism, id like to hear your thought"
absolute_apple375,2021-12-12 21:28:46+00:00,Feels like I’m getting nowhere,"I’m 24 and almost 2 years out of college. I live in the same tiny apartment I lived in as a college senior, with my boyfriend &amp; our dog.

This time of the year is hell for me. Due to childhood emotional abuse, 5 years ago I developed OCD. It makes me terrified to see my family, in fear of being “contaminated” by them/their abusive traits. I have deep depression as a co-symptom of my OCD.

I work a stressful low-paying job, just enough to cover rent, while my boyfriend finishes grad school. Due to us both being sad and miserable all the time, our tiny apartment is always messy.

The only benefit is that we have each other &amp; our dog, who is as happy/healthy as can be. I just wish the same could be said for us.
I’ve applied for 200+ jobs, made it past a few interviews, but it never works out. 
If I could get a job that pays a decent salary, we could afford a better apartment, therapy for me, and I could save for a car.

It’s so hard to keep afloat and feel like things will get better. If anyone else out there has ever felt similarly, been in a similar situation….. please tell me. I feel so hopeless"

genderless_wolf,2021-12-12 16:07:19+00:00,I dont know what to do,So I've been depressed for the past 1-2 years and I've recently talked to my mom about this she told me that she wants me to only use my phone when I need to talk to somebody she says it will help me but Im hella addicted to it and I stay like 7-8 hours a day on it because I don't have the energy to do anything else and my mom doesn't understand that I can't do this I recently started knitting and I try to reduce the time but I just can't go from 7-8 hours a day to almost none and idk what to do

I hope I will love and will be love ardently. I want to live. I want to be happy but what I am now is alone, unloved and unwelcomed.
I hope things get better 
I hope I'll get better
I hope I'll live a life
Hope is the only thing I have right now and I will hope that one day all of the things I hope I become will come true
I might be lonely and depressive right now, but I want to be stronger so I could see myself someday be better."
ContributionFun6491,2021-12-12 15:42:25+00:00,Can't afford to live anywhere- really just want to fucking die more and more everyday,"Warning I'm going to be swearing alot in this post because this world gets me heated.


The world is super fucking annoying. I literally grew up watching people bag groceries(no hate toward anyone bagging groceries) and we're able to afford a house, a car and raised 3 children.

Here I am in the year 2021 I work in infection control during a fucking pandemic and I can't find an affordable apartment within an hour and a half of where I work. 

It's fucking bullshit. I constantly deny myself, I constantly donate money to help the needy and I look at all these self centered people around me who haven't even worked in the past 2 years living the life they always wanted.

I work a bunch of overtime and go out of my way to do a good job at work. I don't know why TF the world is designed to reward assholes who want to drink their own life away and the people who genuinely work hard and stay away from all the nonsensical shit in the world get sucked time and time again.

Fuck this place"

newleedepressed,2021-12-12 14:44:49+00:00,Severe depression due to traumatic injury / sexual dysfunction,"I'm 31 and if I can rewind time to 2020 or before, life was going so good and I didn't realise it. Depression started 6 months ago after I did a leg press at the gym and felt a sharp pain in my penis. Since then I've had ED that no pill can fix and my penis has completely changed shape. I can't even look at it anymore. When I ejaculate barely anything comes out. Doctors are unable to help me. I spent a lot of money seeing urologists, nobody knows what happened. 

I probably will never have a girlfriend, wife or kid. I don't know what to do. I haven't told anybody about this. I want to tell my father but I worry that it will depress him also. My family have noticed that I barely talk or see them anymore this past year. If I am at my parents, I just stay in a room and never leave. 

All this stress is probably making my condition worse, but I can't not think about it. I'm so lost. Shattered."
BornInTheUSSA,2021-12-12 14:35:05+00:00,I feel like I can’t shake it anymore.,"I’ve always had outs. Music. Friends. Movies. Stories. Exercise. Good food.

Nothing seems to work anymore. Something is different, and it’s not me. I usually look inward to solve my problems, but something is wrong with people. It seems like people are becoming nastier, more merciless, more foolish, hypocritical. I can’t people to admit when they’re wrong about anything without it turning into a fight.

People can’t argue. They don’t know the difference between disagreeing about something and being personally attacked, and it’s killing me. Being educated has become a curse. Nobody cares about the truth. They only care about their feelings and their opinions. The middle ground has been lost everywhere I look.

Where is compassion? Where is forgiveness? Where is humility? I can’t find it.

Every day has become a walk on egg shells. People drive land act like criminals and sociopaths everywhere I look.

Something is wrong with people. It’s never been more miserable to be a human being."

dayanero,2021-12-12 06:54:35+00:00,I need ur opinion,"So i have this coworker that i hired nearly 2 years ago. Shes 24 and im 30 so theres a gap. Anyway, we were really good friends the first year. I taught her everything about the job. I even taught her things that dont pertain to her job position just so she can have more experience on her resume. We shared secrets, met her daughter, and would go shopping together on our lunch breaks.We would also carpool together to work everyday. I paid for gas occasionally but i would always buy her starbucks every morning. I got her a raise, and got her promoted. We had tons in common. So yeah i thought we were friends. Not best friends, but more than just coworkers. 

So occasionally she would vent to me about her best friend. She has known her since middle school. Lets call her Lisa. She would say that Lisa is a jealous person and didnt like her having any other friends except for her. Lisa would be upset if she caught her best friend talking to any other friend. She would stay at her house all day and night, help her with her daughter and leave as soon as my friends boyfriend came home.  (Lisa and the boyfriend do not get along. They do not speak to each other. )She would tell me Lisa is rude to customer service employees and it embarrasses her. That she always had to help her with money. 

So once my friend got her promotion, we needed someone to take her old position. She suggested Lisa for the job. Being that its a customer service position, i had my reservations but i didnt oblige. I had met her only one other time before this and she seemed ok. So we hired her.

For the first 2 weeks, everything was normal. I was learning alot about Lisa. She had a temper. She would always talk down to her best friend infront of anyone who was around, over the littlest things. She called her lots of bad words. I get that we all have friendships like that, where we call each other things but she would say it angrily. My friend would play it off like it was no big deal, but honestly it was pretty horrendous to hear someone spoken to that way. But i felt that if shes ok with it, than i should be too. Theyre best friends and this is their friendship. 

Lisa would call her best friends daughter her daughter. Which is funny to hear the first time, but as i got to know her, she would always talk about that child like that really was her child. It was kinda creepy, but again, none of my business.  

So around the third week, they both asked me if my boss likes them. I told them he does as far as i know, Ive never heard him complain about them and thats the honest truth. We went on our lunch break together that day and my boss sent them both an email that he wanted to talk to them. They asked me what its about. I told them i have no clue, because i really didnt. Well, once we got back from our lunch break, my boss talked to them about how are they behind on work when they have all this overtime. Not sure what was said in that meeting , but after that they started treating me different. 

When they would pick me up for work, i would talk to them and they would both ignore me. And if they did acknowledge something i said, they would both look annoyed , confused or even disgruntled. It was getting really awkward. So i told them i was going to start going to work on my own, no more carpool with them. They said thats fine. After that, they asked me if i wanted to go to lunch with them once and i told them i was going to stay in. (It felt like they only invited me just so i can tell them no, so that way they can say it was me who stopped talking to them) Then they stopped talking to me completely.  I was a little hurt but not completely bummed because i knew i didnt do anything. I still had love for them, no hard feelings ya know?

8 months later:

The girls stopped talking to each other. Everyone in the building had noticed and wondered what went wrong. I had no clue, nor did i care, i just stayed out of it. 

Well, my old friend decided to start talking to me again. I told her it made me sad to see her and Lisa fighting. She told me Lisa decided she didnt want to be her friend anymore. I adviced her to go make up with her and she said she cant. 

So i took her back...we would hang out like before and even started carpooling again. Occasionally she would bring up Lisa and tell me little facts about her. She would tell me that Lisa is the kind of person who thought any female that would look at her boyfriend was trying take him from her and that it bothers her that Lisa always calls her daughter, HER daughter. I made no comments, just said wow!  

Coincidentally, Lisa started acknowledging my existitance again. We had to interact due to work, so i got to know her more. On one occasion, we went to the store. When we were getting out of her car, she opened her car door really fast and hit the car next to hers and just laughed. She didnt apologize or anything. She thought she was being funny. She left a big scratch on the other persons car. We went to the store and i finally witnessed how horrible she is to customer service employees. It was embarrassing and completely unnecessary. She then tells me shes scared of Asian people. 

So one of my bosses asked Lisa why they werent talking anymore and she told our boss that my friend stopped talking to her because Lisa went to Disneyland without her and took some other friend! I laughed so hard. Why would anyone be upset over that? I never confronted my friend about what i heard, it seemed so absurd. I stayed out of it. 

Well, as time went on, my friend would bring up Lisa and say they started texting each other. I said thats cool. She would then proceed to try to show me their text messages. I was a little taken aback. I didnt understand why she felt the need to try and show me their conversations. I always declined to read them because a) thats weird b) i dont really care who shes friends with, its her life and c) its none of my business. At the same time, i didnt understand why she would want someone like that back into her life. My friend would tell me how shes so happy that she can talk to all her other friends now without hiding it from Lisa. She felt free to post pictures online of her and her other friends without getting backlash from Lisa for it. So i didnt understand,  but its her life ya know?

So 1 day before they became best friends again, my friend asked me if our boss has told me anything about her. I told her no , because he didnt, i dont talk to him like that. She then went back to Lisa the next day and they both started giving me the cold shoulder again. It happened exactly like last time. I cut it off with them because they were acting weird again.  This time it hurt. It hurt really bad. My friend just shunned me out. I felt used. I feel like she only became my friend again because she wanted to make Lisa jealous.  She wanted to find out why my boss wasnt crazy about her and i didnt give no insight. She used me, for the second time! I was mad at her at first and now im mad at myself for taking her back. They flaunt their friendship infront of me everyday. It makes me feel so stupid for ever hiring them. Now everyday that i go to work i have to face them. When i walk by they whisper to each other and start laughing. They both make negative comments loud enough for me to hear about things im interested in just to get a reaction out of me. Its been like that for 2 months now. I dislike work when i get downtime now because then i have to deal with this anger inside of me. Theyre work station is next to mine and there are no ceilings so i can hear everything.  They dont do anything directly to me , so theres nothing to complain to HR about. 

I want to quit my job. I absolutely love my job. And i hate that im planning on leaving because of them. Its not fair. Its really messing with my mental health. I dont know how to deal with this...pls help. The whole situation is soo sooo stupid and i hate that im affected by this. I need to know what to do for this to stop bothering me. I want to move on. It interrupts my inner peace. Please advice. Im a happy person, but ive been so down lately..."

pegster999,2021-12-12 03:52:00+00:00,Injury making my depression so much worse,I’ve been struggling a lot with anxiety and depression for a while now. A week ago I fell and broke my elbow. I know many people break bones and survive. I’m a widowed mom to 2 teenagers with severe autism and also help out my 80 year old mom with what she needs. I don’t have any help. I’m also out of work due to this. In some ways this is nice because I really don’t like the job but the loss of income is very stressful. They won’t let me back to work until I have no restrictions. I can’t DoorDash either because I’m just not up to it. I can’t do a lot that I normally do for my mom. I can’t visit my oldest son who lives in a group home due to the drive. I feel so alone and useless. Christmas is a wash because I can’t get the tree up and being out of work means no money for gifts . I spent most of today in bed. I have no energy or motivation to do anything. I’m in pain. My migraines have increased due to stress. I’m having suicidal thoughts. My family needs me but it’s so hard right now. This injury has made it so much harder.
sexynuggetwithboobs,2021-12-12 02:42:42+00:00,Some thoughts,"I don't know where my depression started, I remember I was a teenager who went everywhere and now I'm an anxious adult who goes grocery shopping in the late afternoon when there are very few people around. 
I remember it all started because I was crying a lot, for every problem and I couldn't count on anyone. I have no faith in myself, I'm not good at anything and I always screw up everything, which give me some anxiety. I feel useless and I suck. I wonder ""what am I doing in the world if I'm useless?"" I think that the various problems of low self-confidence also come from my family, there was a climate of violence and constant toxic communication, even today they try to make me feel guilty because I am trying to keep my distance. As an adult I can't do much, I work and get drunk on weekends because I want to forget the whole week. And getting drunk it's not cool, cause most of the time I end up drunk and sad or crying. Everything make you feel like you have no place in this world, that you exist by mystake."
L0VINGD3AD,2021-12-12 02:28:05+00:00,Excerpt,"people obligatorily ask how I am? 

my reply, 

I am in between tragedies at the moment, couch surfing betrayals, living hand to mouth on pain. high on hope I drunkenly stagger from one hell to the next. though through the intoxicated babble all that can be heard is,

""I'm fine""."
nostalgia_ridden,2021-12-12 02:27:25+00:00,I suppose this is just a status update to record myself and my thoughts,"I don't know where to start? It's been quite a while since I've written anything on here. But I suppose I've gotten a bit better. I still think about suicide and hurting myself and struggle with self-esteem and self-worth, but I suppose they haven't been bothering me as intensely as usual?  
I still think of them, and the thoughts continue to pop in like a check-in to make sure I'm not completely happy, but I've managed to brush them off for a bit by concentrating on my work and having less time to ruminate too deeply on those things.  
I suppose this is avoidance, but honestly, this is so much better than when I was completely trapped at home.   
There are still some days where I contemplate existing at all, or whether I should just drive into a wall on the freeway, but then I remember how it would be putting other drivers at risk and how expensive the car is. In fact, I could say that that car is worth more than me. So I stop and think about it and decide not to risk others or damage the car.  
Every day I walk to one of my classes, I have to cross the train tracks. I think about just standing on the rails and letting the train come and hit me. But I take a pause and don't do it because I don't want to traumatize other people.

I think about taking a swan dive off the top floor of the tallest buildings in my school, but then I realize that I don't want to traumatize others and that a fall from that height wouldn't cause my death if I didn't land right and would just leave me as a paraplegic and hating life more than I already do. And in that case, I wouldn't even have the choice to actually pick when I want to die. So I stop myself.  
I've been finding comfort in these thoughts for a while. I've been stopping myself because I don't want to inconvenience others, and I have also found a warped sense of comfort in hearing these thoughts come to me. It's a familiar feeling. It's less stressful compared to things happening in the external world.  
I find that as winter comes, hearing from my friends more often and looking forward to seeing them as well as what the holidays bring is also helping uplift my spirits. Talking to my friends over text is always a relief. Any strong impulse beyond the daily intrusive thoughts doesn't seem to matter as much anymore when my friends are coming back soon.   
Distracting myself with work, school, food, and reading anything I can get my hands on help the intrusive thoughts more infrequent. Being able to be alone and listening to music while driving the car alone I attribute to this increase in mental health (though, once again, I suppose this isn't an improvement but rather simple avoidance tactics).  
Nowadays, I get much more easily emotional (of course only for myself to see), and honestly, I'd compare myself to a dog excited for a drive, because that is how I feel whenever I get to drive myself alone to places I have to go.  
In fact, the other day, I was able to go shopping for groceries by myself without anyone else, and I took my time. It was one of the greatest feelings I've ever had. Even when I was alone and the intrusive thoughts came, I just found it to be so much more peaceful. Kind of pathetic but what makes me feel calmer and more peaceful is what it is.   
I do still get intense bouts of when I just feel like leaving the living world, but I guess that has been less frequent compared to the passive thoughts and I think that's a plus."

It been months now and I burn every temp job I had and now I'm going back to school and tryna to change my life. I'm angry I started fights with her. But I'm hurt and broken and life been hard to me and I'm in pain. Inside I'm always hurting. And I do my best for her. I always gave her my paycheck so she could buy herself food and whatever. She went back to PA and is gonna change her life. I'm still in NC and I'm worse than ever. I'm drinking more, taken sleeping pills and have sex with anyone And I mean anyone! I haven't told her. I can't I need her to know I'm okay but honestly I'm sick and I'm hate myself but she can never know this. I maybe not finish school. Idk. I'm messed up but as long she's doing okay I'm okay.

sadbaby23,2021-12-11 23:35:46+00:00,Congrats,"Today I finished and passed my Phlebotomy course at my college. I earned a certificate of completion and was super stoked. I got home and the one person I was hoping would congratulate me, said nothing. He didn't even acknowledge that I had just passed my class. I tried hinting that I passed and wanted to celebrate but all he said in response was ""mhm. Okay."" 

I finally flat out told him I was upset that he never said anything to congratulate me, and his response was ""what do you want me to do? Kiss your feet or something?"" As if I was asking him to worship me for passing my course.

It was so condescending and cold. My heart hurts so bad right now. It might be petty, but this was the first time in months I actually felt genuinely happy, and it was destroyed in a matter of seconds. Now I feel nothing, and no longer feel like celebrating. Just feels like another shitty day of my life."

unearthly_hen,2021-12-11 18:16:42+00:00,Am I depressed or does my life just suck?,"Im tired of existing. Nothing feels like its worth it anymore. I started therapy two months ago in secret but I dont tknow if its helping me much simply because I think feeling numb and aweful is how I am supposed to feel considering the situation. I have brain cancer, I wish I were born a female but I can never transition (im trying my best to repress and I keep all this a secret from my parents, they would loose their minds), my parents that I live with control almost every aspect of my life. I simultanously rely on my parents for survival but they will never let me move out, and I am pretty sure my parents want to do an arranged marriage or something soon (my parents are indian and I was born here in the US). I just dont know why I keep going, it feels like my life and body are rotting and I am supposed to be dead already. Im 24 but it seems like all my peers are trying to live their best lives and work on their careers, but all I am concerned about is base survival. All I can seem to do is disapoint my parents and suffer.

I donr feel sad or anything, I just feel like I need to be numb or dead. Everything feels hopeless, even when obstensibly good things happen like getting a job, I just dont feel good about it, all I get it more work and exhaustion, I dont care about money or having anything in life. Im just trying to avoid pain but it seems the best way to do that is suicide.

Im just so exhausted but I am not supposed to be. Nothing feels worthwhile, nothing seems to make me truly happy, I can sort of get hints of happy but not the whole thing if it makes sense, I have felt this way for years now and now everything feels like a flat line.

Im not sure what to do. i think I will quit therapy, its expensive and if my life is shit maybe im supposed to feel like shit."

mlkmstch,2021-12-11 08:36:55+00:00,"I feel trapped, with no one to turn to","I'm not usually this guy, this is quite embarrassing for me, but I just need to be heard. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was young so I'm no stranger to being depressed. But I feel like I'm at an all time low and I don't know what to do anymore. 

It's about to get ranty, so bear with me.

After a 6 year relationship and two kids, me and my wife split up last year. It took me finally leaving to realize how manipulative and controlling she was. It's been over a year of separation and I still feel like she has control over my life. She turned everyone against me, including my own dad and stepmom after we split, telling them lies of me cheating and being abusive. I was so good to this woman it makes me sick. I know I'm not perfect and made my fair share of mistakes, but I tried my best to make her feel loved and cared for. Everyone believed her and now I sit alone in my quiet house as she daily drains me of my energy  and money. I have no friends or family anymore.

 She won't let me see my 1 year old daughter for more then an hour a week, but let's me take my 4 year old son every day I have off of work because he's ""too much for her"". I feel as though my son is probably mistreated or ignored by her, but I feel helpless because he doesn't have marks on his skin. She has been putting off finalizing the divorce, as all she has to do is send me the paperwork to sign, but it feels like she's either planning something or just fucking with me. Or she knows she will have to let me have my baby, and she's not willing to do that. We split right before my daughter was born and I wasn't even made aware of her birth until two days after. She's been shady about my daughter the whole time. And not to toot my own horn but I'm a good dad! I've never done anything to harm those kids and she knows that. But she treats and punishes me like I'm not a good father and it really fucks with my head.

I'm stuck at a dead end job that doesn't pay enough. But I have no schooling or useful skills to do better for myself. 

I have a deep desire to just feel loved and thought of. I feel like I'm a decent person, and I've never really hurt anybody. I try to spread love to people because I want to believe in karma but I never get love back. It feels like I could disappear and none would be the wiser except for maybe my son. I am constantly wanting to just end it, but he's the only thing keeping me here. I have twisted thoughts of my wife running away with the kids so that I can just end it. That scares the fuck out of me. I want to not only be alive for my son and daughter, but I want to be happy and helpful towards them and not create just more depressive kids like everyone else in my fucked family. I don't want them to be like me.

I feel so alone and helpless. I just want to feel loved and important to someone.

Thanks for taking the time to read, sorry if it's melodramatic but I'm a melodramatic person when I'm in this head space."

RedditUser054,2021-12-11 07:17:43+00:00,How do I cope with my mom in a healthy way?,"My mom is very depressed. She doesn't get along with her sisters/brother/mom and my older sister cut her off completely. It hurts because I love her so much and I wish the other family would too, but on the other hand, she is very needy emotionally and gets hurt easily. She consistently cries about how they don't love her or understand her. My sister is visiting for christmas, but she is visiting her husband's parents and not our mom. This crushes my mom. 
My mom first married a man who abused/beat her (this is the man she had my sister with) then she left him. Then she met my dad and they separated a few years ago because he admitted he's gay and he's addicted to crystal meth. Then she got another boyfriend and they broke up. Then she married a guy who she only knew for 3 months. Now they are separating and she once again has another boyfriend. Now, the first 2 men were not her fault, but the rest I give her full blame. All the crummy men i've had to deal with up to now, I blame her for. So even I am angry at her for a lot of things and feel like she cares more about her love life than me. 

So how do I deal with this situation in a way where I don't carry her problems on my shoulders or get hurt but also support her as much as I can? I'm 16 so I still have a lot to do with her."

Haven't even attended anyyyyyy sorts of mcq mock tests other than the name sake of pre boards were given the most shittiest qp that anyone could find. You guys gave me severe depression. Already i was depressed cuz of corona and online clases. On top of that your immature stunt of providing these qps. Now am mentally on the verge of breaking up. Idk about everyone.

i've never really shared my problems with anyone not irl nor on internet, i did sometimes and ended up feeling like a burden.

I don't know , i'm always clumsy i mess up every single thing i always feel insecure, i'm scared to go out in public and face people because everytime i see someone looking at me,i feel like deep down there they are judging my appearance so i try to hide my face, when i'm with my ""friends"" who only use me or my cousins i always feel insecure, they all are stunning and flawless but me..

I see the good in everyone except for me, i wouldn't have shared my problems here but i just am tired of crying and my head hurts and i don't know i feel weak, lately i haven't been taking care of myself, eating drinking or anything. Life's been hard. i'm a professional at showing people i'm happy cuz i know i'd be called dramatic if i do the opposite, so i just fake my happiness and everyone literally thinks im the most happiest human being to ever exist.

Yesterday night made me feel even worse, i always have these mental breakdowns atleast once in a day and sometimes it lasts a little sometimes it just doesn't go away, at this point i just feel like grabbing a knife and stabbing myself because i'm just a mess and a burden in everyone's life, and i know i'm an ""extra"" and while i'm gone, it wouldn't really make a dfiference except for my dead body occupying some space on this earth. but i have my dream life and so much more goals which are now fucking hard to achieve cuz of all this, i don't know my dream life is the only reason i wanted to livee but not anymore cuz this is literal shit and i'm so tired of pretending."

I have up my bed for those people and got nothing in return. I mean I got nothing!! I'm here single. And alone and laying in my bed writing this right now. I am doomed. And I'm fine with that. I got no thank you from anybody. They don't even acknowledge me anymore cause I've gone gave them everything! I've had and owned. What I got. Not even a f u. My life is completely shit now. Completely shit... What do I do now!?? What is there for me.. I don't know. Hell if I died who care, I'm alive... And nobody cares. So I can't died and I'm living and nobody cares! Nobody. So yeah I hate myself so goddamn much."
ContributionFun6491,2021-12-10 01:23:17+00:00,I'm depressed and i really don't want to be happy,"Sounds bizarre but when I do find myself a little happy I feel weird. It's an uncomfortable feeling. I have been depressed for so long that being happy is a pipe dream. I will never be truly happy.

Everyone in life has always rejected me. I think outside the box, I challenge authority, I question the ""discoveries"" mankind has made throughout history because propaganda exists and history is written by the victors. It's impossible for me to trust anyone because my own family has institutionalized me twice.

Gangs, political parties and greedy corporations and elites run the world and make billions selling the public a fake bill of goods and made up nonsense daily. 

This leaves me feeling worthless and no medication, injection, talk therapy or friendship will ever change that. The world can't tolerate people like me because the questions I ask and the truths I seek constantly literally break apart the fabric of reality for alot of people and it makes them feel uncomfortable.

It really is a lonely feeling being outside of the matrix. I'm not claiming to be superior in anyway. It all just makes me realize that I really am alone in the world and i won't ever feel happy. Wondering if anyone else feels the same way."
Yodarules2,2021-12-09 23:43:56+00:00,DpDr is a living hell sometimes,"I’m feeling better now, before I say anything else. But the last 2 weeks have been really tough on me, I don’t mean to just dump all my shit on social media but I can’t talk to anyone about this and its eating me up inside.

I have a thing called Derealization/Depersonalization, dunno if anyone here knows about it but it sucks. To give a quick and shitty explanation for it, it’s the feeling of either being detached from your body or being detached from the world around you. I’ve got both and for me its a 24/7, all the time, every second of every minute of every day of the past 7 years of my life. I wanna go into more detail but thats the thing about it, nobody can even get an idea of what it feels like unless you’ve experienced it yourself. And thats a huge struggle for me, being alone in this. I know there’s the dpdr subreddit and shit but no one in my family can comprehend the way I feel, its like there aren’t the right words in the world to describe how it feels.

Last week the DpDr got much worse, I started to think the world wasn’t real as if everything was a dream. I’ve always had this sensation that the world felt fake but it’s never gotten to this degree to where I genuinely thought and felt the world was a dream, I felt like my mind was soup and my body was wrapped in cotton.

After that I just felt severely depressed, I’ve always had that thought of ending my life and making the feeling stop but I had stuff that was holding me back from committing. But that week I just felt like nothing mattered anymore, I can’t live like this anymore. I read that a man with dpdr had it for 60 something years of his life, 60 years is a huge number especially when I’ve only been through just 7. I just felt like I needed a way out but there was really only one option for me, so I picked a method and grabbed an exact o knife and went to my room. But I didn’t do it, I sat there for a long while and I didn’t do anything but think. Am I happy that I didn’t do it? I’m not sure, I don’t think I can build up the courage to do it again.

I can’t tell anyone about it, the last 2 times I told my family that I wanted to end it I just got negative feedback. The first time my mom called the cops and the second time she just said I shouldn’t be thinking this way and just made me feel like shit. I want to talk to my therapist about it but I’m afraid Ill go back to the hospital for a week again. So I just gotta bottle it up and keep it to myself, as of now I’ve been distracting myself (kinda) by writing down all my mental stuff and just trying to organize everything. The DpDr tends to screw with your brain a bit so its difficult to keep track of everything going on, so writing it all down feels like i’m getting answers in a way even though i’m not.

This is more of to clear my mind than anything else type of post, I’ve been having a rough two weeks and I needed to just unload somewhere. I tried to reach out to my only friend (who deals with depression) but he’s been distant for the last few months and I can’t seem to get a hold of him.

Anyways, peace"

Spacetalks3114,2021-12-09 16:21:06+00:00,A leopard can change its spots.,"It took me a while to realize that.

You see, I use to believe I was a bad person, because like many of us, I made awful choices. And those choices were beyond moral and really hurt others. In short, I was selfish. And because I was selfish, I believed I was a monster.

But now I know, that person, that being leopard, doesn't have to be a bad thing.

I do have spots, and those spots will always be on my fur, but rather than seeing them as a reminder of who I am, I now see them as the person of who I was and the person I do not want to be.

For all my fellow leopards out there, you will always have spots (things you did bad in your past) but you can change your spots by looking at them for what they are. Just a part of your crazy story. You don't have to be your spots or let your spots define you.

I was with a man a long time ago. He hurt me so much. He abused me, he treated me horribly, made me feel like I was worthless, but even he, (although I would personally never befriend him again) changed. He is actively supporting his community, apologized to me, and seems to have become a better person from multiple accounts of reliable friends.

At first that bothered me because I believed he should suffer because he hurt me. But he did what I didn't think was even possible, he changed his spots. If this man can change, a former thief, drug user, abuser, etc. I think anyone can change.

Now disclaimer: I'm not saying everyone will change. Because oftentimes they won't, this post isn't a ticket for you to let someone abuse you. But I do believe everyone who wants to change can change.

In short, a leopard can change its spots but they have to want to."
Salt-Emu3863,2021-12-09 13:48:20+00:00,not being able to kill yourself sucks,"i already regurgitated  those words a lot, be it irl on online, guess i just need to get it out every so often.

i hate being alive for reasons that i can't just ""fix"", lots of problems with me that i won't really get into right now but i really do hate having to exist as a whole.

i've tried to end it through various means, couldn't go through most of my attempts, the survival instinct is a bitch and a half; then there my intolerance to pain and how uncomfortable various ""ends"" are.

even the one time i managed to push through all of this, gobbling up an ungodly ammount of pills (more than 125 pills of some serious sleeping meds), getting drunk before hand to make sure it works better despite hating the taste of alcohol, i still survived.

as if this one miracle wasn't enough on it's own there was two more, i basically took no brain damage from it (some memory issues for a month or two and a lot of stuff i don't remember from that time). also there was NO TRACE of alcohol in my blood test results, i know i drank, it's part of the stuff i remember and it's what allowed me to tell my survival instinct to fuck off enough to take everything i did.

of course i don't mind the lack of consequences for my actions, even managed to avoid being sent to some horrible mental prison cause i don't think ""the right way"" (mental asylums, never again.). but i'm still here, alive and well so to speak, i hate it and i'm tired of existing. i just want to vanish into nothingness, life as it is isn't fun.

i'm lucky to have good peoples around me, i don't lack love, care, even money. i can spend my days pretty much like a want, i am extremly lucky and i'm grateful for what i do have but no matter what, i, as i am right now won't ever have the chance to be happy and fulfilled. i just know and accept it so just let me actually die and vanish, not be mentally killed until someone that isn't me replace me in my body, making me some sort of memory ghost trapped in my own body methaphorically speaking, not sure how many will get what i'm trying to say here.

i'm tired of it all. if you see life as a game then i'm just an npc being strung along by all the programing, i don't like being an npc, some peoples don't mind, some even like it but i don't, i don't want to play anymore, i don't like being forced to ""play"" this one game with no quit button but my consent isn't required because i'm just an npc and i desperately want out of it all because of it. i want to be a player, not bound by all those soft and hardcoded rules, having creative mode, being sure that any restriction there is on me is my choice, not something forced on me by the game of life. this game isn't fun but it's obviously not my game. &lt;still a metaphore

if someone read through all of this then thanks, maybe drop a message or something, i could use a talk right now"
VeryMentallyStable,2021-12-09 13:09:04+00:00,I really don’t understand how people are happy being alive,"I got asked in therapy last week what I’d do if I had all the time and money in the world. I honestly didn’t have an answer. I have no idea what I’d do. I guess nothing would really change. I guess it’s just kinda a weird realisation to come to that even if I could afford to move away from my shitty family, even if I didn’t have to worry about being able to afford rent or food or didn’t have to go to work, that nothing would really be any better for me. My therapist is convinced if I was living on my own, things would be better. But I’ve lived in my own before, for almost two years and things weren’t better. 

I guess I’m just realising that I don’t think it matters what my external circumstances are, I’m just not really content with being alive at all. If I had all the money in the world, what would I do with it? I can’t think of anything I’d care enough about to spend it on. Guess I’d just give it away but charity doesn’t really do anything for me either. If I had all the time in the world, I’d probably just follow the occasional whim I get to do something like play guitar or watch a movie or make something like I do now, until my interest in doing that thing quickly waned like it always does and I’d be back not knowing what the fuck it is I even want to do, just waiting out each day because I guess I’m just expected to keep existing. 

I’ve heard people say shit like “enjoy the little things” but I don’t. I don’t really know how. I can’t just flip a switch and start enjoying things I really don’t give a fuck about. I’ve also heard the whole “you just haven’t found your thing yet” or “you’ve gotta try new things”, and I have, I basically try any hobby I have even a passing interest in and have been doing that for a while but I just get so bored of everything so quickly. I used think maybe I’d be one of those people who found fulfilment in their work, but I’ve had enough jobs now that I kinda doubt that’s ever gonna be true. Used to think that it was a relationship or something I was waiting for but then I actually started trying to date and realised there’s really no part of human interaction that I actually enjoy all that much. Thought maybe I’d get fulfilment from creative stuff but I don’t ever have the motivation to create anything and when I finally do, I don’t get any satisfaction from it at all and I really have no desire to put it out into the world. 

I just don’t care about anything. Nothing makes me feel happy or excited or really anything at all and I don’t really know how you’re just supposed to wake up every day and just be happy with the fact that you’re just kinda waiting out the clock and honestly dreading the idea of having to do this for potentially another 60+ years."
Vere-D-Lee,2021-12-09 12:20:17+00:00,The Sober Truth (poem),"Truth off my chest

The rest could rest in place

I am like an Ace

But the real Joeka I be

Pick from ""The Giving Tree""

Use me until you don't need me

Life is not easy 

There's is no pleasing me

For a devil I be

The fruit I bear

I would be scared to eat

Where was mercy when I needed it

Who was there to believe in me? 

The sky is the limit

But my heart is infinitely deep

I'm rambling on as my mind struggles to think

I need a break, but I can't escape reality

Not today at least"

I just feel so... Tired. 80% of the time I'm at work, 10% of the time I'm doing chores and the last 10% I can do whatever I want. Which just ends up with me taking a nap anyway.

This just feels so... Redundant. Useless. Pointless. Repetitive."

I downloaded juli and kept with for like a week. Don’t think I’ll keep going with it but we’ll see in the near future. Other than that my mental health has been on the rise. Got a new job, working a full time 9-5 warehouse job, self image and self esteem has gotten much better. Apart from seasonal depression and the usual depressive episodes everything’s been great. Almost everything, the only thing I’ve been looking for is companionship. Someone to share my daily life with, a significant other to say the least. But that’s about it so far. Maybe more to come.

Work, and the gym, and the occasional time off to reflect . When I’m alone with just my thoughts they eat at me. The thoughts of a loss that I had in my life that left a crater in my heart. A void, a feeling of what do I do?! I’m not cheery, I’m not thankful for anything.  Im not religious, far from it. I’m looking for that silver lining, and it’s just not there. I don’t rain on others parade during this season. I just needed to get this out into the universe. The holidays freaking suck.

Crystallix2,2021-12-09 04:34:11+00:00,Feeling is hard,"Joy is fleeting 
Sadness is setting in
Tears flow
I have no emotions 
No one notices 
The only purpose is the puppies. 
They need me
They are beautiful 
Everything else is bland meaningless 
I yearn to just rest 
Life is hard
I just want to rest
Why is everything so heavy?
I don’t know what I want
For the pain to stop 
For them to come back
They’re gone forever 
They died in my hands
They never had a chance 
The pain with Honey is real
The love with Pumpkin is real
Which is worse? 
Which is better?
To feel both the love and pain
Would it better to never feel either?
I feel plastic 
Not real
They are so beautiful and innocent 
I can’t help but love them
They need me like they need their mama
She loves them so much
I love their smell 
I love their squeaks. 
They make me feel. 
I can’t wake up
Life is a dream
I walk around endlessly
No one notices 
I’m alone
Drinks make me numb
Music makes me feel
No one notices 
I look for joy but only find emptiness 
I feel numb
I feel empty
Life goes on
I want help 
But I don’t 
Feelings makes the pain worse
They won’t come back"

mylastmoments,2021-12-08 21:33:16+00:00,my unending spiral,"It feels terrible to talk about, but it feels useless when this discussion buries itself into my notes folder. This is something I come back to over and over and over. 
I just want to be done. Maybe saying I just want to die isn’t fully what I mean. It just sounds like the easiest way to get part of what I want. Though I am still young, I’ve had the opportunities to experience very wonderful and exciting things. I’ve gotten to explore more waterfalls and mountains than I can count, I’ve gotten to spend time hitting phenomenal numbers in the gym, some of which set records in my state, I’ve felt a great deal of love and heartbreak and so many other things which have given me so much happiness. Man, I’ve gone spelunking, done a couple years of serious bodybuilding, travelled a good deal, owned rare cars, spent years getting decent at guitar, have written about 15 songs I really like and I’ve been fortunate enough to receive well-rounded training in mix martial arts. 
The telling part of my distress comes from my home life or lack thereof. My parents went into a relationship with kids from previous marriages and left their relationship with my brother and me. I went through my whole childhood with these unhappy, sour people who despised one another. In high school, I had one decent relationship but I never could get one to last. 
Just recently, I met this wonderful girl who checked more boxes than I knew I had. She’s turned me on to roller skating, inspired me to get a new piercing and there’s always something wicked to do with her. I actually met her 6 months ago when our friend invited us to go white water rafting. 
I know I’m jumping around a lot, but my brain is kind of mush. Well, she and I became very friendly. We’ve been hanging out a lot, but she’s just recently made me aware to the fact that she can’t be in a relationship right now. She told one of our friends Danny that she’d go out with him but without me knowing this, she kept hinting boldly to me that I should kiss her. I did because when a beautiful girl like her keeps saying she’d have already kissed you, you make things square. 
She put the two of us in the friend zone after this but she kept flirting with me. I can realize now that I was destined to get hurt from the beginning. She never intended on loving me. 
This is my pattern, though. I want what I can’t have because if I can obtain the impossible, I might then have a little more purpose. If I can make the impossible work, this life could be worth it. 
So today, I’m back to a thought I have every few months. Should I just get this over with? I’m tired of these hoops and games. I just want to be left to silence without a gripping sadness. I get very depressed very often and that’s been a fact for 6 years minimum. I’ve had two lazy attempts and I’m certain a third one would be my last attempt. I have no plan for it. I’m not too overwhelmed at this time, but I just want to share that life is not going well for me. I don’t understand why I can’t just be happy. Any ideas would be appreciated."

I do want to improve my situation in life, but I can't find the drive to move forward. 
Every day is the same. I wake up feel exhausted and distraught every day. I'm just tired of fighting."

LumiGloomy,2021-12-08 05:15:46+00:00,It’s hard to talk to my dad,"Our relationship is so rocky and he keeps doing things that I can’t handle processing anymore. 

Sometimes I get mad and think “you did this to me.” You caused my depression by your constant fighting. You abandoned us and made us leave behind all we knew because our Mom became suicidal from it all. You made me believe you had a good relationship with your new wife while you were emotionally abusing her just like my mom. You had an affair and cut off your family because they wouldn’t stand by your decisions.

I used to fantasize about going over to his house for holidays like he’d talk about. But he lost all my trust, I couldn’t even see him when I had the opportunity because I didn’t want to be alone with him. I was scared, what if he kills me? It’s dramatic I know but my anxiety makes me feel that way often. And because I don’t trust him, I don’t trust him with my life. 

Yet I hate myself for all these thoughts and feelings. I hate myself for hurting him. I hate myself for not being able to believe a word he says. 

I still struggle between wanting to be like him to feel closer and being scared to be anything like him. I’m afraid my family will hate me or compare me to him if I make a mistake. 

Sometimes I wish I never had a dad in my life so it wouldn’t hurt like this. I had a normal childhood, I had a normal dad. Suddenly my life was in boxes and my family wasting away. 

I don’t believe in love anymore, I don’t want to get into a relationship because I don’t want to be vulnerable with someone just to be abandoned later on.

And when my dad comes back acting like a normal dad, I cry. I felt like I lost my dad when he left us. Then I felt I lost my dad all over again when he had an affair. I couldn’t recognize him the second time. He did really bad things and I keep learning more as the years goes on. 

I yearn to have my normal dad back but I have to question what he’s going to do next that will shatter my image of him again. 

And please don’t say anything about cutting him out of my life. I can’t do it. I rarely talk to him right now anyways."

ContributionFun6491,2021-12-08 01:22:35+00:00,Everyone tells me to talk about what's bothering me: the problem is nobody wants to hear it,"So my parents are insane. I'm certainly greatful for all the things they e done for me that are positive but in some way they love gaslighting.

I'm not just a spoiled kid saying that either (although that's what they imply) I have been institutionalized twice and they have released me saying I'm fine.

I'm certainly depressed but it's because I'm forced to live in a stupid existence with all these lunatics surrounding me. Why would I love life if I have had my civil liberties suspended for no reason twice. On top of that my parents bought a condo off my ex girlfriends family after I begged them not too, we broke up and now I have to watch my older brother not pay his rent in my ex girlfriends condo while they treat me like a black sheep.

My ex left me with a dog right before she cheated on me and my family sided with her. I'm stuck living at home and I swear to God that everything is staged in my life. It feels like I'm living in a simulation created by these lunatics and there's no point in trying to achieve anything because as I said before my civil liberties can be suspended at any time for no fucking reason. Don't believe me? It happened twice already.

I'm just sick of living in general. These people are so self centered and love saying things like "" you should really talk to someone maybe a relative outside our immediate family or something"" - well that's be great but my parents and brothers already convinced everyone in town, my family and wherever else I'm the fucking world that I'm a lunatic.

wilting_wrld,2021-12-07 23:21:24+00:00,Too depressed to make the right decisions,"Lately Ive been feeling hollow and with bitter feelings about what I have achieved in my life so far. Every decision I make is forced, Im not spontaneous at all and I can't trust my intuition because I feel uninterested in everything and hopeless. 

I messed up major decisions. Like probably what I'm going to study In uni. I feel terrible about this I don't feel like I fit in with other students , I still feel kind of aimless and trapped here. It's not that I don't like it, I somewhat enjoy several aspects of it but I'm not passionate about it and it takes so much work and I don't really have the courage to study enough.

 I'm exhausted mentally from years of depression. I don't sleep properly, eat enough meals, live properly anymore. The pandemic doesn't help, I don't have friends basically and i just wander aimlessly in uni like a weirdo being anxious and I get embarrassed a lot in front of people because I'm so out of place .. 

Idk what to do I just feel like I'm so consumed by this situation I overthink all day long about how much money I spent to prepare for the entrance exams and I just don't feel passionate or competitive enough. Yes , objectively it is a very good degree opening several opportunities. Yes, I KIND OF like and I'm doing quite well academically, yes it is hard. No, Im not passionate. No I'm not so thrilled about related jobs. I'm not interested enough for anything to be honest.

After these conflicting thoughts that plague my mind I just feel freaked out and like I'm going to vomit and die of heart attack or something. How does one get out of this loop of wrong decisions when depressed? Every day I have like one moment of clarity realizing I probably made the wrong choice and I'm going to be miserable from now on. If I back off now I will have wasted a year of stressful studying  and quite a lot of money(I don't pay tuition though) I have no good plan of what to do even If I switch majors and I'm feeling lost in general.

I just feel like Im blind and bump into walls with my decisions not having a clue if Im on the right path and it's really taking its toll on my mental health ...

Sorry.. I know ive posted something similar before but I feel like I'm losing my sanity at this point. probably going to go to therapy, just want to know if anyone else feels the way I do about where they are in life"

There were 4 other male students who were ganging up on me and saying I was a pervert. Mind you, I am an asexual person, so I go against everything that means sex.

I'm really nervous to go to school tomorrow. I'm worried that the student may spread rumors about me, all because I was looking at somebody while they were talking because I was interested in what they were talking about. What's even more annoying is that there was a girl a month ago who groped my ass while I was working on something. Quite a few students noticed, and none of them said anything or was on my team.

Into the endless abyss I go.
No light in sight as all life goes.
Feeling pain as my vision darkens.
Tho shuffling into my own demise.
Losing last few remnants of who I was.
Only showing what I could become.
The passing of one, to create a better other.
Death is the ultimate selfless act.
Pain is the only way one grows.
With out it we would be none learning.
Inhuman.

Knowledge is a painful weight we must all bare.
Like a snake it requires pain to grow.
Like shedding our skin.
Humans are the kin of devils. 
Tempting one with false hopes and promise. 
No such thing as a selfless act. 
All dues must be paid.
Just like relationships. 
All must be billed. 
In prices of blood and time
It can’t be built with dimes.
It seems us humans love to wonder into our own demise. 

Pain it’s a glorious thing. 
It’s the only feeling that’s persistent. 
It lingers years after the memories ended. 
Reliving trauma just multiples it.
Like a spider giving loving its brood. 
It never ends it always persists. 
We only ever pass it to one an other. 
We do not mean to. 
We might not know better. 
But in the end. 
It’s only human to remember. 
Pain."

I feel like if I never had to be around other human beings then I could be happy, be myself, and feel comfortable doing what I needed to do, but I feel like I'm allergic to people, and therefore I have trouble being around humans.


One of my fantasies is that I never have to be around (or interact with) another human unless I want to and that my life can be lived alone as long as I want to.


I honestly find the idea of being a hermit more appealing then I do, interacting with people constantly.

We got into a fight? Oh, it was my fault. Our argument ended up with us not sleeping with eachother or going to sleep upset? Oh, that was MY FAULT too. Like I'm starting to get really tired of arguing and trying to make sure that we both understand that we both take part in an argument, but I think I just push that ""it's both of our faults"" so much that sometimes I force myself to think my partner is a problem  too. But has anyone of you ever tried to just always agree, no arguments, no disagreements, just ""yes"" and ""I'm sorry""? I know it sounds toxic but I literally don't know what to do anymore."

I wonder if they see me creeping. Sipping tea. Fogging up the glass in front of me. Imagining their lives. 

After my tea is done I have to get up tho. I have to force myself. But everything aches lol. How?

I was with a patient yesterday who told me “everyone says they’ll come back, but they never do.” I left to go see other patients. When I came back he was dead. No pulse. But it didn’t bother me. They all end up dying anyway lol. 

It rained last night. And so I got to walk through the sloshy ass grass this morning. No shoes obv. Just muddy ass blades of grass underneath my feet. Fuck that felt good. 

Lol found this ankylosaurus video on YouTube today. That’s a badass dinosaur I’m ngl. Swinging that ass around lmao. 

Every single one of my hoodie pockets have empty candy wrappers in them. Bright ass wrappers. Crinkly and loud. 

Wanna hear something depressing tho lol I hate plain spaghetti for lunch. No sauce, not even olive oil. 

I just ate the clump.

purpleflower133,2021-12-06 16:50:29+00:00,Im in a relationship after 4 years.,"It’s been a hell of a road for me in my past and dealing with an ex whom loved more than life itself. 

After being single I met someone. Someone who caught my attention and i wanted something with. 
We met 3 months ago and he recently asked me to be his gf. 

I felt that he felt pressured to ask me to be in a relationship. But I turned a blind eye. I guess it’s because he felt that then I would talk to other people as as he said “I don’t want to run out of time”. This is someone who has somehow o a fear of commitment. 
He’s told me he loves and and I’m the greatest thing ever. But for the past few days … he isn’t as communicative with me. He tells me all the right words and is the sweetest but his actions dosnt really match up. 
 I notice that he never leaves his phone alone. He always takes it with him. Even to use the restroom. He’s always hanging out with his guy friends which it isn’t a problem.. until it becomes a problem because he hasn’t offered to even see me as of recent. 
He also hasn’t posted me on social media. No snap. No Facebook relationship status. No ig stories.but he is very active on social media. 
Just been feeling like he dosnt want to let the public know that he is in a relationship. 
We’ve spoken ab this behavior but then he goes back into the same routine. And I just don’t even want to sag anything anymore because like what’s the point.  He always comes with this “I forgot it you know I’m forgetful but I will do better” 

I’ve never deal with this kind of game. Where a person is good with their words but actions dosnt match… Im unsure about things now. And it’s sucks because When I get into a relationship is a big deal for me since I don’t do relationships like that."

With every day that passes i feel lonelier and lonelier. The reason that i don't think i will find love is because i am not a very social person, i never have been and probably never will be.

Also, where i live, most people seem to be a hive mind. They all like and do the same things and its none of the things that i like or do. There is pretty much no diversity between anyone in my country, everyone is the same

Its hard to accept that i will probably be just one of those people that never finds love, i just don't know how to live with that fact. I don't see much point in living if i don't have someone to love and share my time here with"

And then what is there after this?  Work? They tell you your whole life “just wait til you start working before you complain!”’and they have the GALL to expect me to be exited for some fucking career??? Some 9-5 soulless bullshit?

Life has no meaning and that’s fine, but the WHAT the FUCK am I supposed to be doing here? Nothing is good enough to justify the constant FUCKING AGONY and MONOTONY that is living. Am what I’m SICK for not wanting to live this? My brain is wrong? We cant make life worth living so we just drug ourselves and use delusional thinking like some dystopia??

But no I’m the weirdo. I’m the freak for thinking like this. I’m “mentally ill.” I’m “crazy.” Living this fucking sham is crazy.

Only the privileged get to enjoy life. Only the attractive and mentally well get to be happy. Only they get to have friends and go on adventures and be blindly excited for their next fucking worthless day in their lives. The rest of us aren’t even human to them. At best we’re pitiful animals.

It gets better my ass. It gets worse. You work that same job. You make the same empty small tall. You play the same meaningless games and watch the same meaningless movies. It’s an endless spiral of the same empty shit. It’s nothing 

This is an existential nightmare and I’m futilely screaming into the void. No one hears me. This is some I have no mouth and Imust scream bullshit."

Basically I’ve had a fairly amazing upbringing both my parents have well paying jobs and have stayed together despite it getting close sometimes, most people would say I was spoiled as a kid and I would agree to an extent however it only really started when my little brother turned five or so as he was diagnosed with autism so my parents began giving him pretty much anything he wanted which also applied to me to since they didn’t want to show favouritism they were definitely more lenient with my brother though. I first really started feeling depressed when I entered junior high however it was mostly was a product of the phase I was in and manifesting the feelings by trying to be like many of the friends I hung around with however even after I stopped hanging out with them in high school I still felt the same and it started getting worse when I began getting crushes and asking people out as I was definitely sort of labeled as the weird kid but from what I learned at the time it was normal to feel that way after rejection and breakups so that’s what I chalked it up to fast forward to now I haven’t had a job as I never felt the need for one as I didn’t need to pay for anything and I was always focused on school, I’m 20 years old now still living with my parents I’m in my third year of college taking my first year of nursing all my school is payed for I’m in the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in which has lasted more than a year now and I’m doing fairly well in all my courses despite all of this I still feel depressed some days debilitatingly so my girlfriend wants to move in together however neither of us have the money and I really can’t because of college I feel horrible for disappointing her despite her saying she’s not disappointed we also have had very different upbringings which sometimes makes me feel bad for the way I was raised as we don’t agree on things regarding life my parents put a fair amount of pressure on me with my studies but I would say it’s necessary as I can be rather unmotivated most of the time. All of these things definitely contribute to my depressive feelings however what I would say is the biggest contributor would be the fact I want to get a job after Christmas however I have utterly no motivation to do so because of my depressive feelings but because of that I feel more depressed. The realization that I’m 20 and I haven’t had a job, haven’t lived on my own, can still barely hold a conversation to save my life, and I have little to no life experience makes me depressed and I know it shouldn’t and the fact that it does makes it worse and I don’t know what to do, I’m not suicidal or anything at least not to the extent that I’d ever do something, I just want to feel better"

I have a terrible relationship with my parents and it just makes me wonder if it is worth living, I have no friends, I have no other family except for my parents, and I have no one to talk to, I have had this relationship with them for as long as I can remember and they have always made me feel like this, they have never cared for my mental health not even when I openly tell them that i feel depressed, they have always told me that they regret having me, that they would abandon me if they could, and that I should just kill myself, I have always been bullied at school because of how I am and how I look and they have never cared in the slightest, people have done and said all kind of things to me but I have never told anyone about it, not even my parents since they would not believe me. My brother died some years ago and my parents have always told me that I should have been the one that died, I cry myself until morning wondering why is this happening to me, I don’t eat, i don’t care about my health in any regard and I don’t talk to anyone about this at school, I feel like I’m in hell and that there is no way out, I lost hope on everything at this point, I don’t want to kill myself but I just don’t know what to do anymore, I just wish that my parents cared about me"
ShoulderCheap5960,2021-12-06 06:21:37+00:00,Spinning my wheels,"It is now 2 years after being broken up with from a 3 year relationship with my ex. It sent me into a world of darkness and I felt like I had a storm cloud following me everywhere I went.  

Now, I’ve never been a very social person when it comes to being in public, I guess my self esteem is not that great to the point where I feel like I should not even try to be social. I digress.  

Feelings of depression are met with deep sense of anger towards myself and ultimately towards the whole situation I am in. Im on medication to keep the dark cloud away from everyday activities but I still have moments where I could punch a whole in the wall in anger.

Why so angry you ask? Because I, not being the social butterfly, met this amazing woman who was beautiful in every sense of the word. Athletic, funny, caring and oh so positive about life. These kind of traits that bring out the best of me and my life changed in so many positive ways. I’m on cloud 9 and we are inseparable. Never got physical with eachother never argued. We just really enjoyed the company and time together. A future was guaranteed to be bright together. But a few events out of our control through friends and family opened up some holes and created some doubt in her mind. Which put a strain on our relationship that we tried to recover from but she eventually had too much and called it quits. 

So yeah, the anger is still prevalent. How could I let such an all around beautiful girl lose interest enough to the point that a simple talk and change of direction couldn’t fix. I am still crushed. Again being unsuccessful in the social world I now feel like I’m doomed for life. In my 30s struggling to still pick up myself while living at home and not having a strong base of success to build on to even be attractive enough for a girl to want to spend time with. I’m tired of giving my family and friends the same old depression updates because nobody seems to care, and if they do care they have no answers for me. So I keep my feelings and thoughts locked inside which makes everything oh so much worse.

I’m a mess and I’m spinning my wheels. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?"

I’m 55, separated, incredibly overweight and out of shape. I know all the things I should be doing. Eat better. Drink more water. Get active even in small ways to start. Lose weight. 

But these issues aren’t new - these are things I should have done every day for 2-3 decades. So many nights, I go to bed promising myself that I’ll do X or Y to start making changes to make myself healthier, happier and feeling better. But I don’t do those things.

I try to be as active as possible with my depression but man does body dysmorphia really badly affect me. I see myself as the ugliest person on the planet some days. i have no confidence, it’s really bad. Sometimes during a conversation my brain just repeats “you’re ugly” “this person thinks you are hideous” and it is just horrible. I would never wish this on my worst enemy. If you asked my parents they would say i’m a very happy kid but it’s far from the truth. At least 50 times a day i say “can i just die” or “kill yourself” but it’s something I would never be able to do because of guilt. I love both of my parents and my whole family but my mom especially is a saint and making her grieve and adding stress to a life full with stress for her wouldn’t allow me to Rest in piece.

I’m empty, I cry about 5 times a day or more on a daily basis, then start feeling numb for the rest of the day, the only things I feel are pain and sadness, nothing is enjoyable anymore, nothing can make me crack a smile and nothing seems to be able to bring me out of this black hole I’m in.

I look at people at school enjoying every single second of their day, laughing all the time and look genuinely happy, while I feel like an outcast, disconnected from the outside world, like a spectator of others’ lives, what are they happy about ? Living a meaningless life with no purpose that’ll inevitably end up in unbearable pain ? what’s the point ? I’m so lost."

helloagainhithere,2021-12-05 15:58:29+00:00,Are the following things widely believed about women and ageing?:,"That women become invisible with age, mostly to men 

That men prefer younger women 

That women are obsessed with looking younger and fear ageing and jealous of younger women 

That society is obsessed with youth in women and sees younger women as superior, even older women themselves see them in that way 

That beauty is all about how much younger you look 

That men cheat and leave their wives for younger women and that rich men will want younger women. 

How do women accept all these things without feeling depressed? Why do they instead cater to it all? Is it so ingrained?

ereavnydae,2021-12-05 13:56:34+00:00,Just getting my thoughts out.,"I feel beyond lost right now. Everything that I do or consider doing seems like nothing but a waste of time. I tell myself that it's pointless because someone will undo it. I don't go anywhere because I find it difficult to go alone and I tell myself that everyone is busy and I don't need to bother them. When I do talk myself into asking, they are busy and it usually triggers a downward spiral of being unwanted.

The fog inside my head has gotten so thick that I struggle to make it through a few hours without forgetting the things that have happened or completely ignoring the world around me and fading away into the mist of my own thoughts and sorrows. Sometimes it seems just like I've walked into an extremely thick fog, alone and afraid, and I will never find my way out.

I don't know what has caused this to get so much worse than normal. I am taking my medications like I'm supposed to. I am doing everything that I can to keep myself from crashing and burning, but I am so tired of feeling like one my grain of sand will shatter me. 

I don't feel like I have the energy to keep this fight up for much longer. I keep telling myself that I can't break because I have too many people depending on me. I realize that sometimes even the strong have to be supported, but my support system is gone. I have one person I can fully rely on, and she has her own struggles going on right now.

Jolly_Tea7519,2021-12-05 03:33:20+00:00,Anyone experience a tremendously good week after having a severe dissociative episode?,"I (41F) have been in a significant depression the past 3 years. Several med changes and then I lost insurance and couldn’t afford OOP costs. 
A few weeks ago I had a severe dissociative episode. I found myself staring in the mirror for hours because it didn’t look like me, instead of playing on my phone I’d just stare at the ceiling, sounds weird but I felt like a floating head. My body didn’t feel like it was there much less my own. I didn’t feel the floor on my feet, I had to try and inflict pain on myself to see if the arm I was looking at was really part of me. 
This gradually got better over 2-3 weeks. Then one day I woke up and felt amazing! No intrusive thoughts, energy to do things after work, no crying for a full 7 days! It was great. I was so happy and almost felt that life wasn’t going to be completely miserable until I die. 
Then it all went away at the drop of a hat. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I woke up this morning and was in a great mood. My husband and I got in a minor argument and now I’m back to tears streaming down my face for no apparent reason. I just want to stay in my room away from everyone again. 
That week was amazing. I’m typically a functioning depressed person but these past 3 years I have to force myself to shower, I over eat constantly, I don’t make plans with anyone. I’m just a shell going to work and try not to alienate my family. So when I had that exceptionally bad episode where I also slacked at work and had difficulty interacting with my loved ones I honestly felt like I should not be here. Not kill myself but, just gone. I would love to have that week back. 
Has anyone gone through this?"
InfernousWater,2021-12-05 03:14:08+00:00,I honestly dont know if im depressed or just tired of everything,"I have a caring gf, a good family, high intelligence and generally a good life, but i just dont know if i can enjoy stuff the same way i used to enjoy them, i have forgotten how to play the guitar, my grades dropped, i have no friends anymore and i dont enjoy the only sport im good at (i dont know how it is in english but tennis with walls)
The only times i find myself being happy are when i have my gf close, but other than that, im never visually happy like everyone around me, i just want my smile back man."
Elevated-Knight-Owl,2021-12-05 03:08:50+00:00,I don't understand myself,"Since I was younger (around the age of 13) I started to notice the effects of staying at home and being cooped up on the computer all day, whether it was for school or play. I would spend my day on a laptop doing my school for the duration of middle school and the world was my oyster. I met my father once and he gave me his toshiba laptop and a psp, and I would play this game called ""PlazmaBurst2"" while pretending to be a girl in-game for attention. I would wake up at around 7 and stay up till 3 or 4 every night watching anime and chatting with people on kongregate. This was my paradise, this was my escape from the constant yelling , screaming, and punishments from my mother who was in college and working at the same time. I was adopted into the internet and have slowly lost myself over the years.  I am now 20 years old and have absolutely nothing going on except a shitty part time job. 

Sorry for the rant so far, that's just the origin to my story I guess.

I've known somethings been wrong with me for a while, but a few weeks ago I took myself to the doctors about a cyst I had, we took care of it and then she asked me about my mental health. I talked to her for a while and she summarized that I have severe depression. She offered me medicine that would help (which I refused) and asked me to come in for blood work so she could check on it and see if everything is good.

I feel guilty. Other people have more of a reason to be depressed then I do, and yet I now have this card stapled into my scalp stating that I have this disease. I'm terrified to try medicine as I am a hypochondriac and will think of everything that could go wrong. I feel like I don't deserve my life? I haven't ever opened up before like this so I thought I'd give it a try as I've been feeling pretty empty today. 

this is a weird post but thanks for reading through it."

Ive lost touch with every female I used to talk to, every friend i had. I know its not going to stay this way forever because I know I can make friends, but it just seems so difficult to make friends/have a tight friend group in the real world. I do online community college so theres literally zero way to have ""college friends"" either. Is there any tips/advice you guys could give? Or any insights at all would help alot. I know its not gonna stay like this because Ive had friends my whole life, but everything just vanished out of no where. I feel really lonely at the end of the day and the feeling of loneliness just makes me feel so empty. I wish I could go out and do things with other people like me and talk to females."

RandoJen4,2021-12-04 21:18:09+00:00,So Done,"1. I’m going through the process of filing my claims with the VA. For physical, mental and dental. The mental part…. I had a ptsd/traumatic event evaluation that has me wondering just how f’d up I truly am. 
This all started because I decided I wanted to be a better me. Lose weight. I joined a program. Then started with behavioral therapy to address my dependency on food for happiness. This then led to the ptsd eval. I’ve gained 5lbs. 
2. Getting my dental stuff all taken care of. Freaking wisdom teeth pulled, turned into a corner of my jaw bone poking a hole through my gums and requiring a bone file, to seriously file down the spot. Anyway. I’m a fat kid who hasn’t been able to eat in 3 days. Water brings pain. Lost 2lbs.
Guess that’s a step in the right direction.
3. It’s fair to say I am gullible. A bit naive. I am also horrible with money. I have been my whole life. Raised poor, always looking for quick fixes when it comes to emergencies. Anyway,on thxgvg I asked my sister for some help with gas money. It led to her asking another member to make change. Somehow, it ended with my dad and stepmom pissed that another family member helped, my sister got super mad at them and blocked them, and now my stepmom blames me for not being able to see her grandkids(my sisters kids).
I also just got scammed out of my last bit of cash by a highschool friend who said I had a blessing. So desperate for a way out. That I believed.

Yes I know I’m stupid for thinking others would have my best interest at heart. Ultimately I just needed a place to vent. I’m on the verge of filing for bankruptcy. Before Christmas, which somehow I’ve ruined for my family, by existing. And I can’t even eat a dang piece of chocolate without feeling like I’m being stabbed in the face.
I’ll have my pity party for the rest of the day, then don the mask I use for the public and take my broke ass to work tomorrow. Someone has to feed my animals."

During the drive and while at the airport, he barely paid attention to me at all and was playing a game on his phone the whole time. Even though it was obvious that I was dying inside. He didn't hold or kiss me and barely even touched or talked to me. And when he went to board the plane, he gave me a half assed hug and didn't even kiss me goodbye, so I made him turn around and come back to kiss me. If I hadn't done that, we wouldn't have had a final kiss at all, which is probably dumb to most people, but it really hurt. I wish we held each other more because now I really fucking need it."

iamsidsilver,2021-12-04 17:50:04+00:00,"Tired of being lonely, desperate and jealous","So… idk I’m just lonely? Thats it lmao. My old friends and I grew apart, some backstabbed me and we dont talk anymore, my college is online and so i cant find new people in college. I have like 2 friends? I dont see them often. Those 2 have their own life, bunch of friends, work to do and here I am. Sometimes, my loneliness doesnt bother me much because I spend all day by myself. Exercising, watching movies etc. But when I’m bored? When I need some company? Or when I’m home alone? I got no one to call. 

Usually teens get happy when their parents leave their home for a while so they can call their girlfriends or boyfriends. I feel life is playing a joke on me at this point because my parents keep going out for work and it just reminds me I have to just spend time by myself as usual with no one to call. I go out for walks, for cycling (all by myself) to calm myself and get out of my bed and all I see are couples. Teen couples, couples in their 20s, adult couples. All sorts of friend groups. It makes me feel terribly inferior. I feel they would laugh at me if they come to know about my social life.

I am not a perfect person, i dont want to self term myself as a “nice” guy because nobody is as aware of my flaws as myself. But man, I am finding it really hard to deal with so much mess. This huge pile of mess involves - self hate, loneliness, sexual desperation, jealousy, envy and maybe much more. I know this is a long read. I’m still not used to it.

Continuing to exist simply for the sake of it is extremely self-defeating and pointless, but I'm too much of a helpless coward for anything else. I completely pissed away my teenage years and my 20s hiding away from the world, and I don't see my 30s being any different. I'm totally trapped in my circumstances and there's essentially no way out, at least not one that I can realize. I feel like an animal stuck in a small cage at the zoo, one that's been trapped there so long it'd be a death sentence to release it back into the wild. I have no place in this world, and I genuinely wish that I'd never been born."
bigassoh,2021-12-04 14:53:36+00:00,Just a little something I wrote when depression really hit me hard,"My pain never ends
The loop has once again began.
I can feel my tears falling slowly on my cheeks.
My Heart once again stoped beating, 
Or maybe I'm just too numb to feel my pulse.
My wounds that I thought would finally close, violently opened up again, making them bigger.
I think I can see the bone now.
But I still can't feel it
I was stupid enough to believe in my self again.
I was stupid enough to believe that this time I would be happy and it would stay that way.
I was stupid enough to open up again.
I keep making the same mistakes, never learning anything.
I keep making people feel sorry about me.
I keep making people get tired of me. 
I keep ruining peoples lives. 
I keep ruining everyone's mood.
I keep being selfish. 
No matter what I do, it always ends the same way.
Every road leads to the same path.
I feel like a test subject with my purpose being testing the limitations of feelings of grieve and pain to a human heart and mind.
I'm really tired of being numb. 
I'm really tired of being depressed.
I'm really tired of being alive,
But I'm also really tired of this loop of false hope.
For how many more years is this gonna continue?
People keep telling me that it'll be over soon.
But with every birthday that goes by,
I realize that I'll never be free.
With every birthday that goes by I cry even more.
With every birthday, I keep wishing more and more I was never born.
I barely lasted 7 years of this shit.
And I don't know how much more I can take.
Maybe I don't deserve to be happy. 
Maybe I should just shut up.
Maybe I should just stay alone.
Maybe I should stop ruining everyone's lives.
Maybe I should forget about my promises and,
Maybe I should finally do it again,

But right this time. . .
Without fail...

I hope youre not reading this.
If you are, I'm either ????, or you somehow convinced me to show this to you.
Or maybe you're reading this without me knowing it.
Whichever the case,
Please forget this.
Don't waste your time.
Don't let me break you too, even if you already were broken.
Don't let me make you worry.
Please it hurts. 
I don't want to lose you too.
I don't want you to pitty me. 
I don't want you to think about me. 
I don't want you to pay attention to me because of this.
The pain I feel right now, is better that the pain I'd feel if you knew about this.
I don't want to have another wound, there's no space left.
There's no more skin left.
No more blood.
Just an empty husk.
So please...
Stop reading.
Stop thinking about this.
Forget it.
And then stop talking to me.
Ignore me.
The same way you sometimes do.
Only this time never answer.
Never look at my messages.
Block me.
Block my number.
Leave me alone,
The way it should've been from the start.
I'm sorry you met me.
I'm sorry about this.
I'm sorry about existing.
I'm sorry about everything.
That's the only thing I'm good at.
Be sorry

What did I do to deserve this?
People that don't know this side of me tell me I'm a really nice guy.
So why is this happening to me?
Am I being nice for them?
Or am I being nice for me?
Is this happening because of my selfishness?
Can someone love me?
Am I asking too much?
I guess begars can't be choosers. 
I'm so dramatic.
I'll shut up now.
I'm sorry.
 
Goodbye. 

May we never meet again.
Because if we did,
Then you'd be ????.
      
Whoever is reading this, know that I love you with every little feelings I have left.
Because only people I love will ever be able to read this.
I hope you live your life full of happiness with no regrets.
I'm glad I met you, even tho it hurt both of us.

Edit:
I find it really fucking funny.
How I say oh don't read this, oh please no I don't want you to know how depressed I am, but in reality I fucking know how goddamn selfish I am
I know damn well I want someone to read this and give me attention
But that would just fuck up my relationship with others
So I don't want it
But I want it
You see?
Not that it fucking matters anymore
No one is gonna see this
Well unless I decide to fucking kill myself that is
I'm such a clown 
So dramatic 
So useless
So full of shit 
I understand well enough why people always end up like this with me
But I don't know how to fix this
And I won't know
Ever
Can someone just fucking kill me?
Just so that my family knows it wasn't a suicide 
How can I be such an asshole but at the same time care about them
Why do I have to be like this
Why am I alive 
I don't deserve happiness but I seek it
I don't wanna cry anymore, but I still do everyday 
Please
End it
Please
I can't find any other way out
Im really fucking tired
I can't take it anymore 
I wish I could just disappear without affecting anyone 
I wish I could just stop
A social failure
Or rather a failure at everything 
Fuck my stupid life 
Fuck my feelings 
Fuck my inner thoughts 
Fuck everything"
wilting_wrld,2021-12-04 14:06:22+00:00,Depression is seriously affecting my decisions and people around me,"I've been severely depressed since I was 13. Suffering from anxiety basically all my life. Not particularly social, always had kind of shitty friends that dumped me in the end or behaved like assholes or were weirdos in general. I never feel like I fit with my surroundings, I seriously feel like I havent lived yet. Now I'm 18 and went through shit to get into a uni to study something hard I'm not sure at all I like, probably fucked up my decisions while feeling hopeless about the horrid job prospects in my country and in general.

I know there are things I enjoy such as cooking, or hairdressing (but only as hobbies and it's a shame not to utilize my mental abilities into university studies, especially in such a competitive job market). I also like nature but I drifted away from it since I couldn't mentally handle chemistry or physics or anything like that anymore, even though I somewhat liked these too.

Everything I do feels futile, I'm so miserable right now it's taking a toll on my loved ones mental health and I can't take it.. I can't even make decisions about the most unimportant small things in my life and every day is a decision-making hell because I over analyze the outcomes of my decisions and how it can affect my life. It has become pathological at this point and I feel severe guilt about spending money to the point I don't want to shower for too long, or eat too much, or spend on petrol or on clothes..

I hate the fact that I'm ranting right now but I'm at a point in life where I feel so fucked up that I can't just say hey forget about it and go on with my day because it's the same dull routine of staying at home due to basically not having any friends, let alone the spiraling covid situation which is stressful enough...

Anyway.. I would appreciate any advice, and sorry if I wasted your time I just can't take it anymore"

I can’t seem to move on. I keep thinking and dreaming about him. I just want to forget him but I still love him. I keep feeling like I lost a part of me, like he was my soulmate and now I lost the chance forever. I keep hoping that maybe we’ll be together again in the future but then again he didn’t treat me right in the first place.

There’s no way we can reconcile, he has moved on and has been in a new relationship for 6 months. We’ve blocked each other on social media because things ended really badly so we don’t communicate anymore. 

He left me because he couldn’t deal with me and my depressive episodes. What hurts the most is that I feel like a burden, i fear that everyone will get fed up of me like he did. It also hurts that he has moved on so fast, like I didn’t mean a thing. I keep blaming myself.

Also, whenever I stand in front of a mirror I feel like someone's watching me through it. I also have thought of hurting myself, which I'm already doing, and others.

My grand mother has bipolar disorder so I'm at a higher risk of developing a similar mental disorder myself than most people.

furious_glory27,2021-12-03 17:45:16+00:00,I'm Going To Revise my Suicide Note,I found an old suicide letter I wrote from 2017.  It was in an old notebook  I use to write in.  Some things have changed since then. However for the most part. I still feel the same.  I feel the need to revise it.  I think I'm more sad now than I was  then.  I've  just had enough of everything. Nothing feels right. I'm  sad all the time. Tired all the time.  Don't  feel seen or  heard or loved  or cared about.  Truth is don't  nobody really  give a damn about me. Never have and probably never will.  It hurts cause I do anything  and everything  for anyone and everybody.  But no one cares for me genuinely.  If I'm  not  doing what people want then they don't  care about me.   It hurts cause I really be trying  to make people happy and no one cares if I'm  happy.  What about me? What about what I want? How I feel? I'm  tired of feeling unloved and unwanted.  I've  had enough and I'm  fed up.  I want to feel better. I want someone to love me for real. This hurts and I should move on. Anyway I'm going to revise my suicide note.  Not saying I'm  gonna do it but sometimes you just  never know how the day may go. . . .

I’ve done everything possible, even opening up to people I considered as close friends and acknowledging my mental health issues, but it only made it worse because of the constant disinterest and lack of understanding.

This pain has been consuming me from the inside for so long, to a point where I’m nothing but an empty shell, who can’t feel anything but sadness, numbness, hatred, sorrow and pain, it’s just too much to take.

I can’t go on, I can’t continue trying to live a pointless life pretending that it’ll get better, because it won’t, it never will, I always knew I’d come to this, but lied to myself expecting that maybe one day these dark thoughts would disappear.

I hope that anyone dealing with this agony will  be able to heal, I hope you’ll go on to live a life full of joy and success, I, on the other hand, couldn’t make it, it all ends now, and no one will even notice because I never meant anything to anyone.

FlyMeToSaturn_,2021-12-03 05:40:44+00:00,I live in a 24/7 fantasy world.,"
I spend an overwhelming amount of my time in my head. My work days are complete blurs to me because I'm daydreaming. I've been caught talking to myself out loud several times by coworkers. I know that I come off as a very odd and creepy person, but I sincerely do not mean to. I've come to the end of myself trying not to.  I'm super awkward and shy so I imagine myself confident and with a lot of friends. I imagine myself as a funny and likeable person. 

I'm 29 but I fantasize more in one day than I ever did in all my childhood. I feel on the brink of tears every day at work, so I'm imagining violent and horrible things. No, I'd never go through with anything like that. But the thoughts are there all the same. I feel like I'm in the movie Joker. Everything is fine when I'm in my head and then something happens and I come crashing back down to reality and I'm angry, scared, sad, and confused all over again. 

And I don't know if I ever would, but I have thought a lot today about it. I cannot find any reason not to kill myself. Again, I am not sure if I could actually do it. But at the same time, I cannot find any negative effect of it for myself. If I am dead then would I really have the capacity to regret? Doesn't my embarrassment and regret die with me?"
JudgmentDull2480,2021-12-03 04:21:23+00:00,The only time I've ever been able to express my true feelings ..,"No one is ever going to know your pain.

How you feel alone..

How you see others happy, when you put a fake smile on each day...

Coming to the place you call home, empty silence where you eat alone once again.

The feeling of emptiness, but also the feeling of caring too much.

A constant war between your heart and your brain.

You try to please others so they like you... but you know in your heart they would never do the same.

You play victim to your own creation, but you are the culprit to your own self destruction.

Others search for careers, while you are just searching for that light...

Light that will make the darkness disappear.

You’ve been fighting ever since your dad died.

You grasp so strongly onto someone that will make you believe in love again... you believe you can love, but never yourself...

You can't see when other people care for you and love you because of how you let others treat you.

You settle for less. You don't believe you deserve anything more than less.

You want to be treated like shit, you want drama in your life, atleast it’s a feeling you already know.  You’ll feel completely empty without it... You don't feel joy anymore, you feel like a part of you has died.

You’d sleep with random souls under the moonlight to try and feel something again....

Now it feels like nothing at all. Just empty feelings and doubt.

What if you meet that light, then it doesn’t feel good enough, what if it makes you feel nothing too?

Goodbyes aren't hard anymore, you feel numb and confused of why you feel nothing.

You settle for darkness.

You crave it. It’s an addiction with no cure.

Maybe there is a cure.

You are the cure.

Let yourself feel joy again"

_____myself_____,2021-12-03 02:38:20+00:00,Life feels like a grey blur,"And not just because of covid. In fact, over the past year or so, I've been arguably more socially active than I was before, thanks to lots of group hiking and other similar events I've been attending.

But my life feels like it's just blurring by, week by week. I work full time from home and it has given me so much more freedom too. I get my work done, but it also allows me to work on personal stuff for a bit on a whim when the mood strikes. Before, I'd have those moods hit while at work but when I got home, I'd have no motivation anymore.

Regardless, I feel empty. Every time I think about being in a romantic relationship, my brain tells me it wouldn't work or would require too much energy or something. Like I can't imagine sharing a life with someone else, because mine is so bland as it is. Not to mention how impossible it feels just to go on a date too. It's too much mental energy just to keep trying. I've had several conversations peter out into nothing in the past few weeks. I guess I'm just boring, or if you wait longer than a few days to propose a coffee date they forget you and move onto someone else. Or if you ask too early, they think you're too eager. What's really happening though is probably just that another person comes along who is better looking.

But anyway, I digress. I feel so burned out, but I'm not even working that hard. I spend most of my time jumping between online media and practicing creative hobbies, and the occasional outdoorsy activity once or twice every couple weeks. My life just feels so lackluster and pointless, aimless, without drive or meaning, etc. Usually I find meaning in creating stuff but I'm burned out that way too. Thinking about trying to make something just gives me low key anxiety."

My weight is not life-threatening or anything and it doesn’t impede my daily life, in fact I sometimes forget I’m an ugly, fat person. But as soon as I look in the mirror, I remember it all. It’s the reason no one actually loves me. Because Im just so ugly due to my size. 

I was raised to be irresponsible with food and so now it’s very hard to try and diet, so I’m going to try and just starve myself. I’ll drink a glass of milk or something in the morning, just enough to get my metabolism going and then I’ll survive off of water for the rest of the day. Hopefully I’ll eventually lose enough to where Im content and no longer ugly because of my weight and then I can actually eat like a normal person, with small, healthy meals three times a day. 

Hopefully then people will be more willing to love me."

I’m wondering if I should have my parents pay it even though I might commit suicide in the next coming months. Obviously if I do my entire schooling and tuition payments my parents have made so far would be a waste. I’m conflicted about all of this and was wondering what I should do. I’m a 3rd year and my parents have paid all tuition payments at my semi expensive university.
ardent_girl,2021-12-01 21:22:41+00:00,25F Looking for Advice,"Hi all.

So to not make this long and overwhelming, I have been struggling with depression for a painful 8 years (I cannot believe that, it is so strange to type that large of a number). I’m going to be starting to talk to someone professional about it. I have thought about this so long and the time is really overdue. I am glad I’m in this spot however and finally taking care of what is really the biggest issue in my life. My symptoms are having little energy, little motivation (find it difficult to get out of bed some days and carry out my tasks which starts the bad cycle). I used to have anxiety but thankfully not anymore. I want to end feeling this way and begin to see an actual change. 

I’m looking for advice regarding medications. What has really worked for you? Please let me know the name, dosage and length of time you were/are on it.

Thanks plenty."

It isn't easy going through the motions of depression but the support was nice for those that messaged me, commented, etc. I thank you and I hope to be a beacon for those that need the light within their own darkness times. I appreciated everyone that took the time out to talk to me. Even if I didn't have much to say. I appreciate you. Thank you. You have no idea what it means to me when someone sees a person in pain and the comfort of words could do for someone. 

Update: I am feeling better. I am not sure why but today feels a lot better. Thanksgiving was just rough for me I suppose. The holidays, first time without having my mother isn't something I am accustom to. Christmas is right around the corner but when I cross that bridge, I'll worry about it then. Until then, I will cherish the moments that I have of being.... okay."

Dragonfly_515,2021-12-01 07:57:08+00:00,Hating that money is so important,"I am sick of thinking about money so much. I am the person who always needs a plan and uncertainty is just too much to handle. I have “voluntarily” (mostly anxiety but some depression in there) left three full time jobs in three years. I thought I could make by with money from delivering food. It’s working pretty well but over the last 10 months I have had so many ups and downs and overall have gone down. 

I have been on medication for depression since I was 19 (just turned 39) and have only just found a therapist I actually get along with and that is helping me. I have never wanted to ask for help when I am not able to hold a job. But my parents have always been there for me and most recently I lived with them for three years rent free. I know I’m lucky to have family but I’m also not an adult when I’m there. 

I applied for government disability in February because I felt I had tried as hard as I could to make money on my own and I just couldn’t do it anymore. I got denied. I went ahead and appealed but only yesterday found out what I feel is the main reason I was denied. My mental health prescriber actually said one of my biggest problems is that I’m irritable. He said I do have a lot of good days and I’m improving with medication. I just want to scream. He makes me sound like a lazy spoiled brat. Yes, one of my problems is being irritable and I do have good days. That’s why I have bipolar depression. And yes, I’m doing better because I told him I no longer wanted to actively kill myself. I see him next week so I’m trying really hard not to be so mad until I hear what he has to say. 

I saw my therapist today and she said she was never consulted or asked for any records. She is great but I can’t be fully honest with her. I voluntarily checked myself into the hospital in February because I wanted to kill myself. I had a plan but no attempt. I stayed at a place for the weekend and I don’t ever want to do that again. It’s so humiliating. I got black out drunk last night (not intentionally if that matters) and know I took sleeping pills and some anti anxiety pills. But since I don’t have a full memory I don’t know if I actually wanted to kill myself or I was just sick of being awake and wanted to fall asleep quickly. If I tell someone this I’m afraid I’ll be told to go to a hospital again. My therapist did let me know to call her or an emergency number if I thought I would do something but I can’t do that. I can’t go to that hospital again. 

I can’t believe all this is from money. And I’m talking about rent, gas money, not losing millions in the market or something. I can’t go back to my parents. I can’t survive yet another circle in my life. I won’t go backwards again. That’s not life. 

I didn’t mean this to be so long. It’s just so crazy to me that this is all about money. All about affording the basic things in life. 

I just want the pain to stop."

I take full responsibility for putting myself out there; I should have simply stayed inward. I just don't know how to move through this or to navigate the world any longer.

The_Eraser123,2021-11-30 23:57:23+00:00,Anyone else choose to hide their interests/ hobbies from others?,"I think anhedonia is one of the most frustrating and upsetting symptoms of depression. Watching helplessly as the things you once loved and that always made you happy suddenly elicit no enjoyment whatsoever and simply pass you by like a cool breeze. And the harder you try to like this thing, the more empty inside you feel and the more futile the activity becomes.

It’s this anhedonia that makes finding a hobby or interest I actually do enjoy quite a big deal for me. I get to add something to the very small list of things that make me feel that living is actually worthwhile. 

Now in most of my experience in dealing with other people, whether it be “friends” or family, people love to put down others for their interests, especially when that interest is somewhat outside of the norm. In some ways I feel like it’s a big “screw you for finding something that makes you happy, you’re supposed to stay miserable like the rest of us”.

As much as I hate this about myself, I am very very sensitive to what others think and say. It practically takes just one person to jokingly tell me they think my interest is stupid or boring and then I’ll find that I can’t enjoy that thing anymore because of what they said.

Given what I mentioned previously about anhedonia already limiting the amount of things in life I can actually enjoy, I really don’t need other people to contribute toward that too. As a result, I keep the interests/ hobbies that matter most to me hidden from most people. I don’t want to risk them ridiculing me for that interest and then finding that I have one less thing I enjoy about life to keep me going. 

Does anyone else do this?"

I'm really snappy, I get mad so fast and take it out on him.
He tells me he needs me, (just till this thing in 2 months) and after that he'll walk away. But he can't let me leave him yet.
He was recovering from addiction and I can't get over all the shit that happened during that, he says he's nearly well and he just needs me till then.

I was a loud, proud, outgoing, dgaf feminist bitch. I had very strict don't cross this line with me values for red flags and how I want to live my life. 
I gave into helping someone, who would love me during the covid and promised I would go through the hard times with them and I can't do it.
I can't seem to rationalise to him that I can't stand his values, be keeps telling me were the same, we want the same things all because he wants to get married and have kids and for the first time in my life, during the hectic euphoria of the height of our relationship, I could see us having a family and being happy.
But in reality, my friends hate him, he does and says a bunch of stuff that I would never stand anyone else doing and I'm lost.
I need to stick this out until january so he doesn't have a breakdown.
I feel like I'm going to have one.

dontcarefornowpls,2021-11-30 20:32:38+00:00,Just depressed and tired.,"Hello, first of all i am only posting this on Reddit so that I don't get judged nor i want people that actually know me to know about my situation.

I'm \[18F\] and I'm a Computer science student or should I say  IT engineer idk my english is bad. Growing up and until my last year in highschool, I was always top of my grades, always considered the smartest girl in my school. I had the best marks without any effort and if i work hard enough i got best results in the whole city, was the person who people wanted to sit beside her in test so that they can copy her answers. Teachers, family, friends used to tell my parents that I am kinda of a precocious kid and that I will probably end up being someone important and the fact that my parents are wealthy i can go study abroad with no difficulties(not to brag because I really think I'm not in a position to.) I was the kid that all my friends' parents desired. I also didn't have any difficulties to get new friends, true I was socially awkward and had some troubles sometimes talking to people tnx bullying but i was able to talk to at least few people a day, and being the smart, funny kid made me popular in school I went to. I used to love studying a lot since it was a way for me to not think about suicide or any other depressing idea and also a way to escape sleep since i had a lot of nightmares or sleepless nights which make me feel shitty for not being able to even sleep as everyone does, I also liked the whole school ambiance and i used to cry and hit myself, even self harm if i get a bad mark which is 17/20 or less, which now looking back at it isn't really a bad mark rather an excelent one, also not gonna lie my parents were strict about my studies since they always tell me that if I don't study I won't be able to afford food, home... since I am homelss and that everything they own is theirs not mine and also a part of me studied and worked hard from such a young age to study aboard specifically in Japan, I don't really have a pratical reason besides that i always loved that country, I also was confident in my answers not the I AM NVER WRONG but i at least if i found in a math test an answer i at least have a confidence in it, I used to always participate in class and wasn't ashamed to ask questions or asked them to repeat sth i couldn't understood, or when I get sth wrong, never skipped school even when I was sick and cried if my parents won't let me go because i was ill.

Ngl, I was never happy, never really felt overjoyed, I just studied worked hard, and in vaccation I either wrote poems or drew stuff and watch anime and read manga or sth.

''Surprinsingly'', I got too much confident the last year of high school. I did not study at all, just was there depressed, but somehow I was hoping to be the national to 5 graduates. I didn't study until one last month before my exam(to explain in where I live we have a test/exam in the end of your last year of highschool it's like the korean tests, so it obvi tell u if u can join a good college or not)and somehow I got a good mark it was a good average but I still did not reach my full potential, my whole surrounding was shocked, my parents were disapointed, I went in a mental breakdown, depression...even tho I've acted like I handled it. I already lost passion not only in studying but even in watching anime that was one of the reasons why I was alive.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I got ig lucky and joined the best college in my country where only smart and genius people go there, no one I know went there,so was alone, didn't make any friends because I just felt like I didn't belong there, I didn't seem to fit there, and also I didn't really have no desire to make friends, it's been two months that I've joined this college and my grades are still failling and the worst part is me not caring and wanting to die or become a rock.

I now became the one who wanted to sit with the smart kids to copy their answers, I no longer I'm the one who find the solutions but the one who still try to understand the solution in front of her, no longer preparing the lessons before we do it in class, I became the student that is clueless and doesn't know what we are doing, I am OUT, I don't even have enough confidence now, I last time got sth correct for some reason someone told me I am wrong and changed my answer right away, people no longer ask for my help in exercises and they don't even take me seriously when I ask them, I no longer particpate in class, no longer ask questions, I feel ashamed, I don't talk in class at all, I only observe those Geniuses, smart kids who are gonna became sth big one day, I really am not kidding when I say everyone is smart here, I am the dumbest in this school, I come at home and do nothing but surf here or read some mangas, or watch some uselles stuff while everyone is studying and working hard, I never attempted or thought about Suicide this much like these last few years. And of corse with me not studying it made my relationship with my parents got worse, where all you can hear is mom or dad or both of them screaming/yelling at me and me crying and telling them to leave me alone, mom always calls her mom and tell her that i am no longer studying, i really becae useless, I really tried to study but just can't focus, I really can no longer focus either in school or anywhere the only thing I am doing is thinking about suicide or leaving this country but I don't think that Japan will accept a loser scum of society like me, My exams are next week and I am gonna fail them since I don't even know what we are doing, Idk maybe I might try to study just for the shake of maybe this fucked up life will lead me or send me to Japan, either way I am gonna kill myself by thrwing myself in the Ocean hoping i will die in peace since it never worked, hung myself didn't work, overdosing on sleeping pills didn't work, cutting my wrists didn't work, trying to jump didn't work since some got involved, I tried everything but never worked, lol can't even end my life how much useless can I be?

I am gonna kill myself 09/09/2022 since I have to finish some stuff, I am set on killing myself, this isn't a cry for help but just me venting out in deffrent subreddit, I really am feeling nothing but emptiness, not gona blame anyone since I am the stupid bitch here, and honestly posting this here hoping that someone will see it so that somehow I will never be forgotten, I know this is stupid but I always wanted to change the world or invent/create a program or sth that will help/change the world and I now feel ashamed because I was too young to realize that at the end of the day I am dumb, stupid and useless.

&amp;#x200B;

Good bye world.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you won't forget me even tho I already know that this gonna be ignored.

fisgal87,2021-11-30 16:28:32+00:00,What does this sound like?,"Hello all,

I'm sat in a hospital waiting to see a Neurologist.

Few weeks ago I noticed pricking, tingling sensations all over my body. Not the first time it's happened- same thing occurred last year during a traumatic period due to health scares (including cancer) amongst others.

Symtpoms subsided after some days of vitamin b12 tablets.

A few weeks ago, they returned, prceedded by a significant drop in my mood.  I felt very low. 
 A week later I went on am amazing holiday I had been planning for months.  The symptoms pretty much vanished by say 98%. It was exactly what I needed. I thought this was behind me. 

 Returned  from holiday after 10 days and symptoms crept back.

Its been rough since then. My sister described me as ""having gone berserk"". I am so moody and erratic. I cry every single morning, sometimes multiple times a day. I wake you feeling so low, initially with my heart racing but that's improved now. I have no-one to speak to, they don't understand. 

I go through the entire day without eating and feel zero hunger pangs. No appetite. My blood sugar levels are low because of the prolonged fasting period. I eat only dinner primarily for sustenance. 

I go to bed straight after dinner. During happier  days I would watch TV shows. Now, can't be motivated to do so. 

The random tingling and pricking symptoms are definitely contributing to the decline in mt.mental state. It's more of a discomfort but the frustration of dealing (yet again) with something i don't understand is so nerve wracking amd depressing.  It feels like every month, a new health feat comes up depriving me of joy and peace.


I find myself crying constantly , daily which strangely enough gives me some relief. 

I'm seeing a psychologist this weekend and a neurologist today.

I long for peace and joy.

Regular_Plantain_975,2021-11-30 14:58:19+00:00,I don’t know what to do anymore,I’ve just decided whether consciously or subconsciously to give up on myself in life. I constantly feel useless and feel that I can’t do anything right. Most days I have to fight the urges I have to end my life. Every time I take one step forward in improving my life it feels like I take ten steps back. I hate my every birthday cause I feel I like I haven’t achieved anything in life and there is nothing to look forward. I never have hopes of my life getting better but I know it can always get worse somehow. 26M.
Responsible-Floor961,2021-11-30 13:56:24+00:00,33 [F4A] Australian looking for genuine friends. Prefer calls not texting,"Calls only please I struggle texting sometimes because of a prior head injury. 

Prefer someone that has dealt with mental illness as no matter how hard I try sometimes I can't hide it. 

Depression,  ptsd and anxiety/panic attacks. 

I'm very very down to earth,  kinda nerdy.  Like scifi etc. Old music and baking

Please keep topics PG. As I don't want to trigger my anxiety.

No I'm not looking for a bf. Just genuine friends. I don't care on gender or how you identify,  just so long as you can respect my boundaries and keep it pg. 

Prefer 25 or older as I'm 33 and it's hard for me to relate with anyone younger than this. Someone that is in a similar position as me with no friends or few friends would be good,  so we can keep in regular contact?"
Alert_Tomato50,2021-11-30 10:57:10+00:00,Depression is your body protecting you from past trauma( all trauma is big no small trauma btw),Hey guys I finally realized that I have been struggling with depression my whole life such a relief because I thought it was me causing the starting and stopping of jobs school etc. I found out that mine is linked to my childhood trauma I encourage everyone to find out about Gabor mate Peter levine that go deeper into this and how our child hood trauma dictates alot of our adult behavior and relationships and interactions with others and ourselves. I struggle with self soothing with alcohol and cocaine for a while but I always knew the substances where not the root issue but a symptom of a bigger problem. Now currently working out lightly and listening to heal trauma by Jess while I sleep off YouTube ( alot of healing is done in the subconscious) hope this helps someone else out there stay blessed and remember all dogs go to heaven and we are all just a bunch of golden retrievers masquerading as humans 🤪😘

Jaded_Asparagus_5676,2021-11-30 07:35:26+00:00,It was going soooo well..,"Not too long ago I turned 18 and it was the first birthday where I didn’t cry. I was genuinely happy. Not mellow, “not hanging in there”, simply happy. Which was so weird, didn’t feel real. Two months of content and calmness. But I didn’t realize after two months of being on auto pilot when it comes to school, i have finally fully and completely cracked. I fucked everything up. I can’t do anything. But now. After 2 months of not feeling those dark awful thoughts, they are back. 100% my fault. I slacked off in school, surprise surprise, and I’m just so completely and utterly lost. I don’t enjoy anything. I’ve never enjoyed school, something I just cannot do. But with no school.. what will I do? I’m just here. Nothing to me. What do I do? I’m trying so hard to calm down. I’m just ready to give up, completely shut down and somehow find a way to be here without being here. Just work a 9-5 for the rest of my life and just stay so my family can just know I’m here because I see no point of any of this. All of this is just some sort of joke."

i don’t know everyone’s stories, and i don’t know your different struggles, but i know that if you’re here, you’re probably dealing with something. Take care of yourselves.
my best of regards to you all."
Redditpirulin,2021-11-30 07:03:50+00:00,I think I'm depressed. Not entirely sure.,"I can't really talk to anyone about this because it's weird and I don't think I'd get much sympathy.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 31 years old and have a fantastic job. It's in the timeshare industry and I'm fantastic at what I do. I have my own house, car, etc. and bring home annually 120k to 150k depending on how my year went.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, I don't feel complete. Like, I know a lot of people see my life as a success but I'm bored. For example, at work everything is great. I'm a social butterfly and 90% of my work day consists of me vaping in the designated smoke spot, watching shows on netflix/surfing the internet and deciding what I'll be ordering for food that day. The other 10% is me actually working. I get away with murder on the job with my managers because of the numbers I produce.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, when I get home...I'm bored/lonely. I have a beautiful place with expensive furniture, expensive electronics, etc. yet I HATE being home. So I hang out with friends, drink, and get high.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I get high on? Cocaine. I do a stupidly large amount of cocaine every other day. Like, in a month my dumbass will spend about $800-$1000 on cocaine alone. It makes me feel better about myself. Like, I know I'm developing a problem but when it comes to me seeking it my thoughts are, ""Fuck it. It's not hurting me financially"" or ""Fuck it. Got nothing better to do"".

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like being stuck with my thoughts; I don't think of hurting myself at all but I don't feel fulfilled. I honestly feel like a failure despite the financial success I have.

&amp;#x200B;

Just posting into the void. Not sure what I expected out of this."

I've joined clubs and tried making more friends but...even all of that feels unreal to me. I feel so detached and don't feel happy at all doing anything anymore. I used to dress up but now I walk around in hoodies. 

I always feel tired. I can't sleep at all half the time. Then that makes me fall asleep after school, and now I'm awake at 12am doing all the homework I should have done earlier.

Every time I come home I burst out in tears. I feel so hopeless and feel like no one cares. It has been getting worse. I've reached out to friends and family about this....but they cant or just haven't chosen to care. No matter how tired or sad I look everyone just ignores it. 

Sometimes I can't even tell what the point of living is anymore. I used to love myself and what I did. Now I feel like I'm wasting away. I feel like nothing will ever get better because it hasn't the past couple years. I've always been a postive person, but now I'm ruined."

he doesn't care.

he's blocked me on everything, let's his gf harrass, threat and ruin my life. bitch legit deleted everything on my stuff and won't give my shit back.

all because of a stupid fight.

i can admit that i started that fight, but all they do is make fun of me and make me feel like shit, but i cant do the same or i'm a horrible person.

they've stolen money, scared the fuck out of me and done shit that i just can't stop remembering. but all she does is say it's all in my head"" or ""i'm making it all up"".

but he does nothing about it, he just agrees.

he doesn't care about me. he never fucking has. but i care about him so much, no matter what he does, but i guess that doesn't fucking matter because i'm just a disappointment, aren't i?

that's all i'll ever fucking be to him.

i can't even talk to him, or hang out with him, with or without his gf anymore and i fucking hate it. i wish i was fucking dead.

like, yeah, i'm a bad person, but i'm trying so hard not to be, and they don't give a fuck. i'm just a disgusting human being no matter what i fucking do.

sadpinkgirl,2021-11-30 03:10:28+00:00,The Definition of Depression,Depression is basically waking up everyday and wondering why you’re still alive and questioning every single day when are you finally going to die. Hoping each and every single day that you didn’t have to exist in this awful world that you don’t belong in and wondering just how much longer do you have to feel like this… it’s literal torture and I’m so over it. I truly wish I could just die already.

But I’ve just noticed over the past few weeks that out of all of us my problems and struggles aren’t taken nearly and seriously as the rest of them.

I’m not very good at explaining or talking about my feelings but does anyone kinda relate to this?

LumiGloomy,2021-11-30 00:29:43+00:00,I hate the mall,"I’ve always hated the mall it’s an uncomfortable place, it’s crowded and I always feel watched. I’m not brave enough to go into the stores I like, I don’t have an income to even buy anything anyway. And there’s teens and young adults everywhere. I’m intimated by them because they’re a reminder of everything I didn’t have and still don’t. But today I hate the mall for a different reason. All the clothes on display were for petite, skinny girls who can show their stomachs without issues. It’s a size I’ll never be and I don’t even know if I want to be. 

I don’t know if I actually hate the mall if or I hate that it’s a trigger for my insecurities. I’ve just been noticing I’ve gained weight recently and it’s bothering me. My only solution to losing it is limit my intake. So recently I’ve been having 2 proper meals a day and lots of sweets. If I changed some of that I would have a good diet. I would be eating like my body needs me to be. But now I’ll cut that intake completely in half, maybe even skip days altogether. Just because doing the proper healthy way to maintain your weight is so much harder than this."

The last few years have felt like a downward spiral of failure and shame and I can’t help but blame myself for every single stumble. I have a lot of reasons to despise ADHD, inferiority complex, confusion over my gender and sexuality, social anxiety, and my inability to structure my life, stay medicated and find independence from my parents who I leech off of them and lie to them repeatedly about my mental state. With that came resentment of my twin brother and friends for having their lives together while I dug my own grave. It hurt to say it out loud and I left the session feeling worse than before."

I constantly feel like I'm taking advantage of my employer but I'm not intentionally doing so, and my partner she is amazing and I constantly feel like I'm letting her down too.

I've had a pretty messy life but I don't complain, I e survived cancer and an intestinal defect, and a thyroid imbalance, now this current un-diagnosed heart problem.

I'm just fed up with struggling and hoping to be normal the next day, and feeling guilty to my partner and daughter and my employer.

While not being depressed is not an option on too many occassions, then there's no way I'm gonna find my motivation to keep me away from being depressed, which concluded as a 'no way out' for me.

Forgotten until I was raped in 2019 by someone I went to school with. Who stalked me. Raped me in my sleep. Broke a rib in my sleep. Just hurt me. I had a miscarriage. All of this I am still mourning over. 
I got into a car accident in 2020. Broke my leg. It was due to the stress. 

Then my mom died this year. It's been rough the last past three years.. 

In any case.. I don't feel like I am good enough for anyone. I was almost kidnapped as a child. I was molested by the kidnapper as well as family members. 

Like..

Idk. 
I feel fucked up, broken and not wanted. The rapist and his gang friends as doctors, etc seem to prove to me that I am undesirable and unwanted.. 

I've been to therapy. It doesn't really help get rid of the pain and hurt. I have huge trust issues towards people now. I feel extremely disconnected. 

I get it. I am not the smartest, the prettiest, the sexiest nor the skinnest woman in the world.. I have some value... Right? It doesn't feel like it. 

I feel like my dreams of being married and having a husband with kids is never going to happen. My heart has gotten me into too much trouble it seems with men and women even where I got hurt in the end.. 

I don't know how to get back to normal in life in regards to tidying up my home and staying healthy.. I feel like I just give up on life.."

redasfuckk,2021-11-28 17:25:25+00:00,am I making it up?,"I'm on fluoxetine 30mg. I still sleep all day. I can't brush my teeth regularly, I've needed 3 surgeries because of the decay. My hair is ruined, I can't brush it regularly and it all snaps when I do eventually brush it. I feel so hopeless.

i don't know what to do. the medication clearly isn't working, I've been on it for 6 months but im scared that I'm making it up, I read that anti depressants have no effect on non depressed people, so maybe this is why its not helping??

I don't know what to do I'm so sick of this, it's been too many years."
Bigj0123,2021-11-28 16:53:31+00:00,Depressed and don't know what to do?,"1st off, thanks  in advance for taking the time to read this  long post, give me help and advice in advance 

I'm in a little bit of a pickle and I do not know what to do?

So my dad is in rehab for physical therapy because he's not able to walk at the moment. He's been there for about a week now and I've been going there pretty much every day since he's been there. One of the first few days that he was there, I  ended up fracturing my left foot and ankle and if you want to know what happened, feel free to ask and I'll tell you (confirmed with x-rays by an urgent care doctor and then a follow up with new x-rays at an orthopedic doctor). Which so far If I take Tylenol every 4 hours I'm able to walk on it and have no pain. It's just that I walk slow and a little bit weird for now, but that's it and I have to walk a little bit at least because I'm home by myself. So I have to at least take a shower, take my dog for a walk, go to see my dad (which I've been even going and getting him food and bringing it to him as well).

Well the last  day and a half my foot has been having pain even when I take Tylenol, I'm sitting down, elevate my foot and put ice on my foot (witch If I take Tylenol and then lay down in the bed it seems to be okay though). Today I've been having a really rough time taking a shower, taking my dog for a walk. I'm getting inflamed pain and I'm having to sit down and wait at least about 40 min-an hour to recuperate.  Also, I seem very tired, out of it and seem to have a sore throat and like a stuffy dehydrated head even if I drink plenty of water. I'm unable to do anything today and my dad is expecting me to bring him some food and some mineral water like  Perrier or Pellegrino. Also my dad is getting mad at me. If I do not come which then in turn makes me feel guilty even though I'm going through the worst that I possibly could be going through at home medically

Then to add more fuel to the fire. My dad had has been verbally treating me like garbage when all I do is help him including when I have a has been verbally treating me like garbage when all I do is help him, including when I have multiple fractures (he thinks I'm okay and asking me to do things like I don't have any fractures as well).  To add even more fuel to the fire now, his secretary ordered him a new wine refrigerator for his wine, because there's some expensive wine leaking and he thinks it's the cooler because he's not here (even though I'm telling him I need one of his friends who's the wine specialist to come and look at the bottles). So Amazon brought it upstairs, but they left in the middle of my condo hallway near my door (and people have a hard time passing through). The building has complained about it, and I asked them to have people come and move it inside for me while I take care of getting rid of it (supposably Amazon is coming tomorrow to pick it up with a new shipping label that they have), and I would have gave whoever helped me a good tip. Which we have no space in apartment to even put it in there temporarily, but I would make room for a day. It's like everyday my dad adds more fuel to the fire. Like he wants to go home when he can't physically walk, saying how he's going to sign himself out against medical advice and then putting it on me to take care of him with a fracture and I need at least 2 months of not supposed to be walking at all before I can even consider it healed. The him arguing with me,  coming me he wants to go home against medical advice and wants me to take care of him when I have multiple fractures, or like today when a  refrigerator randomly shows up  at the front door. It's like everyday my dad adds more fuel to the fire for no reason.

With all this being said, I feel really depressed in general because of these issues going on. But today I really do not know what to do and I feel bad because if I don't go to my dad I feel guilty, but at the same time I'm physically injured and physically feeling sick. Then on top of it I have to deal with the refrigerator and getting it removed and I don't want to leave because the building is complaining. So I just do not know what to do? And I have absolutely no one else to talk to except coming here.  Which I've been feeling very depressed because of all this. So I told my dad that if he doesn't treat me like garbage, doesn't add these things like the refrigerator showing up randomly without telling me, saying are you want to come home and you're going to sign yourself out and saying how I'm abandoning him because I don't pick him up to take you home  against medical advice when I have multiple fractures.  Then I would be in a semi good een with my fractures and everything my dad is going through with  being at rehab."

ThinMintress,2021-11-28 14:18:14+00:00,Where I’m from you can choose to end your life if terminally ill . Why is that not possible for mental illness ?,It’s never going to get better. Actually it keeps getting worse I’m just getting better at hiding it. I’ve been on every antidepressant known to man and nothing works. Or it will work for a while then stop. I’m alone and no one cares. I’ve isolated myself from everyone else because I don’t have the energy to pretend everything is OK and be happy. I don’t know what to do anymore. All I can think about from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed is ending it . I don’t want to try anymore I’m tired. I don’t belong in society. I just want out . The only thing keeping me here is the fear I wouldn’t succeed. That’s it. So why in this type of situation can’t I have the choice of saying when enough is enough? If I had cancer that wouldn’t get better I would be allowed to make that choice. Why can’t I hear? Why is it selfish to no longer want to suffer?  If I truly don’t belong in society or with other people why do I have to be here? I feel like I’m dying anyway. Just rotting from the inside. Why should I have the same right  a terminally ill person does to  have a humane and peaceful ending? Enough’s enough

Now I’m homeless and I can’t get a job. Something soon might come up, but without family or friends to vent to about working a shit job, I won’t keep it for too long. Can’t go out to meet new people because I’ve got trauma and I don’t believe in people anymore, so I remain all alone

I don’t see a way out"

I'm too afraid to leave my abusive home m have no where to go anyway all the shelters are full.

I hear things like no one loves you off your self hope you die can't wbore bitch shut on a daily basis. I don't have friends   I'm seriously considering just going homeless.  My doc won't sign off on my disability paperwork.
dap2danny,2021-11-28 11:04:56+00:00,Depressed since weeks now and I cannot snap out of this shit like usual,"I wake up - Sad
I am at work and as soon as I am not occupied - sad
I drive home - sad
I sit on my couch and literally do nothing but be sad or roll another joint to have 30 minutes of not thinking about anything. But then it just comes back.

Normally I would have maybe a day once in while where I'd feel like this but it's been weeks this time and I just don't know who to talk to.

By brothers have their own things to deal with and I have barely any friends left to talk to. I work 6 days a week and haven't seen ""new people"" for ages except for customers at work. 

I would really love to feel happiness again. I know how it feels like and I absolutely miss it. 

I miss just being excited about something, enjoying something like It's a first time or just not looking at everything's downside which mainly caused people around me to get this ""Did he really just say something that dark?"" Looks in their faces. 

This can't stay like this! This isn't who I am.

I was the guy that did his best to make others laugh and live off their laughs and happy faces and now I am the guy that has an expression in his face that makes people ask me ""Are you okay?"" after a few seconds into a conversation.


Last Friday my company had the annual ""Weihnachtsfeier"" ( Company comes together and eats and drinks at the end of the year, common thing to do a few weeks before Christmas in Germany) 
Usually I would take the younger co-workers and apprentices on some kind of night threw Frankfurt and be the main energy to initiate although staying sober so I could drive them to the clubs and bring them home safely. I would have even more energy than people that had been tipsy or more.
Usually...
Instead , because my energy wasn't there, it took no time for the first people to leave after they had eaten. There was no vibes whatsoever to grab some drinks or do anything together. It ended with me locking the company doors at 10pm. - normally this ended at 5am In the morning with me dropping off the last person at their home and feeling great. 

Instead I locked those doors and fealt like crying.


I am not asking for advice actually, I just needed some place to drop this. 

*sending hugs to you all*"
Cowboybanana288,2021-11-28 06:43:20+00:00,Can someone just kidnap me and let me start a new life?,"Sometimes, I want someone to just abduct me and take me far away from my old life and let me live a new life. Its similar to faking my own death but I still want that sense that if I feel unsure suddenly or have withdrawls I can come back. Its the same amount of hurt for others who may or may not care about me but atleast theres hope that I'm still alive. 

I don't have a happy life, and I really don't like how much longer I can go on living like this. I feel trapped or stuck and I just want to get out for feel some sense of freedom but its just so difficult, I've had like 4 different therapists already and they were all just temporary because I can only afford to get a therapist through college. I fantasize about having someone just come take and far away and I can just live a new life, instead of trying to find my way back home I can live somewhere new and start all over. I would change my identity or just stay under their roof and just live as I please. I just wish life was easier, and no words of comfort can help me anymore. I just wanna run away."
BringBackTheMagic,2021-11-28 05:53:55+00:00,It constantly feels like a demon in my skull is trying to push my brain through my eye sockets.,And this makes me want to blow my brains out the back of my skull with a double barreled sawed-off  shotgun.

Environmental-Fig89,2021-11-28 03:39:42+00:00,I'm depressed but don't want to go for help because I know it will end with me being on meds,"On both sides of my family it seems everyone has either extreme anxiety, depression or both. I feel like it starting to affect me. Everyone in my immediate family is on some sort of anti depressant right now except for me. 

For ever until now I wasn't convinced that I was or could be depressed. I always thought it was lazy people complaining about how difficult their lives are. I still somewhat believe that because of how trendy it is.

Fml. I feel like I shouldn't be writing this. My life is nothing but a blessing. I live in a middle class family in north America. I got through high school and into university. I have a nice car. I have a nice computer. I'm in a position where I'm theoretically set for life. Hence why I feel like a whinny little bitch typing on my fancy computer about how much I think my life sucks because of my emotional state. Every day there's a point where I lose all hope for the world and ask myself why I shouldn't kill myself. It happens too much. I spend my days in a sad state. Video game, TV, the internet, nothing works to distract me from the reality that I'm doomed. Nothing interests me anymore I have no ambition I have no care in the world for anything. Anything that makes me feel slightly good I abuse until all good is milked dry and it becomes a reminder of how pathetic I am as a man. A supposed mad. If I was one i wouldn't be here complaining to some online forum about how my life ""sucks"". 

I know I need to fix this but the only solution is one that I don't like the idea of that is medication. Idk what it is but I hate the idea. I makes you a completely different person despite what others tell me. Its what you take when your such a screw up you cant fix your own problem. whats the point in living when your not living. Its like your someone else. A person everyone else wants you to be. A person that thinks there happy however they cant think past all the bad things to see their life is idm what im trying to say. My mental state is fucked. Im degenerate in my thoughts. I love the sad feeling while knowing that the way of thinking is terrible for me. I love listening to sad music and being sad with it. idk what too think. 

Writing this makes me angry because its essentially therapy. reading over what i've written and realizing iot doesnt make sense. Therapy is the same. someone questions the logic of your reasoning until you realize your a retard for thinking in such a destrictive way."

I just feel empty all the time and numb towards everything. Nothing brings me joy just sleeping and weed I don’t care about anything else. The only reason why I even have a full time job is because I am too afraid to kill myself so I’ll never actually attempt that so I have no other choice but to keep surviving this miserable life I never asked for until I’m finally dead… currently at work on my lunch thinking about how much I don’t wanna be here. Thanks for hearing me out you guys."

Prehistoric_Lama,2021-11-28 01:08:03+00:00,My best friend said it hurts him to see me suffer.,"I’ve been through a lot, and last year I’ve met someone in college, at first we weren’t that much friends, we rarely talked, about thrice a week at max, but I don’t know why, probably because I couldn’t keep it to myself anymore, I told him about my crippling depression and suicidal thoughts.

Towards the end of the year, he started telling me about some personal stuff that he didn’t share with others, I told him the reasons behind my emptiness and anhedonia, the principal reason being that a girl used me to get to someone else and then broke me emotionally before moving on, he was supportive but couldn’t do much.

During summer, he told me about a girl who used him back in high school and that kind of issues, so I told him everything that has happened to me since I was still in middle school, we became close friends, and even though he knows that this girl used me because of a mutual friend who he was close too, he never let me down, but I had to quit social media because I couldn’t stand some people anymore.

As this year started, I did what was best for my mental health, which was avoiding everyone, after some time we crossed paths and he asked me why I disappeared, so I told him why, and since then we’ve been talking from time to time, he advised me to try finding another girl to maybe get out of this dark place I’m in, which lead me yo admit that I kinda liked a girl but I know I have no chances with her so I won’t try.

He said that he could see his best friend in such agony anymore, that it was painful to watch, that I needed to find a girl who genuinely care about me and who will make me able to become myself again because I deserve to be happy.

It surprised me to know that I was somebody’s best friend, I never expected that, I want to follow his advice but reality is I’m scared of getting hurt again, I don’t want to be used and played anymore, I don’t want to go through that type of pain anymore, I’m already broken and won’t be able to handle being treated so badly again, that’s why I decided to end up alone, that’s how it is."
smith_and_jones4ever,2021-11-28 00:57:47+00:00,I am depressed because my life is meaningless on the scale of importance on this planet,"Out of all the people alive right now there is a gradient scale of significance. I think it would be based on how many lives are affected by a person's actions. It would be impossible to calculate but it definitely exists. And it's probably really dumb.  
But for me I think I'm probably low on the scale, or abyss. I don't know if things would be better if they were the opposite though. People have been killed by the paparazzi so maybe I'm actually lucky.   


I dk what I'm getting at but I'm very sad and not doing as well as I should be. Although I often feel hypercritical when I'm actually doing my best. Perception is such a weird thing. How can it change the way it does? and what are emotions?  
I hate the feeling that wants to be recognized for character because that is the opposite of what personality is. Being superficial like that is repulsive and obvious. 

  
Ok I'll stop there but if you want me to talk your ear off about the vague ideas that make me depressed HMU. It'll be fun I swear."
bigT773,2021-11-27 23:20:54+00:00,What do you do in a situation like this,"I have been depressed for the past 6 or so years, but that isn't the main point of focus, the point is and not to sound like a cringey person (I'm actually not sure what is the correct word to use in this case) but what do you do when you've reached the point where you can't be the nice guy anymore, the one who does things for the sake of the greater good, the one who doesn't even put himself last and just completely forgets about himself

This sounds really stupid but I geniunely feel like this is the point in my villian arc, yknow the point in which I go from good with sadness in my heart to just pure hatred and anger and rage

I used to have a lot of love in my heart for many things even if I was depressed but now, I just despise everything, nothing seems to work, I want to end my life so bad and I even set a date but I don't even know if I can go through with it anymore, there are people who care about me and stuff but that doesn't matter when you just can't stand yourself and anyone around you

I sound bitter and awful but isn't that what the world is, I used to be so bright and sunshiney as a kid but then I don't know what happened, even before I turned 18 which is how old I am as I'm writing this, I absaloutely adored and cherished many things even if I had suicidal thoughts and anger and rage, this isn't even the bipolar part of me talking, this is just me speaking out of my own sake

What happens when your passion, compassion, love, adoration and beauty in your eyes fades away and turns into disgust and rage and anger and bitterness"
TormodRN,2021-11-27 22:49:50+00:00,Worst day of my life,"My dog is dying....

He is my bestfriend through 9-17years old. He most likely wont make it to my 18th birthday. He is so important to me that he have made me cry 3 out of the 6/7 times i rememver crying. I dont really like to cry or most situations not able to cry. He has been in my ups and downs/happiness and sad times/ Therapist and my buddy. I love that dog more than anyone else. He has had multiple seizures this months because some medical reason i dont know yet. It can be one of two things and the one where he dies is the most likely.

I root for him having the second option cuz then he can still maybe live 1 or 2 more years but even then its too soon for him to go. Im not ready yet and never will be.

Get well Theo (doggo)

Depression runs in my family and let’s just say it didn’t skip me. With the holidays here I thought I’d feel some joy but I feel so down, alone, and invisible. This is my first holiday with my family in years, my brother is in the military and this is his first time home in 10 years! So I was excited and nervous starting this trip. At first it was great, I was happy. But a few days in and as more people came to visit I kind of just vanished. Like literally we went out to eat yesterday and I got up with my son to show him a Christmas movie and not one person acknowledged me. We were at the restaurant for hours and no one spoke to me. Granted I have two small kids I was taking care of, but when did children become invisibility cloaks? Anyways, I’m not sure if it’s the depression, or if I’m socially awkward, or just so used to being with children but since I’m already invisible, I wish I could just disappear."

I've always felt that my parents and family members used me as an example so that they won't mess up with the other kids.. I'm not allowed to have my own choices... An example my mom and a family forced me to pick a subject to which I was not particularly good with and discouraged me of continuing art something which is something i love doing... hopefully my father was able to talk them out.... Another example my maths arent that great they put pressure on the younger ones so that they wont be a failure like me...  Now this year they put me in a strict school against my wishes and they even forced me doing maths and forbid me of doing another subject i enjoyed doing. Now im pretty sure if i fail this class and have to take it... Im sure they're gonna blame me for everything... I get the feeling the choose the worse choices for me and then take better choices for the others.. I just don't like my life it feels they've stolen my teen life... The others are able to do stuff that I wasnt allowed to do back then when I was their age.... When ever I bring up the topic of what I want to do once I've completed school they're like ""Dont worry about these trivial stuff we've already chosen what you're gonna do later on."" I dream of doing something related to art but im sure that they're gonna steal this dream from me and let the others do it.. Im just sad. This is a vent, I'm sorry if its quite unclear im tryna write everything.. I want to cool myself and I'm apologizing for the bad English.. Its not my first language."

I moved here 16 years ago from West Africa I was 16 at the time. I have always struggled with mental health but in Africa they call it ""being difficult"" but the abuse from my mother only created more friction and internal trauma as it did not curve the behavior. Fast forward to the Canada move mother throws me out on the streets of Toronto within the first 6 months in the country. I love my mother and know she was only doing the best she knew with what she knew but this has created anxiety and depression that I have struggled with my adult life. I have been homeless 3 times over the past 3 years but I continue to fight and grow. I was able to self cure/therapy my anxiety away last year but now figured what I also had was depression and learnt it is heavily linked to trauma. I was hoping someone had a good old phone because they are getting a new one this holiday season they could send me(l have a phone but it is an Alcatel lol). I want to use it to document my journey this year. I want to open the world to learning more about depression and anxiety and it's heavy links to child hood trauma. I also want to show that depression is not an external syndrome but internal. Also if you have a good old laptop or pad I would take that too. If you read this far thank you for taking the time. I hope you are doing amazing but if your in pain I pray you too find healing like I have so your journey in this life is much smoother. Look into Peter levine and Gabor mate they saved my life.

I want to do something important, but it's hard to do when you live in a small town in Iraq/Kurdistan, even ISIS tried to take over. basically dreams are fucking dead here, people here immigrants in  Belarus rn. 

there is so much knowledge on the internet but idk what I want to do or learn or what is worth learning on the internet? I dont want to waste any more of my time

Im also tired of chasing people or girls, or making people ""my only goal"" I know there is more important things than chasing people.

I'm still 20, having no friends, my conversations are all one sided, no one puts any effort into me but I do put effort into others, maybe I'm not good enough?

my only goal is to finish school. because I have no other goals yet

I like soccer, science, astrology, movies, philosophy, psychology, history. 

or I spend time texting girls online who I dont know or watching porn. I hate doing those but I'm obsessed. I'm tired of wasting my time 


which kills my motivation to study. I want to do something to break this infinite cycle


I know my only goal in life should be self improvement but idk where to start. 

read books? meditate? how are those gonna change my life?"

I work with my therapist every week, but it’s so hard to do coping methods when I’m too tired to try, and most of them don’t work. 
It’s literally a battle in my mind. Everyday I find something to live for. And this sounds bad, but I’m sick of it. I’m sick of having reasons to live when I just want to die 
I don’t want to self-harm, I don’t want to lay in bed all day, I don’t want to be depressed. But really, it’s all I’ve known. So how do I even picture being happy and having joy?

Maleficio4,2021-11-27 05:41:35+00:00,my depression feels so heavy,"I've been depressed most of my life. I've managed by staying busy, putting a lot of things on my plate so that I don't have time to think. Since the pandemic started last year my job went completely remote. Since then I've noticed my mental health decline more and more every day. I got to be so distant and depressed that my fiance left me two weeks ago. Now she's not even talking to me. I see everything that I did wrong and it just hurts so much to think about it. I didn't want to be distant like that I just couldn't help it. She's the love if my life and I feel like I just will not be able to recover from this. I try to distract myself and not think about but the feelings just rush in out of nowhere and I can't breathe, I just cry and don't know what to do now."
Intrepid-Drive3430,2021-11-27 04:18:08+00:00,"""Communication Is Key"" ...yeah okay.","""You need to communicate in order for others to understand how you're feeling!"" Oh really? What happens when you actually do that? People find out how you really feel. How scary your darkest thoughts can REALLY be. You add an extra burden on their shoulders ontop of everything else they're dealing with. 'What do I say? How do I react? Will my reaction set them off? I didn't ask for this...' no one knows how dark my thoughts ACTUALLY become at times. No one. Not my parents. Not my best friend. Not my partner of 9 years. Not my therapists... 

It's just easier to keep up the facade. Healthy? No. Easy? Yes. For me, and for everyone else. To just say I'm okay...I might not be...but I've learned over the years that if I say I'm not, it just becomes more exhausting versus just saying ""no nothings wrong, i swear."" They don't want to deal with my emotions. I. Don't want to deal with my emotions. Why do you think I've tried so many concoctions of anti-depressants? 

Yes, I've been to therapy. Yes, I've been to MULTIPLE therapists. Yes, I've been on medication, tried different medications, exercise, diet, change of environment, you name it. 

I'm exhausted. I'm sure everyone I've met is exhausted. My parents. My friends... My partner...I know they know somethings wrong....but I'm just so tired....tired of this cycle...tried of being sad, getting help, feeling better, and falling once again...and bringing everyone else down with me. 

I'm not looking for pity or advice. Just a place where I can remain anonymous and not cause anymore worry to my friends and family. 

Thanks."

Instead of spending one more second in a household of non stop abuse, stress, and trauma especially over the last 6 years. After another fight with my sister who has no respect for anyone when she is with a guy. She tells me that I act like it’s my house and I’m big and bad then should do the dishes. (I take out the trash most times, I pay for the cable, power, and now heat.) and that I do nothing. I was going to throw her stuff out because she is tired of being cramped in a two bedroom town with 5 people in it. (The only reason she is currently living here with her 3 children is because of her actions.) My mom comes up stairs yelling at me acting like that in front of the kids. Even though it’s my sister who has caused them to see and experience just as much if not worst then we did growing up. Not to mention I spent last two hours driving for my mom listening to bitch about my sister because mom can’t let things go.

This question is not 'really' for people who genuinely like being in their own company, this question is for people who have endured loneliness, whether it be  extreme to the point of talking to yourself since you were 5 or just not having anyone around for a lengthy period of time.

I want to list all my very important reasons for asking this question because I really want people to take the time out of their day to answer mindfully and truthfully. However, this post should not have anything to do with me, I'm solely interested in people's responses, please don't keep anything back.

How long have you been lonely? What isolated you? Do you prefer life this way? If you could have anyone at your side who would it be? How do you cope with lonliness on a daily basis?"

egirly22_,2021-11-26 23:25:56+00:00,Venting,"I feel like I’ve gotten really good at wearing masks. Masks that hide my actual emotions. Masks that protect me from being hurt. Lately I’ve been wearing a mask and little did I know how much pain I’ve been in until I decided to take it off. Alright, enough with the metaphors. I grew up surrounded by a whole lot of dysfunction disguised as “love”. My parents have never been great at showing it because their parents weren’t. My parents have said some pretty evil things to me. Assassinated my character, called me worthless. But like the flip of a switch, they change. Out of nowhere, they start being nicer. Notice how I never mention that they ever apologize. They say what they want without much care, then switch up as if that counts for anything close to an apology. The cycle goes like this: I mess up, they get angry, they last out, they then switch up. Apologies don’t exist. I’ve grown to become conditioned to verbal abuse, I’ve grown to tolerate it. I’ve grown to feel as though I deserve it. Fast forward to my early teens. The earliest memories I have of relationships at the 16-18 age range are of nothing but straight up abuse. It took someone else outside my life to make me realize that it even was abuse. In my mind at the time I used to believe that it was okay if he hit me, so long as he apologized. Or so long as I wasn’t “doing something to upset him”. I used to believe it was okay for him to call me worthless, ugly, and weak. Clearly I did something to deserve it. Right? The harem of abusive relationships I’ve been in taught me that love seems to come at a price. That love comes with pain. I started to learn from these painful situations that in order to protect myself, I needed to hide myself away. Keep my emotions at bay. Never allow myself to feel any “big” or “unpleasant” emotions. Always wear the mask, never let it slip. Never let anybody truly see you. That’s how you keep yourself safe. Or so that’s what Ive always thought. I’ve been feeling some very “big and unpleasant” emotions as of late. 

And I’ve done very well to keep them hidden. Safe and sound under my mask. But I can’t hold it in anymore. All of the thoughts I’ve been so terrified to be let known I’ve finally decided to let them come to the surface. I give so much love to everyone in my life but I feel like it’s so seldom reciprocated. I give the love I so desperately wish I received. To say I feel alone would be a severe understatement. It hurts me so badly. So so badly to feel like nobody really cares. It hurts to feel like nobody will ever truly choose me. It hurts to feel like people only choose to be near me out of pity. Or because they want something. It breaks my heart to think that no matter how much someone tells me they love me, I will forever question it. It hurts to feel like I have a lot of “friends” but none of them really know me. It hurts to feel like I’m always at the risk of losing someone, knowing full well I can’t do anything to stop them. It hurts beyond reason to feel like I will always come last to the people I care about the most. It breaks me to feel like there’s no way out of this. I’m spiraling. It’s happening in plain sight and no one can tell. All I want is to feel like I’m loved. All I want is to be able to be who I am truly and have someone love me despite it. All I want is to know what it is to be loved without pain. All I want is to be able to trust people. Without the constant fear of being abused if I get too close. To know love without pain. I wish I knew what that was like. To not fear taking off the mask."
throwaway91818122,2021-11-26 23:15:24+00:00,So lonely it's painful,"Hey, first off, thanks for taking the time to read.

For a long time, I've felt extremely lonely. I have a boyfriend, yet I still feel lonely. I crave friendship, but I fear I am never going to experience true friendship again because its harder to make friends as an adult. Is it selfish to want this? My boyfriend has so many friends, yet I have none. It feels so easy for him. 

A lot of people on this sub seem like they have it much worse off, but I still feel so much pain. I don't want to rely on my boyfriend for all my social interaction. I appreciate him so much, but its not the same.

I want to meet new people, yet I have no where where I can do so (just trust me on this). Also, where I work, 99 percent of the time I am alone. 

I feel like the best years are behind me, like it's not possible to make true friends anymore. When people are adults, they stop caring about stuff like that or something, I don't know. I feel like no one has time for anything anymore. I value true friendship so much and I just wish I could meet some new people, but it seems so impossible right now. And then, is anyone even looking for that? Do they even care? 

Some people just care about relationships, but I also want friendships to call my own. I never seem to be able to keep friends nowadays. Is this what being an adult is like? 

If it is, I think that really sucks and makes me super sad :( I dunno I can't stop crying just thinking about it. I always feel so alone (yes I am know I'm not alone alone, but it still feels like that). 

Am I ungrateful for feeling like that? I don't know what else to really say."

I dont know why, and I cant even be sure that that's what I'm feeling as I have a hard time identifying my emotions. But even if things are great, afterwards I just feel... heavy? I cried myself to sleep because of it, I don't even know why I was crying. 

Now I have to clean my house, make rolls (because my husband's family insists I become a domesticated house wife and refuses to let me just buy some rolls), and then do it all over again with my husband's family, which make me feel a different kind of heavy or guilty or whatever, sad. But I just feel exhausted and incapable and sad. 

I haven't felt this depressed since high-school. Idk what to do. All I want to do is sleep but it won't come. Now I have to spend the day alone cleaning while my husband's at work, and nothing sounds fun or good or even acceptable. I just wish I didn't exist right now which I know is dramatic.

If I don't give them my work then they hit me, punch me,slap me and I can't do nothing about it as they are more stronger than me and if I tell a teacher then they would again call me childish. My best friend also isn't my best friend whom i can trust anymore, he always tells my secrets as i trust him to everyone else and also slaps and hits me for no reason. These tears are very hard to hold especially as it happens everyday. I try to have positive vibes but can't because of them. I can't do anything against them as they will blackmail me and still do to tell my secrets. My other friend who tries to act like the group leader evern though he isn't and my best friend also tries to gain his attention all times and tries to lower all ties with me everytime. The so called group leader also makes so lame jokes but everyone in the group laughs and it's such a forced laugh it's obvious. I don't think about suicide as that would disappoint my parents as they expect things from me and have spend money on me and I can't make it go to waste. I am fucked"

rebel-98,2021-11-25 11:01:10+00:00,I smoke to cope with my depression,"Hi .. 

Does anyone else starts smoking whenever he feels depressed ?? 

I suffer from depression from time to time and I think about committing suicide sometimes .. my life sucks .. I always try to convince my self that suicide is not the answer to anything .. I never showed any weakness in front of people .. I always have to act like everything is ok .. Like I am a tough guy who is happy and content with his life .. 

I have so many reasons why I don’t want to kill myself .. I love my family and I really want to continue living .. sometimes I wish I was never born but that does not mean I want my life to end .. 

However .. Whenever I feel extremely depressed and overwhelmed with my life .. I satisfy this urge to hurt my self with smoking .. it just makes me feel better .. with every breath I take from my cigarette I know I am hurting my body but not the point of killing my self .. this is my coping mechanism .. it is the thing that keeps me from total insanity !"
The__Time,2021-11-25 10:06:12+00:00,I just want to feel…something.,"Here’s a song that really hit me. No, I’m not dying, but at the age where I feel irrelevant. Like I’m just here to fulfill a role and other people’s expectations. My wants and desires are shut down. My wife cannot support herself due to medical issues and I’ll never throw her away like garbage. She’s a good woman. But where do I fit in all this? When do I count? 

Do you dream
That the world will know your name?
So tell me your name.
And do you care
About all the little things?
Or anything at all?
I want to feel
All the chemicals inside.
I want to feel.
I want a sunburn
Just to know that I'm alive.
To know I'm alive.
And don't tell me if I'm dying
'Cause I don't want to know.
If I can't see the sun
Maybe I should go.
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming
Of angels on the moon.
Where everyone you know
Never leaves too soon.
And do you believe
In the day that you were born?
Tell me do you believe?
And do you know
That every day's the first
Of the rest of your life?
And don't tell me if I'm dying
'Cause I don't want to know.
If I can't see the sun
Maybe I should go.
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming
Of angels on the moon.
Where everyone you know
Never leaves too soon.
This is to one last day in the shadows.
And to know a brother's love.
This is to New York City angels
And the rivers of our blood.
This is to all of us.
To all of us.
So don't tell me if I'm dying
'Cause I don't want to know.
If I can't see the sun
Maybe I should go.
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming
Of angels on the moon.
Where everyone you know
Never leaves too soon.
Yeah you can tell me all your thoughts
About the stars that fill polluted skies.
And show me where you run to
When no one's left to take your side.
Don't tell me where the road is
'Cause I just don't want to know.
No I don't want to know.
And don't tell me if I'm dying.
Don't tell me if I'm dying.

-117013,2021-11-25 02:54:17+00:00,My mom just said that all her expectations on me are gone now,"I've been struggling with depression for almost 2 years. Long story short, Used to be that one kid who knows what to do in life and all. Meaninglessness took my motivation in anything. Psyciatriats said they are sorry to be unable to help and stuff just to ignore me. Got really close to suicide. Somehow still here, a little better. Get myself homeschooled, never ever had opened a single book for almost 4 months. Getting away from school helped me a lot but parents dont think so. I'm always talking with them about it and there still is no way to convince them. They are just too ignorant and stupid. I already made my decision (giving a break to school and still not ready for uni). Dad most of the times neutral, mom is too toxic to handle. She's working hard geting home late but when she comes back home she makes my life unbearable. Never had been this toxic, she sometimes is sweet but like... Uhh. So the biggest problem is I have no will to do anything but had to get rid of this house, so had to earn money. Living in a small town and still 17 so finding a real!? Job is quite impossible. I'm REALLY trying to lower my expectations on me especially to myself but i always find myself in this shithole struggling. Have no passion no will to live. My self confidence ruined. Mom made my day really so hard for me. Feeling like shit and hatefull."

Or the more you talk about it the more sad or tired you get? Idk. I’m at that moment and I’ve been there for too long. I know it seems selfish, but nothing makes me happy anymore. I’m a medical assistant and I’m 21. I should be out living my life and having fun since I’m young and have an okay job but I can’t bring myself to do anything anymore. Every week I get to work later and later and it’s hurting me. I wasn’t this bad a few days ago. I’ve been depressed for a long while, but ever since I held this 2 year old as he was having a seizure I just can’t see what’s for tomorrow or the day after. Idk how to explain it. It’s terrible what I’m gonna say. I know I need help but I’m either too retarded or stubborn. When that kid had a seizure, I did what I needed to do to help him, but in all honesty, I didn’t and don’t care. I only did what I did because it’s my job. I didn’t feel bad for him. Realizing that now, it makes me even more depressed and is dragging me down a hole. This time of year is supposed to be amazing, I even have a niece now born 2 months ago.

stoopid2k_idiot,2021-11-24 04:19:55+00:00,Dealing with anxiety/uncertainty arising from problems week after week,"Hi guys, every week it seems life is giving me a bad hand. This week, I was notified that I have been accused of academic dishonesty during one of my exams. I was alleged to have accessed course materials during a closed-book exam, which I did, but not for the intention of cheating. I panicked when I saw my exam in a different format and instinctively opened one of the practice exam papers to check if I had been studying the wrong material. It was dumb, but now I am supposed to meet my Dean's assistant next week. I know the severity of cheating, and I know how difficult it will be to prove that I did not cheat. I am really stressing out over this whole situation because academic dishonesty is a really big thing and I am afraid of being suspended and getting expelled.

What's worse is that I took out a private loan to support my living expenses and housing, and the loan disbursement will not be able to go through unless the matter is resolved as the school currently has a hold on my account. This whole situation has really left me extremely helpless and I am super anxious and worried about what will fold out. I used to live in a different country and city and moved abroad after 2 years of battling mental anxiety and depression to rehabilitate, but it almost seems as if I can't catch a break. Sometimes things get better over here and then something unfortunate, whether it's by luck or by my own actions, just derails my rehabilitation progress. This is the worst week so far, and I feel almost unable to cope with the turmoil in my head. How do you guys deal with all the anxiety and uncertainty? I feel like I need something to pass the week before I actually meet with the Dean's assistant."
rimazd1,2021-11-24 04:17:08+00:00,My heart is so sad it could burst,"Excuse the emo headline but it’s true. I feel such incredible sadness in my heart and there’s no other way to explain it. I used to be such a happy optimistic person and never took anything too seriously and now I just feel beat down by the world. 

I’m so incredibly sad. Everyday stressors, my dead end relationship with a toxic person, my poor financial situation despite having a college degree and working more than full time were all things I could handle but the death of my parent 4 years ago just pushed me over the edge. 

I’ve lost all hope. I no longer see the world the way I used to. I’ve become bitter and mean. 

I used to have such an intense love for music and it went away after he died. I don’t listen or feel the connection like I used to and it makes me sad. Sometimes when I force myself to listen I’ll hear a song that used to make me happy but I just cry instead. Does it ever get better? Will I ever listen the same way again?

How do things ever get better after losing someone to death? There’s no fixing that. It’s forever. 

And I have no one in my life that understand or even cares."

In this moment you are who you choose. What you were in the past is simply a figment of your anxious mind. If you decide right now ""I am better. I am not what I was, I am what I choose to be"" you will be better off.

I hope you all find peace, I truly do. I know how it feels to constantly look over my shoulder hoping no one finds out how alone I am. I know what it feels like to wish I weren't here. But I am here and so are you. Let's enjoy it, or at least genuinely try to."

It hurts feeling you are letting people down let alone yourself even when you have been giving 110% even on the hard days. Now I just want to be happy but all my effort and hope is making me shut down because having a productive day takes all my energy and more. It literally took everything I had to force myself to play a simple video game :( I know its mostly due from me being kinda recent out of a long committed relationship and my bad financial situation which I've never had to experience but most of all is my almost complete isolation from anyone my age... I know I'm Probly not ready to have a romantic relationship now but would like some female friends that are caring and kind easy to talk to.I'm into us sharing things to brighten the mood or if your a smoker we can share who can take a bigger bong rip or something. I'm also a pretty good listener and don't mind hearing your troubles just really trying everything and anything to get back on track I think having a good female homie would make this isolation not so taxing.

txactor13,2021-11-23 08:19:53+00:00,Best friends,"Hey guys, 
I know for the most part , that this group is about venting our frustrations . However, I just wanted to shed a little light on our group.

If you’re ever feeling down and out , reach out to your best friend. It can be the only be you trust the most , so r the one you’ve known the longest. 

Tonight I called up my best  friend to just hang out and we just chilled ,  had a beer or tie and played Pokémon. To me that was the best time ever since it combined childhood with adult hood. 

He knew that I had been struggle by ( he probably didn’t know to the extent that I was) , but we talked it out  and it made me feel a lot better . I want pushing for sympathing or anything . 

However, just to know that he was that and said that he loved me at the end of the night , turned my world around. We’ve always had little be for each other and had each other’s backs for over 20 years , but it struck a real chord tonight .


So I’ll f I were to say anything to anyone in this group , I would say to just hang with your closest friend. ( it can even be a family member ) you never know what they can subconsciously do for you .
I hope and pray everyone has someone in their life like that , cause it can change your entire world .
Much love to everyone and have a good night ."

It has gotten so expensive for me that I can't do it even though my mental health is deteriorating by the day. I feel weird posting this because I've always believed that no one really gave a shit about me at all but if there is anyone who is available to talk through my problems with me I'd pay it weekly.

Roninkin,2021-11-23 00:56:52+00:00,Hey I don’t know if a question fits here but.. Also just talking I suppose.,"Is it normal to think about suicide? Not just like once in a while it’s on my mind almost every day. Especially as of late, I’d assume because of the onset of winter etc. I’ve been kinda overly fixated on it since my depression appeared when I was 13 or 14 (29 at the time of writing.) I assure the reader that I will never do anything, after watching my brother OD and my dad die to covid and the pain it’s caused me and others I could never do that. Plus I know that things will be back to being okay, I just have been very stressed lately. It kind of sucks because I can tell when I am entering a bad period, like my mind won’t want to sleep and I’ll start staying in bed much more so coming up on one.
My grandma, me and my mom were taking care of her as we have off and on for 15 years now and i lost my temper when she..Well she honestly had worse coming acting the way she did. But she tried to physically attack me and then mom, then I broke my foot and she went to the home. Man she hates me and mom now, she was like a second mom that your afraid of lol. I dunno I’m just talking, I’m kinda too scared to talk to my SO or Mom about this stuff. They’ll think it’s their fault when it has nothing to do with them. 
Might sound bleak, but things honestly do get better. 
Anyone struggling too, I hope things get better and I am open to talk."

LordLugus,2021-11-22 19:09:44+00:00,I don't know if this belongs,"I am but a horrid mound of flesh
rumbling its way through this world
unworthy of the pleasures of life 

Too often I find myself more needed than wanted 
Which is fine for me
It grants me purpose if not comfort 

The problem comes when my purpose is served
And I become nothing, unneeded, unwanted 
An after thought 

And so I join this choir
A sea of voices more deserving than my own
All crying out in search of their own peace"

I’m filled with longing and ennui while I imagine those lucky people whose lives unfold like a romantic comedy. Perhaps it’s the current climate or maybe that’s just how you start to feel when you get older— That more doors are closing than are opening.*** 

***I can’t help but feel like maybe I took a wrong turn somewhere or that I am stuck in a kind of purgatory. It all seems so pointless really. Maybe we’re here for a reason? Or maybe we’re just meant to spin around on this decaying rock and order french fries or salads with the dressing on the side until we die.***"
sadpinkgirl,2021-11-22 08:31:32+00:00,venting about my financial situation (also a partial reason of my depression),"I know it’s all my fault that I’m broke before everyone starts being mean towards me for not having a college degree. But I just wanted to vent real quick about my financial situation. I have been working ever since I was 15 years old because I always had to find a way to make money to take care of myself from a very young age (23 now) so I didn’t really have the luxury to be able to go to college right after high school without being homeless and having absolutely no money so after one year of college I decided to drop out because I knew I couldn’t afford it at all. But anyway I’ve been working full time jobs ever since I was 18, worked as a waitress, did Uber, worked at a warehouse, worked for a rental car company, currently work at a grocery store. And honestly I’m tired of constantly working so hard and still being this broke, after my rent and food and phone bill I can’t afford to get a car and tbh after all those bills are paid I only make $300 every two weeks. It just makes me feel so hopeless and I really wish I had the time to just enjoy my day and live a normal life for once.. instead of working 5 days a week from 2:30 to 11pm 5 days straight and never getting to actually enjoy my life. 

I’m tired of it. I want to open up my own business as a nail tech so I can be an independent business owner who sets my own hours but everything cost money and time. Which I don’t have. I’m just hopeless as fuck. Thanks for hearing me out you guys I appreciate it."
canyoulikenaht,2021-11-22 06:49:47+00:00,I’m there for others but no one is there for me.,"I had a friend for years. He was going through a lot and had no one so I befriended him. He would always vent to me about his problems, if he needed me I’d drop anything to go to him and make sure he was okay. He had financial issues and I would pay for his stuff. I didn’t do any of these things hoping he’d pay back nor did I want any favours. We would have so much fun and he would constantly tell me how grateful he was for our friendship. I knew I had my life put and wanted my friend to enjoy the same and he did eventually get better.

Until a few months ago I started going thru hell, it felt like everything about me was crashing down. He was the only person I was the most closest to and the only person I can trust. I called him a while ago to tell him I needed to see him because I was going through alot and I have no one. He said he’ll see me tomorrow around 10. When tomorrow came I received no message or call, I reached out and he told me he can’t come.

I understand that friendships fade, I understand that he doesn’t owe me anything…but deep down I wish I had someone. It also sucks that this happens alot in my past friendships and relationships. I just had to get this off my chest. Aside from not having him there for me, it’s knowing the fact that our friendship is fading that hurts harder."

imminentlimes,2021-11-22 03:05:32+00:00,I don’t know how to explain this feeling.,"Lately I’ve been feeling so alone, even when I’m with people. I feel that way a lot, but lately it’s been worse. 
I’ve been under a lot of stress lately, both mentally and emotionally. 
My mom is very emotionally abusive
My family can be judgmental and unsupportive sometimes 
My dad, who I feel I could only talk to, lives over 4600mi away and I see him less than 3x a year
And I sometimes lack a safe space and emotionally available LDR partner. 
And sometimes, I just want to be shown or feel that I’m loved… not told, shown/felt. Or a priority to someone 

I feel so unworthy sometimes, so alone, like an imposter, and so unimportant

I’ve felt depressed before, but with the more intense overwhelming feeling I’ve been feeling lately from school, responsibilities, and my relationship, this past week has been so hard to get through."
N3tw0rkl1v3,2021-11-22 02:27:47+00:00,wish me luck please,"How I have told you in different posts, my semester is over

 I'm scared but it was my fault
 I'm supposed to evolve not regress
 And at some point I will have to tell my parents
 Tell them their son is stupid
 Q can't study
 Q your hero
 He fell ...
 If I go wrong I will feel very bad because everyone had faith in me
 And the truth is that I have felt very bad
 Try to save
 I don't know if it worked
 If it does not work
 I will never be able to continue my studies
 And I will be punished
 I may never see them again
 I hope I don't cringe
 I thank you anyway for your advice and help that you gave me."

Weary_Return_7166,2021-11-21 20:25:55+00:00,Never alone - always lonely. Venting,"So in all honesty i posted this in one more forum right now. This might Come out wrong but i hope you understand. 
Im not seeking for attention even tho im seeking for attention. I dont want my ""friends"" to ask a thousand questions or to tell me ""its ok, Its all gonna be fine no worries"" ive heard The same words for 12 years give or take. 
But sometimes its just Nice to Maybe wake up to a ""good morning my friend, wish you a good day"" or Maybe ""hey i hope you slept well and that you get a Nice weekend!"" 
Just anything but im basically completely abandoned now and it just feels rough. There is 2 People that tries and they mean The world to me. Basically The core reason to why im still Alive. But im always afraid that i will at some point lose them to since im every day lose more and more of my social skill and getting more anxiety and paranoia. 

Its very Hard to out this is words. But i guess that you folks will understand me better than most People. This is my first text here so please do let me know if i do anything wrongly.
This is The first time that i write anything like this in a public way. 

Im 26 years old speaking, coming up to 27 tomorrow. Ive been heavily depressed since The age of 15ish give or take. Which were close to The time of my first suicide attempt. Obviously it did not go as planned for, details on that i will keep for my self for now. I got what The doctors and specialists call a form of OCD. This makes me continuasly think about suicide even in The most happy Times. I can never really get rid of this. It affects my sleep, my work, my social part incredible much which in its own way have led to countless of problems. Im not good nor am i ""brave"" enough to talk about this verbally/vocaly. I do how ever make a lot of art, both as in drawings and also as in photos. i guess you could call it obscene/morbid type of ""selfies"" to some degree. This is my way of expressing my depression.

Most of my ""friends"" are at some degree aware of my situation, i am not a guy Who really are comfortable of getting ""petted"" by my friends. But yet a single kind Word, or just a check-in text message like ""hey pal, how you doing?"" or ""hope you are having a Nice weekend!"" could ****** make my day sometimes. I was very outgoing before but social anxiety and paranoia kicked in and now im not. It has comed to The level of not being able to work for almost half a year yet so far and most likely as long or more to go. Ive been in and out of psycological hospitals and so on for a while.
After this came out to some People, everything and I mean almost everything just stopped The same minute. No texts, no calls, no invatations nothing. Everything ended.

I do however live with my best friend in a big apartment.
So im never really alone.

But goddamn im lonely."

My brother tortured me, used to beat me, choke me, manipulate me and blackmail me. He still insults me every chance he gets. I still live with them. Growing up i didn’t really go out except for school. 
When went to school i was very jolly, bubbly and extrovert type. I just didn’t want  people to see through me. I was the fun friend. I was the clown. Made everyone laugh. Then went home and cried every single day and night. I feel like an imposter. Like I'm not real. Who even am i?
At the age of 15 i was diagnosed with childhood depression. Now, 19 and have MDD, ADD and anxiety. I suspect i have BPD. 
After my diagnosis i started to open up about my mental health and like everything else in my life to most people it was a joke to them. It hurts so bad. Now i feel stupid. I feel like i should've never uncover my facade."
Area_Standard,2021-11-21 18:08:01+00:00,Do you feel the same?,"I don't know, sometimes I wonder this is all my fault. I love dancing and listening to loud music but when I go to a party I just want to fucking die.
I know how to treat people in a nice way and I always give advice to my friends about relationship, but when it comes to me with someone else I just feel this dreading feeling that keeps me away from trying something new.
I'm disgusted at myself. I don't want to die, but I want you to kill me brutally. I don't want you to touch me, but I want to be forced at. I don't want you to talk or look at me, but I want you to grab me by the neck and punch me in the face forcing me to.
I don't know what I fucking want, I don't know who the fuck I am. It got over the point of ""I want to die"". I feel like the time I'm living with the Depression is slowly but surely driving me insane.
And again, how the fuck can you ask someone to help you fight your own brain? Sometimes I wished someone just used me like a toy anf then killed me, I deserve this."

Wasn’t a full ride but most of it was covered. I’m from a very urban poor area of the country. I’ve come from nothing but abusive and drug ridden house holds. My own mother choose her boyfriend over me and kicked me out. Was homeless for a week until I went to my grandmother for help. 
I’m very grateful for her. I work. I get good grades. If I’m being honest I’m damaged. Seeing my mother get beat everyday having for fight a grown man at 13 always getting beat. Non stop fighting from when I was 6-16 in my own house. My mother is in denial we don’t speak. She won’t help herself. 
I was hooked on hard pill from 13-17 been clean about 2 years now. I was actually. I relapsed last week. I’ve been depressed for years. If I’m being honest only reason I haven’t kill myself was my girlfriend she helped. Knew all my problems. Together 3 years it was hard with her easy. She always helped. 
Than she cheated. Mother caught me preparing to hang myself that day. Was hospitalized for a couple days until they let me go. That was last month. I’ve genuinely been cutting myself so fucking much it’s disgusting. I feel I’m to grown for this but I’ve felt lost for so long. The only thing keeping me sane left. 
I haven’t thrown out our things there just in my room. She already has a new man. Well guess he was there the whole time. I’m just losing hope. I just cut myself before typing this I still have the alcohol bandage on my arm trying to stop the bleeding. I’m trying because I’m not stupid but I’m losing this battle. Haven’t eaten in 2 days. Longest was 9. If anyone actually read this. Thank you. Just venting never even posted on this app before. Hope I did it right."

Halloyumii,2021-11-20 21:03:20+00:00,"I’ve dealt with suicidal ideation for over 12 years, but it isn’t just depression.","I’ve wanted to die for years now, but I haven’t brought myself to do it yet. Seeing others succeed always makes me think “I’m just as capable to create happiness in my life as everyone else” so I never gone all the way (only partial attempts). Constantly failing, loneliness, and general unfairness of life has been a constant theme in my life no matter how hard I push to change things. Even when people say “You can do anything” a lot of things aren’t in my control, and staying mindful doesn’t always help. Most of the time it spirals me deeper into depression.

I can’t find the joy in simply existing most days when you only two choices are to be isolated, or to be around people who have no concept of what I’m going through. 
(I also have lived in areas where it’s hard to make friends because I can’t afford to live anywhere else) and I have no family or community.

I read about a term today that’s called “Shit life syndrome”. It’s where people’s lives are wrought with things like family breakdown, poverty, lack of opportunities, or lack of opportunity to turn around situations in their lives (sometimes for systemic or medical reasons), isolation, lack of agency etc… 

I feel like this ABSOLUTELY describes my situation. It isn’t just general depression or chemical imbalance. It’s being dealt a hand in life that’s SHIT.

I’m sick of feeling like being on earth is a punishment. I’m sick of being told I can manifest when I’ve tried and failed for years. I’m sick of seeing the universe respond differently to me than to everyone around me. 
I don’t want to live, and a pill isn’t gonna fix a handful of unfortunate circumstances. 

Life isn’t the same for everyone and the only people who say it is are the people who got lucky enough."

SpaceEngineersRocks,2021-11-20 20:39:08+00:00,M16 Am I depressed or just stupid?,"Very often I just get the feeling of ""not wanting"" and then I start to think about stuff. 

Like that I will never find someone to spend the rest of my life with, that all I have done in my life has no actual meaning, that most people that I think are my friends hurt me repeatedly and that I am probably going to loose everyone I love soon because of them rejecting me because of my personality and behaivour. I feel like everyone and every goal I have been chasing is getting further and further away. I rarely end things that I start and end up hating myself (I should be doing homework right now).

Those thought trains usually end in me killing my self, but like I am 100% sure thath I don't actually think that way. I think that maybe I want to be depressed so that I get attention? If what I am describing really is depression I just want to start doing something against it now and not when it is too late."

AVCthrown,2021-11-20 18:46:40+00:00,I don't think I'm turning 20 next year,"To the people who know me,



As I'm writing this, I've already been to support group sessions and am scheduling an appointment with a counselor. Hopefully things go well and this letter stays unsent. I'm writing this in case anything bad happens. I'll leave this account as the only one on my phone when I can't take it anymore.



I don't know when heaven or hell will come calling, or if I end up deciding to put myself there. So I guess this would be the last you hear from me if ever.




Things are hard and I have not felt well, not for the last year and a half. I've been cooped up, tired and hopeless. This is what the world is like now. It's so empty and devoid of anything really. It's just day after day of feeling like this. There was a point in time where I had a lot of hope that things could get better. I look outside and see everything though, still locked down and far from normal. I know you're probably tired of hearing those words so I'm sorry. I know things won't get any better for a long time, and I don't expect them to. Netflix is cool and there's a ton of stuff I haven't watched yet, but that only goes so far. I miss the energy, the way rooms light up when people are there. I'm an introvert and I don't talk to them, but the feeling's nice. I miss waiting for snacks before a movie. I miss the walk to school, taking in the life of the city not knowing what came next. Apparently what came next was this: me reaching new lows.




Is it really selfish if I don't want to be in this situation anymore? 



I've heard all of the usual power of positivity quotes. ""It gets better"", ""this will pass"", ""you're still so young"", and all that life affirming stuff. At some point, they lose their power and become simple words. I know you find them hard to believe too. I feel like a sack of meat and everything is meaningless. People tell me everything's gonna be better next year or the year after that. I don't feel like waiting that long.



I'm sure you know what it's like to live life on a screen. I go to school on a tablet and it's just so inhuman. My professors barely give a shit the way they so generously dole out deadlines like candy. I bet half of them don't even know I'm in their class. People don't seem real anymore. Heck, the world outside my house may as well be a fantasy. I realized that there was no point to any of this. 



To tell you the truth, I don't really see why I should feel this strongly. I have a home, food and water. I saved up enough money to buy clothes and stuff. I'm not starving or ill. I don't suffer the same way so many people do. I shouldn't have anything to complain about. Really, I should be grateful, and I am. I was put into a good home with good people, and for 19 years it's helped me. But things are different now, I don't know why exactly.




I've always mourned for the life I could've had. Maybe I would've learned how to talk to people. Maybe I would have gone on adventures. Pet some wolves maybe? I don't know, it all sounds so stupid now.


You wanna know what hurts? I think there's another universe where things turned out better. I was actually feeling well before the last one and a half years. The sun shone much brighter then. What I would give just to have my life like that again. But then again, my bitching about could haves and should haves won't make anything happen. What's done is done.



This is the life I was given. This is what I deserve. This is all I'll ever be. I'm fine with that. I wasn't meant to be anyone great. I was never that guy who could hold a conversation or build a relationship. I'm not the kind of guy that people are drawn to. I was never meant for the life I dreamed up in my head.  This is the life I was granted.


So you know what, life? You win. I'm defeated



I have a feeling that I'm not going to last to my 20th birthday. It's alright, it wouldn't have been anything special anyway. My going away won't be any kind of great tragedy. I'm sure some people will care, but I also know that everything else will keep moving along fine. My few friends will have other friends and my family will have other family. You guys will be fine. That's just the way it's always been. I don't see a future anymore, not a good one at least. Let me rest. 


Go ahead, make jokes about how I died a virgin, about how I make immature jokes and how I'm weirdly quiet. Call me stupid, ugly, and whatever else you want. I won't be here for it anyway.




Lastly, this is gonna sound weird, but I want to apologize to a (possible) future.


To the girl I might have had my first kiss with, to anyone I might have had a relationship with, to the children I might've had, to the friends I may have made, and to anyone else whose life I might've played a part in, I am sorry. Please try to understand. This wasn't meant to hurt you. It was supposed to make the pain stop.


 
Everyone says there's a light at the end of the tunnel. I just wanted to get there faster."
Professional_Cup6286,2021-11-20 17:22:00+00:00,I often think about running away,"I often think about running away or getting hospitalized just for having space from everybody and everything. lately my condition is getting lower where to the point I feel so lost, I don't know who I am anymore and I only know myself when I'm at home.

I have an apartment far away (2+ hours from home) and I'm working at the area. I don't get much money and I barely have any. but I feel so stressed I can't bare the thought of keeping on living this way, so lost in my place.

I want to have the life I always wished for, but I'm afraid if I leave I may ruin good things.

I've been talking with my therapist about my current situation but I haven't touched deep in this subject (cause I believed there was nothing to do) and I'm feeling like I'm fantasizing about running away but reality just smashing me in the face telling me I can't. (because of money mostly, and good things that are coming soon, don't want to lose them)

I just needed to get it off my heart cause man I feel like I'm drowning in all this stress"

I go to gatherings and parties but I feel nothing from the people I’m around. I want a genuine connection with someone, whether it be a girlfriend or a friend, and I hate being alone, but when I’m out with certain people they just don’t do it for me and I’m left feeling empty, depressed and just full of despair. Like there is just no way to win for me. When I’m alone I want to be around others, but when I’m around others I don’t get what I need, and it just feels so pointless. It may seem like all I need to do is find new friends, but it seems so hard. I just feel as if I don’t relate to anyone or I am judged for being different (how I act, speak, etc.), I’m just so different to the culture in my country/city and I am yet to find anyone who is the same. And it just leads me to question who I am because I can’t seem to find anyone who fits with me. I just regret so much of my past it eating me alive, and I don’t know where to go or what to do. I don’t even know who I really am because I just don’t know where I belong."

He's 22, muscular, good looking, clean, never done drugs or alcohol, a virgin waiting for his soulmate, served a mission, has close friends, lives an adventure. He's so wonderful. He has a satisfying fulfilling life. Why can't I be like him? Why can't I be perfect? It just sucks. I hate that I'm so weak and weird and wrong. I hate being ugly inside and out. Always being alone. How do people do it I don't get it. There's this other guy who grew up skinny and unattractive but worked out a bunch and now he's shredded and handsome. I try and work out but I know I'll never be anything like him. Lately I haven't cared enough to stop sleeping in or brush my teeth. It sucks to suck I guess."

I wouldn't care but I trained most of them and they just kind of talk about my personal life far more than I would like. They don't know much about my personal life actually and I will not hangout with them because we share no common interests whatsoever 


Even though I'm not looking to make friends at work it does kind of suck knowing that everyone talks about me constantly and doesn't care about my feelings at all. Even my ""enemies"" I don't want to have hurt feelings and I never have understood why people think it's okay to make another person feel bad. 

When you call them out on this they resort to name calling you more, claiming u are a crybaby or something and so it leaves you feeling alone and like a complete loser."
BossLady311,2021-11-20 01:05:34+00:00,I went to the ER today to get help.,This is not to discourage anyone from not seeking help. I went there early this morning because I just could not face another day at work of hiding my depression and crying in my office and faking smiling with coworkers. I barely got dressed and got my daughter to school. I felt like a zombie. I had scary suicidal thoughts yesterday and I wanted help. My experience was degrading and embarrassing. People were coming in talking to the sitter they assigned to me about me like I wasn’t just 2 feet away from them. Even my nurse talked to her about my next steps to move upstairs but didn’t explain it to me. I had another sitter upstairs who sat on the phone for about 45 mins planning a vacation. While I’m crying in a hospital bed about all my financial problems and stress and grief. I had heard about the paper scrubs but didn’t realize how embarrassing it is to wear them and have to walk past other people’s rooms in them. It was terrible. The “liaison” that everyone kept telling me was going to talk to me never came to talk to me once. He was at the desk on his phone the whole time. Luckily I did see a doc via telepsych who was very nice and understanding. They encourage people to go seek help and then you get treated like crap when you find the courage to go.

I think I just simply never thought I would have been alive that long. Now I’m in my twenties and I feel like I outlived my life expectancy and not in a good way. I should also add that I have loved ones and am supported and go to therapy and take meds. There isn’t some specific reason that would make me hate being alive as much as I do and that makes me feel even more like I don’t deserve to be alive and I wish I wasn’t.

I kinda feel sad most of the time, but sometimes I just feel really, really bad, hopeless and lonely. Also, probably scared. 
It’s like a wave of anxiety hitting me.

I already see a therapist once a week, work really hard on myself, idk what more I can do.

Being a failure in my eyes has been eating me alive and it’s all I can think about 24/7 sending me into a spiraling depression I can’t seem to get out of, it even gets as bad sometimes as thoughts of suicide creeps into my mind in my worst moments. I’m honestly just unsure how to get out of this rut and wish I just had some sort of plan or stability so I can stop feeling like there’s no hope for me and I’m doomed to be a failure and embarrassed next to my peers and successful family members."

I have no motivation to do anything about it, I take psychedelics because to be honest they make me feel very happy and let me have a peaceful headspace. 
I’m so tired of doing this shit. 
I’ve been wanting to die for so long but it’s so impossible in the position I’m in. 
It’s like when people are around me I’m just invisible, so why the fuck would it matter if I was to finally end this. 
The feeling I get from thinking of dying is the best release possible. It makes me feel like I’m home. 
Like I’m not meant to make it to 20. 
After all the efforts of me trying to get better and living a normal happy life, shit just doesn’t go the way you always wanted, I had a masterplan for my way out but it’s impossible to get nitrogen tanks around me. Ssri and molly goes beautifully"

howhighistheskyy,2021-11-18 12:33:54+00:00,How do I stop outside influences affecting me so much?,"I have been seeing doctors &amp; therapists. Unfortunately I haven’t found a therapist who has been able to understand or identify cycles. I am on meds. That side of things is not the issue. 

I never used to set boundaries, I do now, I think because of my mental health issues I’ve lost a lot of my friends, I hardly hear from my sibling anymore, they moved away and we used to be close but they don’t make any effort to contact me unless they need something. 

I find it so hard to find decent friends in my life (what I mean by decent is, mutual respect and back and forth relationships, I’ve told people I used to be friends with about my mental health, I make effort not to talk about it too much as I get that can wear people down, I feel like I don’t have any friends that care about me, and they’re all about their issues) and I don’t really have anyone there for me. I would not say I feel lonely but more rejected in that no one seems to care, especially when I’ve been there for other people/friends. 

How can I find peace in myself for not having any friends and how can I prevent peoples lack of care, or rude attitude towards me affecting how I feel? It’s a tiering cycle which I don’t want to be in anymore."
LumiGloomy,2021-11-18 09:21:03+00:00,I’m feeling like a horrible person,"I pushed my 2 only friends away last month. And I finally told them what had happened but it’s basically I’ve let so much fear and anxiety and hatred for myself build up that I stopped believing anything they told me and always felt so disconnected and and overwhelmed that it lead to me becoming silent and disappearing every once in a while. 

And that I don’t feel anything towards them anymore. Whenever I try to figure out what I’m feeling it’s too painful so I stop. So I only feel sadness thinking of them. And when I returned to them it was because I was afraid. If I push away too much I’ll lose the only friends I have so that in mind and not being able to face my thoughts towards them yet I don’t know if I’m friends with them because I want to be friends with them or if I’m just scared of letting go and being alone again. 

It was hard to accept that I needed help, it’s harder to accept the actions I did that hurt others because I didn’t try to get help sooner."

vectoricky,2021-11-18 02:52:12+00:00,Am I ready to leave?,"The question I kept asking to myself every time I'm attempting to grab a knife at the kitchen and ready to slash off my throat. But after a few minutes, I randomly stops and just cry a lot ending up on a sleep. Wake up, still depressed and the cycle repeats. Existential crisis hits different. Seriously, I don't want to die like this but it's the only way I can think of. 

I had an insomia for 6 years or maybe more, lost track of it. Sleep is the one I'm lacking rn so I wish I could just die on my sleep peacefully so it'll not traumatize my family seeing me lying in the bed full of blood.  

This 28th of Nov. is my birthday, I'm turning 23 and still has no regular job, a freelance digital artist for 4 years and earns a little to none. No one buys my art, no one wants to have a commission with me. My parents are pissed off and kept pushing me to get a job but honestly I tried but failed. I can't tell them that I'm an introvert and have a social anxiety. So I guess this is it. End of the line. Just a few days away.

I hope I can have the courage this upcoming birthday but honestly, how to die in sleep? Any suggestions on how to do it? I just wanna get over this."

I have had 4 attempts and have confronted him in therapy. I apologized for my action (that I literally cannot remember) and all he says is yeah I said that I was angry. No apology no you matter. I know I am supposed to be the bigger person but how can I look at my brother and not feel rage. How had you look your little sister and say that? Why is everyone in my family not as disgusted as I am? In my head before attempts I make a pro and con list. The first pro is that I will not ruin my family, they don’t need me. No amount of I love yous can change that. How do I accept this? How do I move on when I am forced to see him?

asim0092,2021-11-17 22:50:22+00:00,The dynamic between mother and father in relation to the offspring (and how this is seen in this sub),"It seems to me that many people on this sub and when dealing with individuals who have problems believe that compassion is the ultimate means of helping them. Compassion alone, however, in my estimation, is not enough. Take this common example:

A child does something wrong or fails to do something right: the mother comes along and affectionately holds him, tells him he is okay, and offers all the empathy she has. The father does this to a degree, but attempts to tell the child what he did wrong or how he could do things better. The mother gets angry at the husband, telling him he is not being compassionate and to leave the child alone.

Again, whenever the child is in distress or hurt, the father knows that if he attempts to help the child in a way that is more than just mere empathy, his wife will berate him and accuse him of being too harsh. Instead of picking the child up, telling him ""hey you're okay kid"" when he slips and scraps his knee, the mother every time coddles him, ""my pooooor baby"" and does not allow the father to step in. Eventually, the father gives up attempting to parent ""his own"" way due to knowing the mother will give him crap for it.

This is actually quite a common dynamic in relationships where the wife has an ""alpha"" personality if you will, or is wearing the pants so to speak, and has a very high nurturing trait. Some of you might leap to the far end of the spectrum and think ""oh well the father should be more sympathetic instead of trying to fix the kid"" and to those of you you're not getting what it means to help beyond offering compassion.

Compassion is not enough, and EXCESS compassion is detrimental. People don't need an excess in compassion, as an excess is not derived from the heart but ego. In addition to compassion (motherly love) a child (and all humans) need an ideal to strive toward, a greater goal, an expectation set by either them or someone else... a (father) figure. Don't get too hung up on the mother/father play, this can easily be reversed but for the sake of this example I'm attributing compassion to the archetypal mother and expectation to the father.

How this relates to this sub I've noticed is that everyone has all but thrown this fatherly love out the window in favor for the motherly love. Phrases like ""you are valid"" and ""it's not your fault"" are prime examples of that potentially overbearing mother. I say potentially, as those phrases are not wrong in any way, however they are incomplete without the other half of the coin: the father. Again, it doesn't have to be two people, a mother and father, these are just the dual types of energy, of love, given and can be done by a single person.

Again, compassion alone is not enough. The second half has to be apart of the equation if you guys truly want to help others or yourselves. ""You are valid, but what can you do to grow?"" That is a complete dynamic of the two energies. ""It's not your fault, but suck it up kiddo it's what you got"".

People who think ""you're just being an asshole, you lack sympathy, stop trolling"" are the kinds of people who's fathers likely gave up on giving them a goal to strive for as children. They were told ""you are enough"" by overbearing mothers. Yes AND no. ""You are enough but you can be so much more.""

I totally understand why ""tough love"" has become frowned down upon when it comes to depression, but when paired with ""soft love"" the two can do so much more for a person than those two alone. The thing about a community is that now we are all technically in the role of the parent and child. So when one person offers ""soft love"" advice and another offers ""tough love"" advice, that is complete. So to tell the person offering ""tough love"" advice that they are being an asshole is to be that mother who does not allow her husband to parent because she doesn't like it. Don't be that person."

seeyou2nite,2021-11-17 16:18:38+00:00,drugs are wonderfully terrible,"when my ex left me i was in a dark dark place. i felt utterly alone (i still do - i cope) and needed to escape reality. so what does one with money and time do? buy drugs of course! i live where you can get weed quicker than a pizza so I've been set up here lol. it soon escalated to mdma. then it was acid, coke, ket, dmt and anything i could get my stupid mittens on.

one particular trip changed everything. i was 3 tabs deep and i had my ketamine laid out so i could khole at my peak. i was sniffing my last line when i felt drip back. usually i would just wipe it with my finger and rub my gums. except this wasn't drip back but blood. my nose fucking exploded and although I've got a fat snozz, it has never bleed before.

so naturally i thought i was dying and broke out my khole to get tissue. it stopped after 5 mins and i think i just got a cut in my nose from poorly crushed ket. ah but the damage has been done, mentally.

the walls of my palace fell down, the fantasy was drained and i was left peaking on acid and ket. i was about to call an ambulance (shit gets like that) when i spotted my exes messages. man. just reading 'i love you, be safe my love' when at that point she'd been seeing someone else. it broke me. it really did. i was crying for around 3 hours. it was such a juxtaposition of emotions: few minutes prior i was in la la land now im in the earths core digging through the dirt. when i think about it i still want to cry. i miss you r.c so much - i hope you're happier without me.

i just want to tell you guys do NOT substitute drugs for how you feel. a little spliff or a drink is fine, but not like i was. i swear down i had enough drugs to kill the street in my bag and i was intent on doing it all. please. you're prolonging your misery, face it head on and stay sober. you're not built different,  you're going to fall apart like me. im doing better now but that level of going insane is always there. im only a phone call away from getting back to it. but i wont. i want a wife and children one day and nobody will love me when im in that place. feel free to talk to me, anybody that is. i want to help people even if its just talking to you lovely souls. love you all, peace ✌"

Sometimes I sit and wonder,
Why life keeps pulling you under.
It's not healthy to hold a grudge, 
It slows the mind like it's full of sludge.
The world goes on even of somethings wrong,
So cut the one out who don't sing the same song.
Don't get me wrong I'm not much at first sight, 
But I'm experienced and coherent in the thoughts that I write.
Lower and lower in this pit of dispare, 
I reach for the top while I'm gasping for air
I fight with my demons day and night,
Giving up is not an option in sight.
I'm not done with this world and it's not done with me
So again and again I'll fight till I'm free
So behind closed doors or in front of the masses
I'll keep on fighting till the depression passes
The life you have is precious so don't squander it for a minute
Let the darkness lift you in your mind and your spirit."

All it gave me was slightly better mood but that's it, I thought it began when my mom died 3 years ago but I realized I was feeling that way for a long time before jt. It's been hitting me more now because this summer was different. When the school year ended life was going too smoothly. I got a good paying job which meant I could go have fun, we began building a shed with my dad which surprisingly was a lot of fun and it could become my hobby and the best thing that happened that summer is that I met a girl which i madly fell in love with and at that time she seemed to fall for me as well I thought i was dreamin it was like a fairytale, I had everything no thing to be worried about. I felt like life got a new shine. This void feeling was still there but it was weaker. Fast forward to September, I had this terrible feeling everything's is going to ruin, like I'd wake up and cry without a reason, i couldn't eat, sleep, you name it. And well it happened i got kicked out of the job, the love of my life left me without properly communicating, we talked for a while I told her everything, she just said she's sorry and poof bam gone. But that's not the end of it. Mid September my dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and he's been getting worse since, my friend group is slowly crumbling. But the thing hittin me the most here is my dad, he's the only real family I have left and if the worst happens I don't know what I'll do. I am not ready to be completely alone in this world especially when the voices in my mind been telling me shit I don't want to hear. I know everything here is probably not my fault but I feel like it could went better if I was better. I really want to get up and just somehow fight trough it I even found a new job which somehow give me a little hope. But all of this is eating me from the inside, every second of the day I am on a verge of breaking down. I know those problems might be trivial for someone but I just don't see my life getting better soon, I am not the one to give up but I am just tired I want to have one day of this year's summer back when I was at peace and first time in my life I could say i was truly happy.

Sorry for something like this, i just had to let it out somewhere well because I don't really have anyone to talk to except my one friend but I don't want to bother him anymore with my shit cuz i say the same thing everytime."

0LonesomeWanderer0,2021-11-17 03:00:10+00:00,Potential TW ahead,"So I feel like I'm being selfish in a way because the last year and a half I've had suicidal thoughts. I do my best every day and I treat everyone with love and respect. I've gone years with loving myself and everything there is, but recently I'm tired of giving love but not reviving it. I don't know what I want but I wanna feel someone else's compassion and love but it's never here. 

I said selfish because my family just lost our father and my mother lost her husband. I don't wanna give them more pain, but I can't help to think it'll be easier when I don't have to feel this anymore. I don't know how to love myself anymore because I've been doing that for so long it doesn't work anymore. 

I'm going crazy because I'm in a silver lining of helping people around me and trying to help myself. I'm afraid if I avoid the problems my family is feeling they'll see how I feel. I don't want them to because I know how much it hurts, and the last thing I want is them to hurt more. 

I have zero close friends they're all out taking care of their life, I'm relatively all alone because my family can't help me. I've tried asking for help but I get no answers or solutions because they're hurt over their mourning.

Relationships, friendships, career, creating my own family, none of it ever made me feel like ""ah, it's good to be alive."" The ONLY thing that ever keeps me going is my family, which is a v small circle of 3 people, not including my mom who already passed. Since I was small I always remember feeling like I didnt want to be here or that nothing matters. 

I've been to counseling throughout my childhood, high school, and college. As an adult, I havent seen someone in more than a year and it's really taking a toll on me to the point where I think I'd like to take medication for it (which I was extremely opposed to). Personally, I'd like to delve deeper into my religion but I can never find the will to, which makes me feel worse. 

Has anyone else felt like this since they were a child? If so, how are u doing now? Cause I'm not doing too hot rn."

Looking back it’s easy, but if you have never talked about it this concept is so daunting.

This is what this reddit is for, this allows them to start gaining confidence in what has happened, to start talking to people. And it works because it’s anonymous.

There’s no harm in initially hiding or making accuses, but do try work on opening up. And I tjink this is what this reddit should be for.

This is the first sign of admitting a problem and getting help. This is a big step!

I just find it annoying how some people are like tell everyone the truth as hiding it provokes more self harm.

Its A LOt harder than it sounds"

Pitiful-Nature5576,2021-11-16 21:42:44+00:00,Why isn’t depression given the same treatment as a physical injury?,"No one blames you if you break a bone or sprain a wrist but when it comes to depression there seems to be blame on the victim.

I think a lot of the struggle sometimes is about not being given the time and resources to heal like you are given when let’s say you break a bone. 

Teachers will be empathetic and work to adjust around you physical injury but nope not when it comes to depression… you are just expected to keep going. Can’t get out of bed? Why the fuck not? Essay do tomorrow and you can’t focus cause ur sad? That’s sucks but hey that’s life and everyone is sad.

I have had sort of a relapse in depression. I was doing much better but I’m going down a rabbit hole. It surprised me how I’m disappointed in myself and how disappointed my family is with me too. Like if it was a broken bone there would be no blame placed upon me but for some reason their is this notion that I got myself to this point willingly or consciously."

We both had bad families and I always liked to hangout with him because we both were depressed and didn't have good lives. He didn't have many friends and everyone wanted to talk to me for some reason but ptsd kept me quiet and anxious. Because I seemed so popular he always thought I was so cool. One day he came in and he was happy to see me but after a couple seconds he asked me how to commit suicide. I was young so I didn't know what to say. All I remember was that I didn't give good advice. The next day he came into school he showed me surprisingly big cut he made with a pencil sharpener blade It was the only blade he could find. He looked at me kind of disappointed and said ""The blade wasn't sharp enough"" After that I took the tiny blade I wasn't suicidal at the time and didn't know what else to do. He chased me for it and I told him He's too young. It reminds me of what my friend told me this year he made me promise not to die until I'm 26. I knew we were both tremendously depressed but I was too young to end my life and so was he so I spent the day with him and walked him home and tried to make him feel better. Now I can't stop thinking about him and feeling really sad. I hope he's still alive."

I don’t care I my mom my sisters or my dad just drops dead I just want to be left alone. My grandpa died recently we were really close and I didn’t feel anything I was able to watch Netflix and  laugh at the jokes on the show I watched like we just didn’t got to his funeral. I think I’m becoming a psychopath or something I think my sister thinks so too. I swap from feeling nothing and then pure anger all the time when I’m not apathetic I’m just mad and crying while mad so maybe I’m not a total apathetic  psycho but still. I feel like a spoiled brat that’s been given everything but still fucks everything up. I go to a private school and with all the money my parents spend I’m dumb no matter how much I try to study, I tried sports and was good for a while but I guess I’m fat and unfit now so I’m on the B team I tried getting back on the A team but I sucked I was on the A team for 7 years so it really hurt.my grades dropped even lower this year and it’s almost 9th grade where grades start to count so my mom hit me a lot with my hokey stick and I’m just don’t want to live anymore I don’t know why the breaking point for me was losing my AirPods at school. Maybe because they’re the only things that help me calm down but I just don’t want to be alive anymore unlike my last one this isn’t confused emotions that Reddit didn’t even like so they deleted it I have planned to kill my I’m a minor so I don’t have the money to but the stuff to do it so I planned to do it after Christmas so I could get Christmas money and so I don’t ruin their time if I don’t change my mind I’ll probably delete my accounts before I do it. They don’t deserve to know why I did it 

Please don’t send messages trying to convince me not to I’m switching off my notifications so it won’t matter I just wanted to have at least one place that my care if I die though it might be a little selfish and narcissistic of me to do that and I guess bye for the last time to anyone who cares"

theLazyDonut33,2021-11-16 10:45:40+00:00,I Didn’t Have a Happy Childhood,"I was a happy kid, that’s according to my mom. When I was around the age of four/five, I witnessed my mom get physically beaten by my father that had never lived with us. It was late I remember, my younger sister was there, but she wasn’t there to witness it like I was. My mom told me not to answer the phone that night when my dad called, but I did anyways. I hate myself so much for it. Because after that he came to our home and started a huge argument with my mom in the living room. I was there watching the whole thing, not fully understanding why. But I was playing with a toy and I distracted my mom from the argument to show her my toy and when she turned her head, my father took the opportunity to attack her, breaking her nose, her jaw, knocked out teeth. 

I don’t really remember my reaction but I remember my mom yelling for me to call the police and I didn’t know what to do. It hurts to remember me going into the bathroom and climbing onto the sink and reaching into a medicine cabinet for a bandaid. It hurts because I was just a kid. I remember trying to put a bandaid on my mother’s face, I remember the amount of blood, I remember trying to help her stop the bleeding. While my dad took the opportunity to run out the house. 

I hate myself so much for that night. I hate myself for answering the my father’s phone call. I hate the fact that I couldn’t call the police, but luckily the neighbors next door was able to. But I hate myself so much. I hate that when the cops came and took my mother away on a stretcher, that I couldn’t find that one photo I had of my dad, so he could pay for what he did. 

I hate that when I had to go to preschool the next following days, that when my teacher’s asked why I had been absent, I had to tell them, “My daddy put my mommy in the hospital.”

My mom told me that after that night, she lost her little girl. That I lost that happiness I once had. And I had to grow up, living in fear of what happened to my mother, about how it could happen again because my mother wasn’t financially stable and had to rely on my dad to help her make ends meet. 

I don’t know why I felt the need to share this, but recently, my mind began to replay back that night. I’m starting to think I have some sort of PTSD or something because now I can’t stop thinking about it. I have so much self-hatred from this, I wished that my mom had never even met my dad and I wish that I was never born. 

I wish that I was never born and I hate myself so much. I always do things to fuck shit up."

RyMac1994,2021-11-16 06:58:40+00:00,Kinda Stuck Unsure How To Get Myself To Stop,"So, I posted on here before and it seemed to help me get out of how bad I was before, so hopefully this helps again.

I can’t seem to stop myself from doing absolutely off the wall changes to myself to try and give me some kind of feeling. Dying my hair, constantly rearranging my room, trying a new “diet” every few weeks. If the same for too long, I start to get down on myself again and get the urge to do anything to avoid it. 

The other issue is that, after my 7 year relationship ended recently, I cannot for the life of me say no to people. Makes sense I just want to be around people and not make them upset with me. The issue comes in where I have a person who is taking advantage of that and, to make a long story short, continuously makes plans with me and cancels them and constantly keeps me around as “a back-up plan”. Now, I have heard from so many people just stop making plans with her, but I can’t shake the feeling it would make her upset and the last thing I want is to put someone in the headspace I’m in. 

So my question is two fold. First part, how do I sort of just become content with who I am and second, how do I stop being so concerned about someone else’s mental health at the cost of my own?"

 Because of my mental health, I just couldn't open my emails.

I just wanted to make my parents and graduation proud and now I'm even more of a fucking disappointment. 

This was supposed to be one of the best days of my life. A day I actually was looking forward to since I was a child and now I can't fucking go. It takes place in less than 2 weeks. 

How can I face them. I'm such a disappointment and failure of a daughter to them. I just wanted to make them proud. I always upset them."
incoralium,2021-11-15 14:31:42+00:00,"Help, I need a way, any of them.","Last year I was the most happy of men 

Just graduated as engineer (Industrial IT/software) at the age of 21 (usually its 24 but I'm gifted brain ), a girlfriend I loved (17y).

Since then, I sank into a colorless routine. 

I had to break with my GF. Despite being close in age, she had a regular scolarity, so she just went for her own studies.

I had to move too because I applied to my 1st job. I started on january. My job was supervising and selling a software for Hospitals accross all europe. It was  interesting, I traveled across my state ( border were closed) and got friend with my coworkers. Also, I was living in a shared house ( I rent a room. Kitchen, bathrooms and laundry are shared ) with people turnover (many where from RBnB ). It was a good situation, I befriended my housemates too.
It was still a mid term situation as I'd need to find a somewhere to settle (own apartment ).

That's where it falls appart.

All suddenly became really delusional after my government forbide any visits to hospital (even as professional) and clinic for non vaccinated people, back in last Jully. 

My company find me ""an other suitable post"" of answering phone all day for support. It's trashy, stressful and mentally uninteresting day to day job. Yet, as they ""offered"" me this, I can't ask for a paid departure (compensation).
So, before I hang myself, I just resigned from the job (with 1 month of delay) and I'm now unemployed, without any income.

September, I go live to my parents house as I have nowhere else to go. As my car is parked in the street, someone crashed into it and left without any hints. It took 2 months to make it drive again. 

I don't see anyone but my little brother (13) and my parents who keeps calling me ""a failure"" even in front of my bro. Basically, I've left my direct family when I was 15 to go for studies living with my grandfather (who died in last april of degenerative disease).

But I now have ""everything"" in my hands, yet I simply can't do shit.  

First, I don't know if my fields interest me anymore. I want something dynamic, I want diversity.  
Second, I want to leave, run from this trash country. I consider swiss as my privileged destination. Here, Everything is collapsing and we face a terrible politic crisis but I won't be able to stay by myself anywhere else without having a wage to support my move.  
Third, I don't know anyone. I don't know anyone to ask for help.

Also as winter comes, I just can't even plan to sleep in my car.

I can apply to anything, yet I don't know what's my life will be. I feel like trapped. And anything I do can ends from a single retarded decision of this corrupted government. And in the other hand, many companies are shut or facing trouble because of lack of components from China. Especially car industry who carry our economy.

What should I do, where can I go ? 

pls help me. I don't know what to do."

I am currently in a program that allows me to basically be in college even though I'm still a highschool student, its just through a community college right next to our highschool. Sure, its a cool thing to brag about and I was planning on getting my associates degree by the time I graduated highschool. And I don't know if its because of the seasons changing and just naturally getting like 20x more depressed. This year has been the hardest for me, from being infatuated over a guy who treated me awfully, loosing all my friends, being stuck in a toxic household, and to being completely hopeless with everything and everyone around me. I am currently failing all of my classes. I don't know how to ask for help. I am not diagnosed with anything as I am fearful of how my mother would react if I were to try and get help. Which leads me to what I came to write about. I am in college 'help' programs that help with scholarships and everything you could need to be ready for college. And I don't know why anymore. I feel like I can't even do one more year of highschool, how am I supposed to go for any longer? Not only that but I simple can not see myself doing anything in the future, can't see myself going to school, can't see myself with anyone, can't see myself alive. I feel like I have no meaning in life. and im just watching myself prove it true and rotting away. i dont know how to tell anyone this without getting 'in trouble' or them calling my mother. but at the same time i want them to. i want someone to see that i need help without them being mad or upset. im so tired."

Also , moles over my face and body makes me look even worse. I got the worst pair genetics. Its just something i cant change. People used to mock me a lot because of the way i look , especially in school. It feels like no one is gonna like me.

Im not good at other things either. I suck at studying , scored so low in my exams. I have no talent. My parents hates me and they even said that im worthless.... :(

I dont have friends or people to talk to and share my feelings with. Im socially awkward as well , and i fucking hate it. I cant even talk with people properly...💀

A_scar_means_I_live,2021-11-15 07:34:03+00:00,Really hating the world lately,"I’m really hard on myself, and its similarly difficult for me to admit that. I was fortunate enough to be born to Canadian parents in 1997. I was born with TGR(Transposition of the great arteries is a serious but rare heart defect present at birth, in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed). 

At 15 I caught a virus, had a cardiac arrest inside of a walmart, and the medical team that revived me also hit a nerve while inserting a needle into my leg, giving me drop-foot (I can walk normally using an orthotic).

While in hospital my vocal chords were paralyzed for being intubated. I got surgery to fix that after a month or so.

Two years after my heart transplant I developed an autoimmune disease called behcets disease. Its really shitty, look it up.

I also have adhd and can’t be put on medication due to my other conditions.

Looking back, maybe I am an idiot, at 21 I decided to become a practical nurse (2 year program). 

Now I’m burnt out, depressed, I inconsistently go to work, I’m anemic and my spleen is enlarged. But people don’t see this, they just see another ‘healthy’ person. My own father gets upset when I try and express my feelings."

Anyway I lived in New Jersey most of my life and mostly, was a pretty positive one. I’m a huge hockey fan and have been playing since I was 6. My parents and family have loved and supported me all throughout my life and I’m just so thankful for everything they have done for me. More recently however, my parents moved me out to Seattle WA, where I live with them. Both of my siblings live in New Zealand and due to vivid I haven’t been able to see them for an entire year. I miss them every day and long to see them again. 
Ever since I’ve got here I’ve just been going thru the motions. I go to school where I barely talk to anyone and have no friends, and while I keep a 4.1 gpa, I still hate every second of it. I play for a very good hockey team but I just haven’t rlly been into it as much as I used to be. Not like I have a bad team, there all great ppl, but it just hasn’t been the same. 

Along with that, I’ve just had constant feelings of sadness and angst and anger. Just out of nowhere. I get mad at the smallest things and snap at ppl where I used to never do to. What hasn’t helped is just the fact all my friends I considered to be my closest friends have all ditched me. I ask all of them to talk or play video games or something but it’s just constant rejection. Some come up with excuses while others j flat out say no. I’m so tired of the feeling. Rejection. My entire life I’ve felt it, not being good enough, and it just hurts the same every time. 

Adding fuel to the fire, I constantly have been struggling with my place in the world and extremely tough concepts such as religion and mortality. 

The only ppl I consider to care about me at this point seems to be my close family (parents, siblings) 

Constant stress and anger coupled with lack of motivation and sadness have made my life a living hell. Anyway I thought I would share on here as a last resort before the hotline."

I’m going to lose my job due to this, and I pretty much loathe myself for what I’ve done. I’m so ashamed of myself. 

The person I’ve been seeing for a year and a half knows all this and hasn’t once asked to see me. He still messages me, but even though he knows I’ve at times been pretty much suicidal, he hasn’t come to see me, hasn’t asked to see me, hasn’t made any plans to see me. 
This is over, isn’t it? 
If things were reversed, I would definitely have gone to see him at his lowest. I would have made him a priority. He hasn’t made me a priority at all. I’m not sure what’s 100 steps under a priority, but that seems to be where I’m teetering for him. 

I’m disappointed. In myself for what I did (no excuses, I fucked up massively) and disappointed in him. I expected better from him, but this isn’t the first time he’s badly let me down. 

If he doesn’t want to be with the type of person who’s been arrested for drink driving, then fair enough. I don’t blame him. But he should say that instead of just texting me mundane shit all the time.

I've never had a shoulder to cry on. I've never had someone be there for me and notice when I'm down, but I can always do that and be there for others. It makes me sick how I can treat someone better than I treat myself and how they treat me as well. 

I have no one. I hate the world we live in. I hate myself. I want to be someone else.

musicaltoezz,2021-11-14 06:47:06+00:00,My good friend killed himself 8ish years ago.,"I really wish he was here now. We had to go our separate ways for a while, but the place I was in when I met him was so low and we were there for each other. I feel very low and alone again and I really wish he was still around to be an understanding friend. I like not having to pretend. It was a miracle we met. I feel like I can't trust anyone. My old friends aren't around. I have a hard time letting new people in. I just don't know what to do. I should probably start with getting sober. Drinking brings me down. Miss you Eli. Sorry I wasn't there for you. I feel like I can't take anymore loss. But people are going to continue to leave."
LumiGloomy,2021-11-14 00:59:46+00:00,I’m realizing how my family hasn’t been there when I needed them and it’s taking a toll.,"We went through a pretty bad separation and divorce when our dad left. My mom and sister were both suicidal as a result of it all. I guess I never let that go. 

I’m terrified of losing my mom and recently with my depression at its highest my mom coming home everyday absolutely exhausted and overwhelmed and crying. I can’t breathe. I can’t control my mood, I get triggered so easily by the people around me, my mood just plummets. I smile and comfort her everyday then my mask drops when I walk away. 

I don’t reach out to people when I need help anymore because I always feel like I have bad timing. Like they’re going through something I’m not just gonna dump my issues on them. But when things got really bad the past few days and my mom’s reaction was “I don’t know what to do for you this is why you were in therapy.” When I broke down because I had to hide in the closet from our landlord who came into our house without permission. I didn’t need advice I just needed to be hugged. 

I’m so scared to talk to her because when I was younger and told her I was hurting myself she said she needed me to leave her for a bit and that she feels like she failed as a mother. I don’t want to hurt her like that. I don’t tell her I hurt myself I don’t tell her anything in my head. When I break in front of her it was only ever about my dad or anxiety over something happening that is making me feel like I’m going to die. 

She didn’t understand when I was hyperventilating on my birthday because I couldn’t handle the anxiety of everyone looking at me and expecting me to be happy when I couldn’t that day. 

She doesn’t understand that when I’ve asked her 4 times to help me take the dishes out of my room for months is because it’s such a big overwhelming job to me I haven’t been able to do it yet and not a joke to teasingly mock about. 

And my brother who isn’t helping with the situation right now but instead always going out with friends and saying he’s moving out in 6 months so it doesn’t matter. 

When my dad left we only had each other we would always protect each other. But now it just feels like I’m being abandoned by the only people I have left. I’m not even asking much I just needed a hug and a little help cleaning."

TiltilizingSlide,2021-11-14 00:23:26+00:00,Never Have I Wanted To Kill Myself More Than Today.,"I’m in pain, I can’t, I’m constantly uncomfortable because of my hot flashes and I’m cold. I can’t even get out of bed without being in pain and none of this is helping with my depression. Everyday I find it harder and harder to not just kill myself."
sammyontherise,2021-11-13 23:56:38+00:00,Acceptance,"I can’t accept who I am 

Or at least I can’t change who I am, that would be too easy. The constant feelings of stagnation alongside the belittling self-hatred I feel when I watch others evolve and change are justified. These are merely the consequences of my actions, it just so happens that I am the bearer and perpetrator of those consequences. I am what I am. Every negative thought and action I have against myself serves as penance.

Perhaps it’s apt that I am the perpetrator of my own downfall, only I know the full extent of my demons. Everyone, everywhere may feel they can bring justice upon me, but only I can nail myself onto the proverbial cross. I am my foil, my antagonist, my executioner. 

Time is always slipping away, sometimes it’s slow, sometimes it’s fast, but it’s always slipping away. Times arrow is unrelenting and only marches forward after all.

It’s odd to blame yourself for everything, to constantly feel belittling and inferior, to never fully trust what you think. It’s not easy, I don’t even know if I feel like I am me, it’s almost as if I’m watching through the eyes of a zombie, slowly meandering towards their inevitable death. Maybe that is me trying to push away my failings from myself, never being able to accept that I am the catalyst behind my actions despite knowing full well that that is the case. There is always a rift between knowing and accepting. You can’t accept without knowing, but you can know without accepting."
420_Shaggy,2021-11-13 23:23:53+00:00,No one wants me around,"I was text a friend of my ex who I thought was sort of my friend I guess. I asked him how I can earn people's forgiveness and not have them hate me. He said there's no need because no one needs or wants to associate with me. I should have known that and it probably seems dumb to most people, but I barely have anyone in my life and I tend to over exaggerate people's places in my life. So in my warped brain, my ex's friends were somehow important. I was with him for 4 years and their friend ground included everyone else's girlfriends but I was always excluded because my ex would constantly talk shit about me to them and make me seem crazy. I'm desperate for irl friends that I've known for a long time and I thought this person actually cared about me and didn't just be friendly to me because I was with my ex. So it hurt to figure out he actually doesn't give a fuck about me. I don't have anyone in this town. The only person I have is my boyfriend and he's in boot camp and we only communicate with letters. Sorry that this is explained poorly and hard to understand, but I'm suffering immensely and just typed out my feelings."

Admirable_Distance96,2021-11-13 22:53:27+00:00,What do I do?,"I've had history with depression over the past few years. It started in 2017, got significantly worse in 2019, almost killed myself in 2020. Then I got better during 2020 and 2021, all until now. 

I was in a LDR, she helped me get better. I finally saw a purpose in my life. She made me feel useful and important. Fast forward to September 2020, when school started and she started to make excuses to why we aren't able to spend time together. Her constant excuse was that she ""had to study"" when I know for a fact that it was a lie. All of my trust towards her fell apart, everything she said I took with a big grain of salt. The feeling of not being able to trust your partner is awful. I was nervous and angry all the time, I couldn't spend a day without fighting with my family, I distanced myself from everyone. 

We got into our final fight in July where she finally admitted that I didn't matter to her (she didn't say it, but she said it; if you know what I mean). We broke up that day and my life turned upside down. I was a bit sad and heartbroken at first, but it wasn't much. Suddenly, I was feeling happy and relieved. I didn't fight with my folks as much, my social life exploded. A month or two later, I found out she cheated on me. I mean, I knew she did, but I wasn't 100% sure before her friend told me everything. It was a guy ""I didn't have to worry about""... It made me feel worthless. 

I somehow got over it, forgot about it and went to college. Since it started, I haven't even tried to study. At first I was just lazy, but now I don't have the mental strength to put myself to work. I barely exist again. I'm feeling weak, I don't have enough energy to breathe. I don't want to live the life I lived in early 2020. I feel useless, worthless and empty. Nothing brings me true joy ever since college started. I wanted to give myself a year off, to focus on myself and build my character, but my parents just didn't give me an option. I was shouted at when proposed this. I can't take the stress anymore. I didn't have a good week since April. I need rest so much. I was busy even during summer... I worked my ass off to get some money to buy myself a car (which I've wanted for as long as I can remember). I didn't get my dream car, but it's not far from it (my dream car is a 1st gen VW Golf). And work left me mentally exhausted. Imagine hiding your true mental state while having to handle hundreds of extremely stupid and heavy tourists a day with a big smile on your face. 

The worst of it all is - I can't tell anyone. No one would understand and those who would are fucked up enough even without my burden. So everyone just keeps invalidating my suffering without even knowing they do it. I don't know what to do or how to react to all of this, it's just too much for my weak ass at this moment. All I want is some time off."

Lately I’ve been feeling more and more down my birthdays coming up it’s been 7 years since my dad left and it always hits me bad when my birthday comes around I wish he would’ve never left maybe my life could’ve been different I regret a lot of things that I’ve done that have lead up to this point.

I’m in 2 year relationship with age (19)f we live together with my mom. I ended up dropping out of school at (15) so I could support us and I was able to find alright job that gives me the afternoons free but lately I’m not feeling our relationship anymore I’m so unhappy I feel numb. I feel like it’s better if we break up, I feel like I need to find myself and find self love before I can love someone else. The only thing is she deals with depression too and knowing her mental state when we’re over she likely to go in a deep dark hole as I am the only one who’s she’s truly opened up too,she’s been though a lot and I give it to her for trying to push through but I can’t anymore. She stays at home cleans our room and takes care of our dogs while I’m at work and I’m the only one bringing income to our house hold but we’re literally always broke, i make around $2,000 a month but I have to pay my car which is $500 and I go half of the rent with my mom which is another $500 ,I get payed every two weeks which leaves us only $500 for two weeks until I get payed.I know we rushed out relationship and I regret it what can I do now. We also have a problem we have sex almost everyday and it doesn’t feel like the loved there anymore i have to imagine I’m with someone else in order to bust I’m ashamed .I’m tired I don’t wanna keep going anymore ,then with everything else going on I feel like soon if something isn’t done ima end up taking my life,what’s the point I’m tired of feeling the same way everyday… What do I do her mom also stays with us because she used to live here in Alabama but then she moved to cali and then came back and has been working and living with us but hasn’t gave us a dime to help pay with the rent of bills.

I had a friend in the neighborhood who I used to go on walks with. We both used to talk about how our day went and had impromptu venting sessions. it felt good. but ever since he moved away, i feel lonely at times. and feel like a lot of stuff gets piled up. he tries to connect on call, and keeps a check on me and I do the same, but i don't feel like messaging or calling everyday. 
I have PCOS for which i was making lifestyle changes but I no longer feel like working out. or eating right. ive been eating a lot. and it makes me even worse. I am not doing great academically but i am still able to manage it. i don't know what exactly it is but i have been feeling really low. i meet my friends, had my fav cousin stay at my place and even though i dont look forward to it, i feel just ok or even good when im with them. but something creeps in when im alone. i feel weird to call it ""feeling depressed"" but once my therapist told me that i have phases of depression and it freaked me out. but it got okay. but i still don't know if im miserable enough to say that im depressed. 
i need to resume therapy. but it's also sad to be back at square one.. i mean not really cos at least i can identify things that are wrong but i do feel like ugh all of it again."

Possible_Late,2021-11-13 10:32:36+00:00,I don’t feel real,"Just asking for help with trusting a new girlfriend and letting her become part of my life. I’ve always been slow to let people behind my walls after my long time ex cheated on me extensively my default setting has been to keep people at arms reach. Sure I’ll let them in but I view everyone as a temporary part of my life. The future scares me. Commuting scares me. Making plans scares me. I easily feel trapped by the life I lead. It’s even small things like I don’t decorate my car so I can leave at any moment, I have a cheap shit box I bought in cash so I could leave at any minute. With friends, sos and family I tell them “deep” things but they mean nothing. I truly feel like if I lost any of the people I cared about sure I’d be sad but I wouldn’t care in the big picture. The flip side of this is I’m not excited about anything. I’m just generally and emotionally flat. I’m not invested in anything or anyone and thus I’m half assing my way through life. The only things that I feel strongly about are small things like the gym, audio books etc. I feel like I live for my dinner and my favorite YouTube channel. I feel like I have no soul I just feel dead inside. It’s really negatively affecting my current relationship with my new girlfriend. She’s really sweet and amazing and if I focus on being present with her she makes me so happy just existing with her. But my autopilot runs behind walls. It feels like life is a video game or a movie and I’m just watching and interacting with the events on it from behind a screen. I get more invested in books, dreams and movies than my own life. I need help. My therapist just says I have to try to let people in but if it was that easy I would have done it. I feel so alone."

I am a very friendly and nice person. I’m only 17 but people my age and years older like to talk to me idk why but it’s most likely because I get along with everyone. But when people see this they think all these people that talk to me are my friends. 

I’m just chill with them. That’s all. And me laughing and being happy ends the second I leave school or a event and head home. I’m depressed and lonely. I don’t go out or talk to anyone. 

People come to me with their problems all the time because I listen. I’ve been though it and give good advice. 

I wish I could talk to someone about my problems. I don’t know how to talk to people about my problems or start the conversation. Idk maybe I can talk to someone on the internet so I won’t be judged or they might understand so it’ll be easier to start the conversation.

I guess what I’m trying to say is never judge a book by its cover."

troubledman123523,2021-11-13 04:10:51+00:00,looking for advice,"Hey, I'm a 17-year-old turning 18 soon. As I'm getting closer to 18, the more I keep thinking about the future. It's at the point where I can't sleep sometimes. I know I'm young, but I have nothing in mind about what I want to do. The more I look through photos and things about the past, the more I realize that time won't stop. It's eating me alive. It feels just like yesterday that the pandemic happened, yet it's already been two years. I'm afraid that before I know it, I'll be stuck with a job that'll eventually lead me to be even more depressed.

I'm young, and I've been told by my closest friends that we have so many years ahead of us to decide and figure stuff out. However, they all have dreams and things they want to do. Unlike them, however, I have nothing noteworthy to talk about. I'm average in every way. I'm a guy who's unathletic, average-looking, has average grades, and has no skills or talents to speak of. I keep dreading the moment I finish high school. Nothing will ever be the same. I won't be able to laze around or hang out with friends as frequently anymore.

I have a great life, though. I have a loving family, good friends, and I'm living comfortably. But why is it I feel down whenever I think about the future or realize that time continues to move on and I'll soon have to take up responsibilities as a responsible adult? I have nothing to be depressed about. Yet why is it I feel this...sad? I refuse to talk to my family about this and no matter what, I won't. Opening up is hard for me. I feel like I have to put a mask on and hide my feelings. The only reason I'm writing this post and sharing is that no one knows me.

Although I said I want advice, this post is really me just venting, and letting all my frustrations out. Thanks for reading my rant."

The thought never goes away and while other people would have moved on to another topic, I’m stuck on the same thought. This makes it awkward because I can’t think of anything to talk about. The more I think about it, I’ve always been this awkward. It wasn’t until my freshman I decided to say fuck it.

I had to put down my favorite dog in August, my father past away in October and my wife had back surgery in November. I have a lot more to do every day taking all the house work and care for my wife. Dads birth day was this week and its been hard to function, called out yesterday and today. I was not able to make it back home to see him before he passed adn that feels horrible. Talked with my mom last night and her sadness makes me tear up. All that on top of the depression I fight all the time. I'm going back to bed."
xvadax,2021-11-12 18:21:25+00:00,Failure to Launch; I can't get over the fact that I am not sixteen anymore. How do I cope and accept it?,"For some reason I stunted at sixteen years old. I am twenty two and a classic failure to launch. I'm female. 

Age sixteen.... This was the year that I went through a traumatic experience with my family who have all moved on from it. I feel disconnected from the situation and I am not sure if it has affected me... I like to forget about it. It's not like I can talk to them about it anymore as it was spilled milk.

I also saw myself turn from medium depression to full blown suicidal thoughts, and told nobody about them, not even now. My mother is a complete overreactor and professional victim, so it's absolutely not an option. 

I have seen myself regress in age over this past year. I went from having a job, to quitting due to mental illness which is frankly free ranging itself as I don't want to take medication for it. My country is having a mental health crisis meaning they won't take in new clients and I have no money for it. The philosophy is to meditate and you'll be cured...

As for the age regression, I have begun loving kid things from my childhood like Barbie, Bratz and etc. I even collect plush bears and snow globes because they make me feel happy. 

I have never been a normal young adult. I lost all my friends when I quit school at sixteen, I have now got my high school pass as I did it online. When I left school, I wasn't contacted by my so called friends about why I disappeared, but I guess that is double sided.

At the moment, I feel like I have nothing to live for. I wish I was sixteen and young again. I wish I had time to figure things out but I don't. I have to get my life together like every other adult out there. 

As my parents owe me a lot of money (tens of thousands) I can live at home for as long as I wish, but it feels wrong... even though I know I am not ready, but I am supposed to be at this age like everyone else. I would be lonely and severely depression on top of it, if I did move out. I have no idea where to go or where I belong.

I have never been in a relationship, date or had any male be interested in me ever. I barely leave the house either. I didn't want a relationship until I turned 21, and even then I am not sure if I want one or the idea of one. Maybe I feel like I haven't hit common milestones that young adults do such as date and losing virginity. I have sort of given up with it as I fear being taken advantage of and getting heart broken.

As I get older these things only become bigger red flags. Despite all this, I am fairly mature and smart, but at the same time inexperienced and feel emotionally immature compared to others my age who are going out drinking, and dating whilst I sit at home. 

I am currently doing a course for my future career, but I can't help stress about the future. I can't drive... I just feel like a giant kid, and struggling to launch. Life feels worthless. I am trying to tell myself to not take it so seriously, but it is hard."

throwawayBPDsa,2021-11-12 13:25:51+00:00,I’m destined to live a shitty unfulfilling life and not much could be done about it,"I’m 27 now, single, never been in a relationship with limited friendships and shitty social skills.
been mentally unstable for years, mood swings, intense anxiety and that sort of shit that bruises relationship and push people away, even though I have never been in any conflict or stormed of on others but the way I shut off freaks people out.
put all my dreams and life on the hope of leaving my country into a more open and accepting one, but now is off the table as in no fucking way I’m going to survive that or be able to achieve it.
now, I got nothing. can’t have a relationship given my sexuality, can’t even build any friendships or relationships with others. people can’t stand me and I’m an idiot. 
killing myself would save me the trouble but in no fucking way I’m going to do that to my family.
I tried multiple therapists and currently following with one for years, tried multiple medications, tried to eat better and exercise and lost a lot of weight, but non of that shit would change the trap that I’m in.
nothing will cure my gayness, give me back the time I wasted depressed instead of living and build a healthy personality and social skills. 
I am destined to be an embarrassment, a waste of life, a bitter loser and nothing will ever change that. all I care about and have to protect is not to be a burden. 
fuck me and my stupid pathetic life.
I can’t even express myself and thoughts properly. 
I fucking wish life ends somehow."
getzmeacupcake,2021-11-12 11:23:33+00:00,Just so tired,"I am just so tired. Out of sheer stubbornness I have forced my way through all my life’s daily obligations and caring for my family.
I love them, but I don’t think they like or love me. 
I don’t have friends who I talk to now. If I do, I don’t talk to them. Why bother, everyone has problems. I haven’t felt this isolated in years. 
No one truly hears me. I am not young, I know how to handle and cope with depression. I am not smart, nor I am unintelligent. 
But, suddenly my depression seems to be handling me and my life. 
I don’t want to even try to talk to anyone. I have tried so many times. Like I said everyone has problems…. I am so tired of trying to live with people who don’t want to really know me or each other, unless it’s on there terms."
Forever_Lonewolf,2021-11-12 10:48:52+00:00,To the Psychiatrist for a first time,"I finally booked a psychiatrist. I've wanted to do it for years, it's a pity she won't take me until after the new year. I hope I can handle it until then.

I went to the psychologist for a half a year and it didn't help at all so I hope the psychiatrist is better.

I just need something to stop the panic and fear I have every day when I wake up.

Wish me luck."
Routine_Specific_892,2021-11-12 08:41:02+00:00,School,"I went to the doctor 2 days ago and they diagnosed me with depression (I think thats how you say it) Im a kid in high school and i have been suffering from it for a while now. The doctor and my mom told me that I should go to my counselor at school. Part of my depression is making me not wanna do anything i just feel super unmotivated and i get distracted at school a lot. So for that i have really shitty grades (all f’s) 

One of my friends told me that if i go to the counselor they might cut me some slack for my grades because of how im feeling and i was just wondering if thats true.

Thanks in advance"

LumiGloomy,2021-11-12 04:27:07+00:00,Ranting about my horrible day.,"My family rents a house and the weather has been awful. Our house reflects our mental state and how exhausted we are to properly take care of things. Over time it just builds up and it’s a struggle to make our private lives presentable to the landlord. 

It’s been raining heavily all day and new leaks have shown up. My mom briefly mentioned it to the landlord’s wife and she basically said the landlord is coming over and needs to see it. But if you don’t explain things very clearly my mom won’t understand. That happened today, she didn’t understand the landlord was coming over and wanted to see inside the house. She thought he would need to look at the top of the roof, not the leaks inside the house. I knew otherwise and started to panic. There’s no way to fix the house in what was less than hour to be presentable and keep us out of trouble. And I’m the only one home. 

I’m aware I’m not ok, I’m aware I have extreme depression and anxiety and react abnormally to situations. So when the landlord started knocking on the door I entered a flight or fight mode and crawled into my closet to feel protected. It was the first time I’ve ever hid in there and I’m happy I did. 

I never trusted my landlord because he’s a stranger to me and I know he’d be mad at the state of our house. Because there was always something to hide I was paranoid of him entering without permission. He’s never before unlocked the doors to let himself in but he always held that power. Today he used that power. 

The moment I closed the door and sat down in my closet he unlocked the front door and entered the house. So for ten minutes I’m in my closet hiding from him as he looked into every room calling out to see if anyone was home. 

There were moments I could’ve left the closet and approached him sure, but I didn’t want to. I didn’t have answers for why the house looks bad, why I didn’t answer the door, why I didn’t come out and see him sooner. I didn’t even realize I was shaking till my breathing was loud and I had to tell myself to calm down and cover my nose so when he came into my room he wouldn’t hear me. Even after that I just sat with my head on my knees suddenly calmer the whole situation feeling surreal. 

Luckily he never actually came into my room or turned the light on and he finally left the house. That’s when I started to panic a little bit because I didn’t know if he would come back or bring his wife. I was texting my mom while this was happening and at that point I begged her to come home early because I couldn’t be alone and I didn’t want to leave the closet, I didn’t know what to do if he came back and found me. She said “Grr. Fine” when I convinced her to come home early. 

Another 20 minutes pass and she told me she just got on the bus. I was pretty ok in this moment, my mom is coming, it’s been quiet. Then my cat comes back into my room meowing. He knew I was in the closet because he watched me get in and ran away to hide himself since he hates strangers. I peek out the crack and he is staring at me in the dark. I felt terrified. The gap seemed so much larger than I thought and I felt hunted and exposed. I’m not scared of my landlord, I don’t think he will hurt me. And that’s what I told myself while he was in the house, I’m not in immediate danger. That might be why I never had the urge to cry until that point. I pushed it down and continued waiting. 

I had hid in the closet for an hour and a half. Because I didn’t feel safe to leave or even ready when my mom did get home. My mom is upset because her work and home life is ruins right now, I comfort her. We say we’ll figure something out in a couple hours and I leave her to rest. I went back to my room and just stared at where I sat in the closet. I texted my siblings not to do anything to upset our mom today and told them the landlord came in so we’re in trouble. 

They yelled about what he did was illegal and that we need a 24 hour notice. And it was and we do. And that’s why they didn’t immediately yell at my mom because they know the landlord made the wring move there and as far as they know the house was empty…. 

I actually laughed about this thinking “it’s such a me move to hide while someone comes in the house” and that because they didn’t know I was there I was like a secret agent. 

The thing is I’m starting to feel the affects of what happened and my family aren’t batting an eye. I’m sitting in bed spacing out and covering my ears with no thoughts. And they don’t see a thing. No one asked if I’m ok. No one hugged me. No we don’t think I was in danger but I just hid from a stranger who entered my house without permission. That’s not normal. How I reacted wasn’t normal and could’ve been prevented if we just got our stupid home in order. 

I still don’t feel scared but I almost don’t believe it even happened. It’s taken all night and in the process of writing this to even react to what I went through and sob in my mom’s arms. She doesn’t even know what to do with me I’m so broken she doesn’t know how to help me anymore. That’s why I need therapy and I was getting it for a bit but my therapist suddenly shut our appointment down and talked about sending me to someone new just because I didn’t what to tell her what thoughts on a daily basis are like, I was willing to talk about anything but that. But she misunderstood and talked about my ability to talk and be therapy ready so she made me feel like I got kicked out of that appointment and waste my moms money and felt unwelcome as her patient."
Wh3tsth3point,2021-11-12 04:11:23+00:00,Idk if this makes sense,"I feel relived and comfortable when I'm in a really bad depressive state. I feel less anxious and more like myself? I don't know how to explain it, it's weird. When I'm in a really bad place I suddenly feel like I have no responsibilities and stress free, just empty af(no thoughts)."

idkwhyimherern20,2021-11-12 02:44:59+00:00,I think my mind is unhealthy (F21),"Hello everyone that's willing to read this. I'm M, a 21 years old woman. I don't know what to do right now. I have been feeling depressed for seven years already, due to my home situation. But I don't want to go into detail about that now. I actually have a question for everyone:

Is my mind being unhealthy?

See, I never tell my friends and people i love how I feel about them. But whenever someone I dislike interferes with our plans, I always ens up feeling mixed. Like, my friends have all the rights to hang out with whoever they want and speak to who they like. I know that. Still, If anyone messes with us I think about being better off dead?

Now, I'm very aware that this isn't normal. But still, I want to ask what it is and why I react like this? Am I wishing to be liked more than someone I dislike? Is it just mixed jealousy? Or is something really wrong with me? 

Again, I never act on this. It just pops in my head and I end up feeling incredibly lonely when the people I like talk to someone i don't like at all. I don't really get it myself and that's why I'm here today. 

To be clearer I'll give you a situation: a girl i don't like is speaking to a person I like a lot. Still, the girl I don't like thinks we're friends and I'm kind to her not to be shady, but because I don't see the point in fighting, Now, whenever this person I like speaks to the one I dislike i feel this twist in my stomach and immediately feel sad. But I'm not in love with this person either, because the person I like is a friend. The person I dislike also makes me very annoyed by always sharing their conversations with me, even when I tell them I don't wanna see it.

On top of that, if I feel ignored I just think i'm better off not existing at all. Again, I don't act on it nor do I hurt myself but it's just very annoying? Because I know there's no reason for me to behave the way I am. It's just an emotion I can't ignore and makes me want to leave my friend group all together. But then again, I love these people and cherish them too much to leave, as I'll just miss them in the end? 

Can anyone give me advice or help me out? I don't know what to do with this. It's starting to get unbearable."
ElHijoDeHollywood,2021-11-12 02:35:59+00:00,No one wished me a Happy Veteran’s Day,Army vet. I’m not trying to shill but I just wanted to get this out instead of internalizing it. I didn’t get one Happy Veterans day greeting. I suppose it’s my fault because I pretty much excommunicated most of my friends and family after my ex asked for a divorce on Christmas day shortly after I got home from deployment. And the few people I do talk to didn’t say anything. Bottom line it’s just kind of a bummer.

WesternNo187,2021-11-12 00:37:42+00:00,SSRI yes or no?,"So recently I was diagnosed with severe depression and high anxiety. I've dealt with both to be honest for most of my life.

I've come to realize that my baseline is basically sadness 95% of the time.

The campus doctor wants me to try SSRIs but I dunno I'm super nervous and scared because of all of the potential negative side effects.

For most of my life I've been gaining tools to manage but these last few months my anxiety especially has caused me to have multiple panic attacks.

A lot of the things making me sad are circumstances that are beyond my control. Anyways I guess I'm just looking for advice. Have you used SSRIs? Should I push past my fears and use them. Ahh

I say things on here just so that someone can hear me, because I can’t tell the people close to me because anytime I do I make a fool of myself. That’s all I am now, and apparently my friends feel the same. And can see what they mean, I’m saying that I quit while at the same time ranting on Reddit so that I’ll feel less alone knowing a stranger hears me. So that someone I’ve never spoken to before can say it’s good to vent sometimes. I think I’m going to stop using this community, because no matter what I do or how hard I try with whoever I meet, I’m always just a phase."

Idk how im supposed to feel, I've literally lost a family member or a friend every year to months apart for the last 5 years.
I lost 2 aunts, 2 uncles, my cousin, my grandfather one of my closest friend.

I lost my cousin and never told him what a friend he was. I was so lost that I isolated myself then his mom, my aunt killed herself not even a month after and I never got to tell her how much it wrecked me that he was gone then she was. So I kept running away then her husband my uncle died a few months later. I remember driving over an hour to bring him some pizza because it was one of his favorite foods.

I tried to move on my mother who I was estranged to assaulted me, I guess it wasn't enough that her ex husband did the same. I got arrested from my mother assaulting me, it cost me a good job opportunity and my current girlfriend.

So I moved on moved away, got a good job, then another aunt died who I was closer with. I remember the call I remember crying for hours and spending the night drinking by myself.

I tried to reconnect with my family because I needed someone and had nobody, they were distant so I went to live with my uncle who recently lost his wife, my aunt, then while I was states away my grandfather who raised me after my family kicked me out died, the hospital killed him. They let him fall and didn't report it, he had internal bleeding in his brian and died due to the negligence. I was devastated so I came home.

I moved in with an old friend, but because I was burying my trauma I lashed out at him one day and destroyed our friendship, broke the lease and left.

Then my uncle died, I felt like I was suffocating at this point.

I tried to get a better job, I tried to get better, to buy things to complete me, sought out a relationship but then like always I isolated myself and drove them away.

I was broken was getting ready to commit suicide when I got the call that one of my closest friend beat me to it. The one friend who I could always talk about my mental issues because we were both struggling.

I'm basically on suicide watch at this point."

I might share a cell with rapists and murderers simply because I refuse to contribute to a fascist country that kills innocents and enslaves teenagers. 

I just spent the little I had left after the $800 loss for a bottle of vodka because drinking is the only thing that helps me to forget about all of my troubles.

Stop trying to make me feel guilty that I can’t appreciate the good things in my life and only focus on the bad. Clearly if the good was good enough I wouldn’t feel that way. I know I have good things in my life and I try to focus on them but it does nothing so as a result it makes me feel worse because that’s not even good enough. I hate that I have kids because I don’t want to be here however I don’t want to leave them behind. So now I’m just stuck living this miserable existence with a brain that is no good.

They all know I'm lying all the time to them they always tell me I look sad and I lie saying that it's just how I look. All I've ever wanted is to be truly loved and I fucked up my only two chances for it. Adore left me because of my direct actions and Tony left because I couldn't get over someone who never even loved me in the first place. They're only around because they're too nice to abandon me and they know I'm completely alone. I know they hate me and can see what I really am but I'm so starved of any contact I can't let them go. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. I just wish I could tell adore and Tony how much I miss them and how wrong I was.

It might be my fault because I can be very cold and I don't look welcoming but I really like hugging touching being cared for. I'm 16 and didn't want to post on r/teenagers bcz I won't be taken seriously. I grew up with a mom that didn't hug me, tell me I was pretty, asked me how my day was. I was abused my my other parent so initiating physical contact feels uncomfortable but I do like it. I haven't felt cared for in a long time. One time a guy told me I was pretty and sweet and that was the first time I felt a sincere compliment. I know I'm young and hopefully someone will come around and make me feel loved but for now I just have myself. I notice it everywhere I go. My friends care for me but I don't have a loud personality so I'm not their priority, my peers and people I'm public won't even glance at me. I just want a little bit of attention. Even if I don't feel it's sincere, just knowing someone is thinking about me might be good. It might be unrealistic but when I see people I think ""damn they're pretty, they're smart, they have a nice personality, they have nice hair, they're brave, they're fearless"".

I wouldn't shoot myself in the head with a gun because you can get unlucky and live through that but with new disabilities. Unless it was a shotgun I guess? Slitting your wrists is a long drawn out process, where you'd have time to regret it and call an ambulance, so not that either.

I think the best way would be if you had access to heroin or fetenayl and overdose on it. I'm assuming you'd be pretty unaware afterwards. 

This is all hypothetical of course. Just want to hear others thoughts."

I am nineteen years old and I have not been able to find any friends during that time. I didn't deal with it that much before, but the older I get, the more it bothers me. Plus, I'm a big introvert, so I don't think it'll ever get better. I've never had a girlfriend and I don't even know if I'll ever have one. When I see children as young as thirteen years old on the Internet and I didn't even get a kiss at nineteen, it's really depressing. I don't know if I'm disgusting or if I just can't get any. . I am not able to find a job, I have been going to a psychologist for over five years, who no longer helps me much. Virtually my whole day is bored and waiting for the evening to go to bed to sleep. At nineteen, I should enjoy life, going out with friends to celebrate, but instead I'm sitting at home hoping something will change. I know that if I sit at home and do nothing, nothing will be solved. But I just can't come to someone else and start talking to him. I'm afraid I'm strapped. Or go to the girl and start getting closer to her. I have no reason to live at all. I'd rather commit suicide, but I can't do it because of my only family left. It would be selfish of me. I'd rather suffer to death. My family can't blame me for being incompetent. My dream is to have a couple of good friends, a girlfriend who would understand me and take me for who I am and be happy.

Acceptable_Heart_212,2021-11-10 21:13:05+00:00,I just want to kill myself and maybe that way I will stop hurting those I love the most. Please I just need someone who understands me.,"
I’ve been struggling with depression for a year now. This last 6 months have been some of the hardest to deal with, I wanted to kill myself 2 months ago but was to scared to actually do it. I’ve been pushing everyone around me and I didn’t even realized it when my gf told me that I was. 
Yesterday me and her had an awful argument, and it was all my fucking fault. I told her something so hurtful and horrible that I can’t even believe I was capable of saying such horrible things to the most special and dearest person in my life. I love her so much and she’s been so patient and empathetic with me all this 6 months I don’t even know how to make things like they were before I got worst with my depression and anxiety. 
She gave me another opportunity to make things right and I really don’t want to lose her, not because of my depression. I’m so afraid I’m going to fuck up and right now I don’t even feel capable of doing it I feel useless and dumb. 
I feel like I’m losing everyone I love, because I’m a horrible person to be around. I’m always mad, irritated or sad. I feel like a fucking burden to everyone in my life and I just want to make this feeling of guilt, shame, anger and sadness go away. Sometimes I don’t even feel anything I just feel numb. Everything around me is falling part in front of my eyes. I’m failing almost all my classes at university, I don’t even talk to my friends anymore, my girlfriend is getting tired of me and my family just thinks everything is great with my life. I can’t reach to anyone, because I’m to scared I will also lose them. I always tried to be a good and empathic person to those around me I don’t even know what happened to me. I turned into a horrible human being and I just want to end it all. I’m not worthy of receiving love, empathy or anything. I’m a horrible person and a burden to those around me. 

I just want to kill myself and maybe that way I will stop hurting those I love the most. I’m tired of everything and I feel so hopeless about the future. I don’t want to lose the people I love, but I just don’t know how to be the person I was before. I’m so disgusted for whom I’ve become I just fell that killing myself i will stop being a burden and hurting everyone around me who doesn’t deserve under any circumstances to be hurt. 
If I end up killing myself I just everyone around me to know I loved them and that this isn’t your fault. I’m just too weak and hopeless to continue, I’m tired of feeling a void and like I’m a burden that only causes deception and sadness. I’m tired of life and I’m so sorry and ashamed for everything bad I’ve done. 
I loved you all, especially you thanks for everything."

I've applied to so many places and I've heard absolutely nothing yet. I even applied for a promotion in my own company and I still got ghosted. My younger brother just got a job and moved out yet I'm the one who is supposed to set the example. It's so hard to think you're not good enough for anyone or anything when you just keep getting rejected over and over. I'm poor, living at home, working a shitty job, single as fuck, and have no support system (my parents didn't even want me to go back to school). On top of that, I don't even have any prospects despite being a pretty good student which means I have no hope of moving out or on with my life. I really don't want to spiral into this hole of depression and I've been trying so hard to keep myself motivated enough to keep applying to jobs and doing my schoolwork every day, but I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. Especially when you see people around you becoming successful, you have no one who can provide any emotional support, and you simply just don't see much hope for the future of our generation anyway. Someone please give me a reason why I shouldn't just give up searching for happiness in my personal life and do something fulfilling...."

The current holds steady
Waterfall in sight

The unknown and unseen calling

A lifetime of fighting
fighting the inevitable

Not knowing why

The river is all I know

So close to drowning

But yet so far

The current subsides
This time I'll make it to the other side

So naïve

Before I know it
 my legs give out
My hands lose grip

Getting closer to the edge
And wonder

 what's at the bottom

My eyes close
Body goes limp
Let everything go
Breathe in water

And cough it out

How can something seem so easy
And yet be so hard 

Reach out for a rock, a branch, anything
I can almost look down the waterfall

Hands reach out from the river bank
But something won't let me grab them

Take a deep breath
Regain my footing
Hold onto the branch
And dream of the waterfall

And hope the river current takes me there"

i still don’t want to be alive. 

i don’t get it. i have what seems like the perfect life, i even have hobbies and i have great friends who are super supportive with my mental health issues and stuff. 

idk it’s like the world is muted. colours aren’t as bright and i don’t even enjoy listening to music the way i used to. i find myself waking up when it’s almost dark already and unable to get to sleep without drugs. 

people keep asking me what a life i would want to live would look like but i have no fucking clue. this one is pretty damn good. maybe one where my brain fucking works lol.

I love him unconditionally and I want the best for him and this really does seem like the best thing for him. It still sucks and it still hurts.

So when i saw someone in my physics class with healed self harm scars i didn’t expect to feel such heartbreak for this girl that i’ve never talked to. Sadly i wasn’t surprised. For months i’ve been thinking that something about this girl was so familiar. She always seemed so sad, but not the kind of sadness that was clearly evident. After i saw, i went into the bathroom and missed my next class cause i couldn’t stop crying. I can’t even put into words the feelings i had that drove me to self harm for the first time, and the thought of someone else going through that made me feel physically sick.

I am the scapegoat in a narcissistic family and the caretaker for the narcissist, the enabler of an opiate user that steals from me who is also my boyfriend of 7 years.

Recently my narcissist died and as messed up as it is it destroyed me because she was also the person my world revolved around. My family took over once she died and they are like wolves.. not really ever comprehensive of caring about others or love. It was praised in my family to be cold, ruthless, and greedy. I didn’t do so well in those categories. My family threw away any personal items I had because they were mad I got a used car not worth much, that I had paid for. They got everything else, but slashed all my tires anyways. I have no photos, no childhood mementos, and out money for my cars.. yes they hit my old car too and my apartments are going to tow it. I can’t afford to get new tires for it.

My boyfriend has a warrant he is running from. He is the majority of income in my housing situation.

He is suicida…and I’m terrified I’m gonna go home to him overdosed, dead from a gunshot to his head, or him arrested every day.

Today is our anniversary and I have to pony up 800 or we are evicted. That’s all I get. He also said he wanted to Kill himself.

Lonelygirl1997,2021-11-09 04:23:28+00:00,Don't feel well in life,"Anyone feel depressed about themselves? I've been a lurker on reddit so this is my first post and maybe only post. To start, Since I started my adult life, I notice how happy others are with other people or their friends. I feel sheltered and awkward. I don't think I can ever meet someone because: my brain glitches when I talk, I am forgetful, I can't act like an adult (basically being normal). I feel like I can't advance as a smart person. I now have mini break downs because I realized I am alone. No one wants me. 

My parents help with what I say""smart people stuff"" (no I don't call it that, just for this post and in short, finances like IRA,401k stuff that schools SHOULD teach early on). I don't want to be like this. I mess up and do things stupidly, so I can see why they might be scared of me on my own. I try to fix things to prove I am not useless but I end up messing up. So I sit in silence when people ask my about my financial goals or even career goals. I have nothing and am Nothing. People are surprised when I tell them ""I don't know"" which is TRUE. My parents don't really dive deep into things like that but I frustrate them when I ask them to teach me basic financial stuff. I will be given an irritated look when I asked my parents for help, so I back off. I stutter and drag on conversations when its really, they needed short answer to the question. Then one of my parents has to fill in for me. I think its also because if I seem short on the answer, I am viewed as snappy and rude. Also I work in retail so customers need a damn reason again and again after the first answer. Imprinted mentally at this point. Annnd ironically I am doing it again.

With school, I am so behind, I just found a degree that I can actually put my passions to. Everyone is graduating and interning, I can't even get a single volunteer work, I am still in JC and now with covid, I am fuccckkkeeedd until next year when things reopen a bit more. I fucking hate talking to people about school because I truly don't want to talk about how I am doing, I'm not even close to being done. I don't want help from someone that are further in life than me. It actually doesn't encourage me to talk about school with friends. they aren't bragging, I just don't see how it helps my self-esteem to hear you talk about your studies and to be motivated like you. Yes Jerry, I get you are a doctor, now please stop injecting my ham sandwich with medical marijuana.  Now for the readers, its not a punch at you guys who started school later in life, I think everyone finds a path somehow. good luck on your studies! 

For my mental health issues, I see myself living alone, I want to have a family but my personal mental issues and me feeling dumb, I don't want kids. I don't want them to view me as useless. I want to be able to help them with some homework, life skills and so forth. Have you guys notice how some parents (or if you are a parent) talk to their kids with facts or basic information about life stuff. I am scared to be asked a simple question. I think ""wow that parent can actually *talk* to their kids about...."" or ""wow that parent has a better response than me."" If you are a parent, I hope you are having a good day with your family! I really mean it. It makes me happy to see parents doing stuff with their kids. And if anyone posts an asshole response like ""yeah you shouldn't have kids, you sound dumb enough"", thanks... I appreciate it...   I only see myself only good for physical nourishments and shelter. 

For a SO, I would like to be with someone as everyone does deserve a loving SO. I get some people can't handle someone with mental issues, so I accepted to deal with the lonely part atm. To add on how crazy I feel and seem, I was literally thinking of future me being abused by a SO *because* I am nothing. I do have suicidal ideation and NO, I won't act on it. Not even the abused part. Again, I need to vent. I have been to therapy but I was defined as ""undetermined behavioral disorder"" or something like that. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR - I am useless and nobody can handle me. Would rather take me out or be abused because that is all I am good for.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* I just needed to vent because I don't have anyone to express myself like this. Oddly, I prefer reddit because how open some posts and topics relate.  I feel like there is more to being anonymous. And you are wondering why I don't talk to my friends about this kind of issue, I feel like its harder to be open to people that have a better life in your point of view."

williamlee90,2021-11-09 01:19:38+00:00,I am not happy.,"


I don't know where to began, I began to college a few months ago but I don't have much friends there is not so many people to meet in my classes there are always around 10 people.I had few flirts I am good at hiding my depression I didn't scare them off so but their relationship status were complicated and shit so nothing happened. 
I have been diagnosed with major depression 2 years ago I stopped taking medications too because I used to swallow 10-20 pills at once I overdosed 2 times and then I got together and stayed away from pills now I am a casual smoker and a drinker these were much better for me but now it really began to be so hard to get drunk these last few weeks. And I think I have bipolar disorder too because my mood switches so fast from utterly depressed to careless and happy even when I'm walking I feel this mood switches and I am aware of it. I guess sometimes I just fool myself that life is OK I guess but then reality hits again and there is nothing to do... There is no joy no love and everything is meaningless again I don't feel like doing anyhting other then drinking and writing sometimes, I know that I am a very good writer and my art gives me pleasure but I wish that I wasn't because this feels so heavy sometimes...
Sometimes I make music when I am depressed but in the end nothing really matters because I have no good luck in life to be in a good place it may sound pessimistic you may tell me to follow my dream but I am living in a small town and there is no network around me to make it anything out of it...
I can't sleep at nights I drink and I drink but I just lay on my bed spin for thousand times try to sleep sometimes I get too angry and tense I even scream and yell in darkness trying to sleep because I just can't sleep and I get sober and want to drink again because it is never fucking enough...
I wanted to kill myself but I got a loving mama and a brother, I wish to get a deadly illness sometimes so I can fade away and die so this endless pain of train called life stops.
I am not happy, I am in pain and I just wanted to write this to you guys, I am trying so hard but all I can do is putting on a happy face and in the end it doesn't even matter and I am sad, again."
Call-me-maze,2021-11-09 01:13:43+00:00,What depression feels like,"
Real depression is when you stop loving things that you used to love
Its when you silently push everything and everyone you've ever cared about away
Depression isn't about feeling sad it's about the urge to reach out and grab someone but being unable to being surrounded by people but feeling so alone and afraid of judgment 
Trying to stand on your own and not topple over is a feeling that constantly pulls and nags at you when you try to talk and yet you still feel silenced. And the only thing left you to do is cry and you realize everyone else is to busy with their lives to notice and you realise like always your better off alone in the dark."

Desperate-Mud-3131,2021-11-09 01:02:38+00:00,Sometimes people’s advice for “fighting” chronic depression is really annoying,"As the title says, sometimes the self-help advice people give those with chronic depression (or any mental illness really) is annoying bc of how out of touch it is. 

While there are definitely things mentally ill people can and should do to help themselves, I think some people are under the misunderstanding that the point is to get us to just change our personalities or go from one extreme to the other. 

Like, when my therapist tells me to socialize more and try to be more active, she is NOT telling me to make a career change to motivational speaker/gym trainer. She’s telling me to make time for my existing family and friends and take a fucking walk in the sunshine for a few hours every week."

ftssgd,2021-11-08 20:37:23+00:00,Being a short guy is making me consider giving up on women entirely,"I’m 5’6”, 5’7” on a good day. Since high school I’ve felt completely fucking emasculated and unwanted because I’m short. Because of some stupid fucking arbitrary roll of the dice I get to be less of a man and unwanted by fucking 90% of women for the rest of my life. I have to work my ass off just to get girls who aren’t even attractive (overweight, no hygiene, things that can be fixed). And I get to listen to them fawn over tall, big guys occasionally like I’m not even fucking there. So many women seem like they feel that dating me or having sex with me is laughable. I’ve been working out for most of my life and it seems like it hardly makes a difference compared to a guy who is 6”. I have zero fucking confidence so much of the time because of this shit. I have to act like it doesn’t bother me all the time on top of everything. Fuck this shit, I don’t want to live the rest of my life knowing that I’m some girls second choice and that I’ll never compare to a tall guy.

The icing on the cake is these fucking tall guys always thinking they’re the shit and often fucking rubbing it in. They didn’t work for shit but they get all the attention and adoration. And then we have to hear about all this “body positivity” shit for women who are overweight? It’s so fucking backwards. I wish someone would hit me with a fucking bus jesus christ."

I think about quitting my program because I feel like I’m probably the only one who’s like this but I’m so close. I just don’t know anymore."
PatronSaintOfPigeons,2021-11-08 03:26:54+00:00,"I want to be able to work through this, but no matter who I've talked to, I never feel any better, is there any helping me?","Hi people,

I'm writing this as I'm nearing my wits end on this,

I'm a 29-year-old man and about 4 or 5 years ago, I was assaulted by my female partner at the time, amongst other things such as face to face death threats while brandishing a weapon, as well as other such things,

I've been very hesitant to talk about these situations openly as my ex found a post on another account of mine and played it off as a friend found it and that other people might read it, this being during the divorce,

As I'm now safely divorced, legally speaking, I can talk about it as long as no names are involved, as I have no doubt if I did, it could be spun and she would just make a court case out of it for defamation, which would likely go through, my being a man and all,

Anyway, on from that, essentially, I wasn't, I suppose, ""Performing"" to standard, as a result my ex decided that she would kick me multiple times until I was no longer in the bed, bearing in mind I'm much larger than her, so kicking me out of bed didn't require a light touch,

As a result of some common stigmas on men being sexually assaulted, coupled with my fear of her hunting me down online like some internet creep, I've basically been stuck in this loop of thinking and thinking myself to my wits end, and even now, writing it in a place that's meant to be safe for stuff like this I find myself thinking, ""Should I just can this post?"" or ""why am I even still bothering with this?"",

I want to get help, and because of that ordeal, I find it very hard to trust people, and I've been advised anti depressants, but I've tried that and it didn't help, and I want to be able to trust people enough to go and see a psych or something or whoever you see for this, but the idea of trusting even a medical professional with the information that I'm so f\*d up about this and the why of it makes me physically scared,

And I'm relatively safe, I have no doubt about that, physically speaking, but I know she can, I know she has at least the bare minimum computing skills to likely link this accounts name to my old username and find even this, which was originally why I made this account to begin with,

I feel like as a result of that and other things I've witnessed, I've lost enough faith in humanity to make it nearly impossible to connect with someone else to a point where I can feel comfortable not just talking with them about that and other issues in my life, but also being able to actually deal with it,

All the while I have a very good friend who helps me a lot, but even with her, I can talk about everything, but not once have we talked and I've ever felt like I'm actually working through these things or with anyone for that matter, which has me feeling like me giving out all of this and not being able to do anything about it makes me a burden,

I just want to be able to actually be happy again, not just put on a mask."

TheFinalKiwi,2021-11-08 01:52:58+00:00,Whats even the point anymore?,"So I’ve been having a pretty rough time lately. Back in May, my girlfriend of 4 years and I separated, largely due to the fact that I’m completely incapable of expressing my own feelings and when it comes time to say anything, I just can’t find the words in my fucked up head. We were living in an apartment together, and I didn’t want her to stress about finding a new place so quickly so I offered her to stay in the apartment as long as she needed while I slept on the couch in the living room. This ended up being for 5 months where I slept on the couch in my own apartment that didn’t feel like my home anymore. She ended up finally finding a place at the beginning of October, and since then I’ve been on a pretty steady decline. I quit my job as a commercial electrician in August because I could no longer find happiness in a job that I always intended to be my way of providing for my future family. I’ve been struggling to find the motivation to get out and work (rideshare) to cover my now doubled expenses, even when my bank account lives in the red. I fell pretty hard into weed as a way to dissociate from my reality and to have an excuse to stay home, and I’ve since stopped because the anxiety it causes me is too much to handle at times. I’ve cried more in the past few months than I have the rest of my life combined. I cry about all of my shortcomings that lead to my failed relationship and my inability to pick out a single thought when my mind is constantly racing itself. I struggle to find any value that I provide to anyone or anything anymore besides my dog. I love her with all of my heart and I never want her to lose me. I have no friends where I live except for an old coworker that’s twice my age and will be moving away in April. All of my siblings are infinitely more successful than me and I know if I tell any of this to my dad he will be most upset that I gave up on my career. I just find it hard to believe that there is any light at the end of this tunnel and that everything would be so much easier for everyone if I simply weren’t here."
Char0089,2021-11-08 01:36:56+00:00,I'm not where I want to be in life,"Despite that things have improved immensely over the past couple of months, I can't shake the feeling that it isn't enough. I'm not happy or satisfied with where I am. I keep asking myself ""what's the point?"" And I'm having a really hard time answering that question. I feel trapped inside my own mind most of the time. My moments of clarity are rare these days. I just stay distracted with work or hobbies, but lately even those seem to upset me. I can't just be content ever. Nothing ever seems to be enough for me. Then I think about how I'm not chasing my dream and it makes me angrym especially knowing that I don't even have to try that hard to go after it. I know people who have connections and people who would be happy to help me get a foot in the door. Instead I just let more time pass me by. I know I'm going to wake up one day and no longer have the option. Which terrifys me. I just want to improve myself but it seems impossible."
AuroraMaybe,2021-11-07 23:04:42+00:00,I feel so stupid,"I’m on antidepressants prescribed to me from my new doctor and I’m not supposed to be drinking alcohol. It was never an everyday thing, I just went through so much shit in a few months and it’s not a surprise it weighed down on my mental state and depressive.

I only drank alcohol for the fuzzy feeling it would give me, and it made me feel a bit more included. It was only occasional. 

Working in a restaurant made me crave that bitter taste of alcohol and it didn’t help that my cousin would buy a case every few weeks. I went two months craving and on these pills.

She was adamant that I wouldn’t be drinking because the doctor and pharmacy said no.

Last night I called them and they said it was ok as long as I took it slowly. So I drank last night and today has been so.. I don’t even feel right, I can’t do anything today, there’s so much I want to do and get ready for my new job tomorrow but I’m stuck. I regret fucking up my medication for a few drinks.

I called them again today and they said it’s ok, I didn’t drink enough to fuck to the medication’s influence but I feel it did. I’m not too proud of myself rn."
dark_elftress,2021-11-07 22:25:54+00:00,“You’re useless” “you’re worthless”,"Yeah that was said to me today. Even when I put in extra hours to help pay back his parents and my sister. I don’t get paid much at all so it’s really hard to keep up with bills. This whole week I work and I have two doctors appointments. The only days I get free this week is Saturday and Sunday and I’ve worked this weekend so it’s 7 straight days of being an adult and wear my adult pants no matter how much I just want to be in my bed and be left alone. “I’m getting tired of this relationship” no you’re tired of you’re parents being upset with you because you blow your paychecks and don’t know how to save them yet expect me to save your money when it’s in your account. “You don’t help around the house and when you do it’s after a fight” yes that is true, but I cleaned the room, bathroom, fridge, and kitchen last and we’ve been lazy for two weeks and this week we were barely home. I worked between the concerts on very little sleep and the only day you had to work was 2 days ago and I at least did three and I’m working till Thursday with a day for my doctors and Friday I go to physical therapy so I don’t want to hear it. I’ve been working my ass off and don’t know how to ask for a raise of at least two or three dollars just so I can be more of use. I didn’t eat today and the custard my coworker gave me I threw away because I felt I didn’t deserve it. Yet I didn’t tell you that you were fat at the crumb concert or was rude at the boyscott one like you were. I asked my sister for 300 dollars just to get weed and hoodies. And heaven forbid I do anything to make this any better. Just kill me already. You don’t want to be with me? Then don’t sleep in my bed or decide to get high and be nice to me because you’re high. Yet I’ve been so dedicated to you and you make a separate tik tok to talk sweetly to other girls. Or have dating websites or pull up only fans. But if I were to do that I get the boot faster than a tv can turn on. I’ve been working on my weight an have maintained it at 275 area when at peak of my weight I was almost 400. But that doesn’t matter. I need to get back down to 200 and maybe less if I can. No wonder I’m giving up on myself. For the horrible things you have said ring in my head"

Ryder_estranged-lost,2021-11-07 06:21:56+00:00,Missing depression,"so I'm sorry if my story will of offend a lot of you and I'm not down playing anyones suffering. I'm if I even posted on the wrong place.

so my story started roughly 5 years ago when my I first got hit by severe depression(well I've been lonely and depressed all my life for as long as I can remember maybe I'll share that in another post if anyone cares to listen) so this school year end I've always done academically well heck I was even one of the top students in the school but let's face the truth nobody cares about how you are doing when your grades are good. The truth is I never liked school to being in school having to be around people is really exhausting and every time I would sit in the corner and wonder off the other students would make noise which disturbed my own thoughts I felt like I was going crazy and break time I spent alone often I had no friends no did I want to have any. but tenth grade year end my grades starting dropping when I looked at my school report card it didn't sting me much I was more worried about the folk at home. so in my neighborhood I made deals and trades with a few people to get my hands on laptop shitty to most for me it got the job done. so that's when I started to learn code although I had difficulty grasping it at first no teachers or mentors It was just me alone and our common friend Google. it was grade 11 it was hard to learn code because school took up much of my time , then I resulted to writing on school books computer codes like the teacher would teach and I pretended to take notes the other students soon caught wind of this and it became a class joke ; like ""are you crazy , how do you even understand this"" . I didn't care how others felt or thought about me I'm not that shallow lonely as I was. so my heart was broken by crush grade 9 and toyed with me all the way to grade 10 . but so I have only one person I consider homie he convinced me to join WhatsApp (I don't like social media until I discovered Reddit just this year 2021).

so I did not realise that I'd meet someone online who'd became very special and dear to me(2017). she's the only girl who put up with me , most girls just blocked me because I'm boring not a exciting person or the excitement didn't last long with me. but this one kept talking to me even when the topic was boring she put up with me I know I'm very boring and I know I often bore her (and I still do😅) there's a lot I can say about this person but it's not the point. so 2018 my despair
started getting worse my mental health declined suicidal thoughts started picking and I even started hearing voices. through all those days she was there a stranger I met by chance online who could sense that I'm not okay and would try to probe the truth out of me and listen to my selfish ranting she'd give me hears and didn't judge me at all I thought she would've ran for hills given my issues. she would even stay up with with me the entire if my insomnia wouldn't let me sleep she'd be there just to check in on me(stranger from online keep that in mind).

so my grades were a dismal right so I failed grade 11 and repeating 2019 my suicidal thoughts took a turn for the worst unbelievably my suicidal thoughts also helped out a lot my coding skills really took off , I used my suicidal thoughts to be extremely productive . for some reason it was like a reflex everytime I was contemplating suicide I would code and go most days without or barely any sleep . sure I was tired by the next day but I felt better when I was exhausted I suppose I liked torturing myself.

but here's the issue my family saw that I was more obsessed with my PC then my grades. my mother told my uncle's (she's concerned about my future it's fair) you know my uncle's threatened to take my PC away from when it's the reason I haven't given into my suicidal thoughts. like they forgot the part that no one bought it for me and they have the right to take it away. so one day my youngest sibling sister was missing , I just back from school I wasn't having the best day at school and I think I was crying on the inside . I went to my sister's school and come back I got my head bit off for not trying and being told that I care about nothing except that computer of yours . at that moment I almost said something to my uncle but I just held it in because I knew once something is said it can't be taken back that doesn't mean you'll get the same courtesy back. I felt so damn useless I just went back looking for my sibling and I found her she was playing at one of the houses near the school I came back home i just wanted nothing but to die but that happening would cost my fam a lot of money. you know my family ruined something I was passionate about which was my coping mechanism for suicidal thoughts , depression and loneliness. so I packed away my laptop and my heart with it but the girl met online was still there for and my homie.

I thought by putting my laptop away and focussing on school work I'd feel better I realised something I never liked school I just did it for my folk and I can't focus on school so presure mounted on my from every direction . with suicidal thoughts picking up again my mind started racing I started having an idea about inventing a machine it's the only way for me to cope is being productive and over work my . to keep it short I was so obsessed about this machine one night that I designed even in my dreams and the calculations in my dream and the headache I had the next morning I wasn't up to going to school but taking the day off would raise too many questions I held strong and went to school . after school felt like something was wrong with my breathing and I started having a panic attack it was difficult getting to the house my mother saw me I didn't even have the strength to walk but I pushed until I reached my bed where the panic attack lasted an excruciating half an hour. shortly after that the girl online just sent me a message saying , ""are you okay , I feel like something is wrong?"" and I just said I was little sick earlier but I'm okay now.(there's more could say but I'll stop here)

so my issue is I miss my severe depression and suicidal thoughts because in a weird way they're the reason tha gave me drive and kept me motivated. I keep using it to fuel to learn difficult stuff but without it I feel stranded now . it's I really want it to come back anyone ever felt this way and any advice or if believe something is wrong with me it's okay it's fair opinion so have at it....!"

hornybigcok,2021-11-07 04:35:38+00:00,Echos of the pasted,"This is more like me just putting my thoughts on paper than anything else but advise or anything woukd be good as well.


About 4 years ago my ex tried to kill her self by over dozing. She failed but it all went down hill from there.

For background : for 5 years me and my ex dated since we were in year 7ish. It all seemed good to me but only after we broke up and I went through some shit I realised how toxic  abusive and 1 sided the relationship was. Every time I tried to make plans to have good time and make good memories she would decline them or be miserable while doing it. Everytime I said something she didn't like I would get kicked in the balls. I have never been complemented during that hell of a realstionship. Shoudk would break up with me once every few months and I would run back to her begging to take me back and she did each time but she would also talk shit about me to her friends behind my back telling them how good I was and all that while telling me how awful I am.

 October 2018 I think? 

(sorry all the dates are blury I can't remember even the years coz of all the shit) I was meant to pick her up from her house on a Friday so we could go to mine and have a sleep over. It was a nice blue a little chilly day. I was sitting on the steps outside her house waiting for her. I rang the bell few times no one answered. So I wait. And waited and waited. I waited 5 hours till I saw her mum waking towards the house so I asked her where my ex was and she said that she was in the hospital. I asked her where exactly in the hospital. She told me and I took off running to the bus stop and then running more after. I got there. Found the bed she was laying in. I walk in and she looks me in the eyes and says she is sorry and starts crying. That moment is burnt into my memory. I still remember it clear as day. I spend next few days with her till she got to go home. And then everything was good for a month

November 2018. We went to a party in a park where there was loads of people that I haven't seen for about 2 years so we all were  having good time except for my ex she just sat there ignoring me looking at her phone. So pissed off at the fact that I was being ignored I said fuck it and went binge drinking beers with my mates. I have drunk about a create at that point. So shit faced lonely me was seeking so attention from anyone and there was this chick that was getting all touchy with me and all so we went to the bushes to play around. (ik I am. Not proud and I hate myself for it and bla bla bla) basically we made out and we started touching each other, for what ever reason she just dropped down on the floor with her pants down. I assume she passed out so what I wanted to do is pull her pants up to make sure nothing would crawl inside and as soon as I started pulling them up she woke up and said that I raped here. Keep in mind all we have done is made out and liturly barely touched each other. She started crying akaing me what I have done and so on. She ran off shouting that I raped her so I shrugged it off coz I know I haven't done anything. I went back to my mates and thenankther girl from the party got in my face shouting how I could have raped her and bla bla bla. I don't remember what happened next but I remember I ran after my ex to tell her my side of the story coz I wasnt too consundersd with the relationship at that point but I wanted to make sure she knew that I didn't rape anyone. Then next thing I remember this dude got in my face about something and I already was frustrated so I punched him in the face I think? I think I punched him first but idk? So basically out of no where about 15 people circled me and jsut started beating the shit out of me. Some how I didn't break anything. I crawled to berger King that was on the other side of the street washed off my face coz I had my chin split opened from getting kicked in the face few times. And I called my mum to pick me up. We went to ER to get me sorted and went to police station to make a statement. Nothing came out of that statement. 

2018-2020 

At that point I have lost everything. Absolutely everyone and everything no social life what so ever so I joined cadets and focused on that. I got some random people wanting to fight me once in a while or name calling. Whole school turned against me. Got kicked out of all friend groups so I liturly had no one. 

I luckily doing a lot better now but I do intreducess myself with a nick name rather than my name for obvious reasons. Got into a realstionship it's nearly been 2 years we have been together and it feels so much better and so different compared to my ex. Made loads of new friends. Some old friends came back after realising how shit my ex was and what not.  So that's good. 

But I still do get shit for all of that. I remember going numb for a year and a half after all tgta shit happens. I just kinda zoned out and never zoned back in. I do feel like I am not good enugh for my gf and I do feel like I will fuck shit up again and I do get moments when I jsut relive all those events and this year was the first time I cried after being in very bad and deep depression for 6 and a hf years. I have been depressed since my and exs relationship happened and idk if I have healed yet"

throwawaycount1917,2021-11-07 00:51:45+00:00,So I should have gone to an asylum or something like that basically?,Just learned that if I told the doctor I saw a few month ago  that I had suicidal thoughts and that I already tried to off myself (which I almost Sayed ) he would have been legally forced to contact another organism so that I could have been sent in an asylum? Well I was wondering if I was going to try to see him again to tell the truce this time but fuck no I guess I will continue to fight alone

I can’t imagine all the disturbing and sad things you must experience. Plus, I wonder what you even do when someone describes a situation that you think is completely hopeless as well. I’m probably going to text one of those suicide prevention things today because I can’t stop thinking about how much I want to die. But, I was thinking about the people on the other end, and I was like damn. It must be so hard."

Affectionate_Cry_851,2021-11-06 16:52:07+00:00,I want to leave,"I’ve been having some thoughts lately and I don’t know if it’s spiritual growth but, I’ve been thinking about leaving it all behind and starting a new life. The people that know me and the things I have become attached to are causing me immense stress. People treat me as the person I was, but I’m not longer that person, which is why I think I’ll never be respected in this world. As a result, I find myself continuously chasing these ego oriented goals, achievements or approval from the world and again, it causes me a great deal of stress.

I I don’t really know what my purpose is. I may have an idea, but I don’t know if it’s a stepping stone to a bigger purpose in the end. There are things I was great at, there are things I feel like I was the best at, then there are these moments I look at someone doing something great and say.. I can do that. I just get inspired. But is it deception? It all comes with the cost of being criticised all over again and being put down constantly and I don’t know if I can play the waiting game anymore. 

I can’t explain the way I see the world. I get overstimulated, overwhelmed by the amount of cars, the noise of it all. I just don’t like anything I see and take it all as a big troll/scam. I guess one day I woke up and wasn’t the same anymore. Come to think of it.. this happened once. I woke up one time and was convinced I wasn’t real.. I don’t remember what the exact concept was, but I was convinced I was a robot. I was totally freaked out.

Ultimately, I do want to get away from everything. I don’t want to be trapped in a room all day. I just can’t do it. And then I can’t sleep at night.. cos I think about all these things. I just don’t think there’s any way of making it without dealing with an unnecessary amount of stupidity. And I do have to throw this in here but how will I ever find love in this place? It’s just not going to happen and I’m smarter than that. Sometimes you just know what will happen in every situation and I rather save my energy honestly, get away from the brainwashing, cos at the end of the day, it’s a pointless fight."

Sadboijxghk,2021-11-06 15:40:51+00:00,I can’t decide whether to lull myself or not,"I want to die. I want to kill myself, but there is a slight possibility things might get better in the near future. You see, I failed out of college (for the second time) and want to find a job that I can tolerate but I’m having trouble with it. Plus, I’m so tired of trying all these different pills, being given advice I find ineffective, and being surrounded by people I don’t understand. But, I have gotten a few interviews so maybe I’ll get a job….but probably not. And then there’s my sister, she’d be really sad if I killer myself. But, sad things sometimes need to happen for the greater good. I’m disappointed with the thought of having to face my family at Thanksgiving and then Christmas, trying to explain my utter failure with as much dignity as I can muster. So ideally I’d like to die before Thanksgiving or Christmas. I don’t know. I really can’t decide. I’ll know when the time is right. If anyone comments, most if not all people will encourage me not too. But I don’t know. I wish the choice was easier."
thegeekygirl_20,2021-11-06 14:57:12+00:00,Im A Lonely and Boring Person,"I feel like I am a very lonley and boring person. Sure I talk to a lot of people be it online or irl but I dont have anyone who is a true close friend. I know this an awful thing to say but I find myself becoming envious of my siblings because they have good friends that they can talk to and spend time with, while me on the other hand find myself on my days off from work just sitting in the house trying to pass the time. I wish I had plans and I wish my life is more exciting but its not. For wxample I was talking to one friend and he has exciting news and it was interesting and I felt so embarrased that I had nothing just the same old boring shit.

Ive also been single (and sexless) for almost 3 years now and as much I want to start dating and find a real connection with someone I feel like they will get bored of me and run away because I dont have interesting hobbies or surrounded by good friends, and it would be unfair on them if they are the only person I spend time with, they would find me suffocating. 

Im scared that my early 20's are going to be wasted and I will have nothing to look back on when Im in  my senior years. Im frightened of being alone.

TLDR: Im lonely and boring and dont know what to do."
dark_elftress,2021-11-06 13:52:08+00:00,It’s life ya know?,I (21 F) have had a rough time with life and I don’t think it will be getting any easier. From childhood abuse from 7 till now actually. I feel like everyone wants to get rid of me. My dad barely sees me due to his wife who lost her leg due to her weight but still found ways to cheat on him. My brother who is a small town republican tries to give me life lessons when he’s younger than me and we end up fighting a lot. My family who isn’t close to where I am barely checks in on me. My in laws hate me understandably but I have tried my hardest to be on their good side. And I feel like my relationship is falling apart because I’m not doing enough. I’m in and out of my doctors trying to find the right meds and was sent to psychiatric care as well as a psychologist who I see for the first time Wednesday. This whole week until the weekend I’m working and if I’m not working I’m going to appointments. But my boyfriend (I will call him that now since he wants to start breaking things off if I don’t change) wants me to try to get our apartment clean and that it shouldn’t only been him. Yesterday was my only day off and I slept most of it because I haven’t gotten any sleep this past week. And if I don’t start doing things that we need to go our separate ways. Even though I feel that I have been cleaning up more than him for at least the past two months. Our apartment is a mess I will admit that and it’s purely out of laziness and (as he puts it “cause I use it like a crutch”) depression. Our last argument got so bad I drank 750ml of pink Whitney on an empty stomach cleaned up our bedroom and took a shower and shaved my pits (this is where I started to feel increasingly more drunk) to which he wanted to call my dad and break things off. Now he holds over my head that he makes 25$ an hour and I make 11$ which my paycheck doesn’t cover rent by myself. So I barely get anything from my paychecks because I get about 350$ per paycheck which is every other week. And last night that we had a talk that if things don’t start changing with me he’s willing to break it off because some post he read on Reddit that hard working females are taking care of their boyfriends as he is with me and they dropped the relationship because it was easier on them so he’s on the verge of doing that to me. And I know what you’re thinking “well just help clean more” and again I am just not enough for him. I feel like I’m questioning myself daily if life is really all worth the pain and bullshit because I’m starting to think it’s not. And my sleep has gotten so bad I sleep around 5 hours and take a nap after work but I’ve been getting less and less sleep and it doesn’t matter how many melatonin I take it doesn’t work. I just feel like giving up. Between the psychiatrist and psychologist to the physical therapy and the maybe plastic surgeon (breast reduction) and working as much as I can so we can pay bills and pay back loans it’s not worth it anymore. Cause I’m “too fat” during lockdown I gained a lot of weight to where my highest point was 387 and now that I’m working my ass off I’m down to 275 area it’s not the best weight but to lose 100 pounds in 3 months and maintain that weight for 3 months while on different meds every month is pretty much a shocker. But it’s not enough. I have to get back to at least 200 to be attractive again. I can’t look in the mirror due to body dysmorphia and I feel skinnier than what I look which kills me. I know this post is everywhere. I woke up an hour ago with only 2 and a half hours of sleep.
ashlyrind7,2021-11-06 13:29:44+00:00,"A soldier, a child, a doctor","Soldier comes back from the war
8 year old girl is abused by her father
Doctor who has seen too much in a starts to fall;.

Suddenly the three are together holding hands in a circle; in the middle of field. Looking at each other in confusion.  

The Soldier hears a loud bang and ducks. The little girl sees a man staring and gesturing for her to come over. The Doctor sees an ambulance with the man on the stretcher praying to his mother. With the hands still intact the Soldier whispers ""i think this is test"". But The little girl only sees the man come close and she is trying to scream. The Doctor stands still in fear that if she looks up. but she does. She sees the boy she couldnt save. Suddenlg The Doctor yells WE CAN DO THIS. The little girls snAps out of it and the Soldier nodded. 

Quickly a storm appeares with thunder and lightining  ""fear does not control us"". Said the Soldier. As they stood in the field with the storm swirling around them. In the wiind The Soldier saw friends who had passed. They waved and yelled ""we will always be brothers!"" The Doctor saw the boy in the storm. He yelled ""dont worry about me, others need your help"".  The child screamed at the man ""you don't own me"". The man was taken up with the wind and blown away.

 The storm stopped

All three turned to look at each other. The Soldier said ""did we do that? Did we make it stop?"" The Doctor replied in subtle suprise, ""i think we did."" Then she smiled,  ""You know, i think we are gonna be ok."" The child said ""it usually never stops. But maybe you guys helped.""

The three seperated, walking away through the field in the calm air.
 
""I think fear plays different roles on all of us. It is like it comes suddenly, like a storm can. And in that moment we feel like we have to make a immdiate decision. But if we are in a safe place, it can be hard to talk down that fear. Maybe it's that we have seen things, survived things, been abused or terrorized; and that fear is hard to explain to others. We dont all rise to be super heroes. Some if us are just taking it breath by breath.""

Kody_302,2021-11-06 11:23:23+00:00,How do I (32 M) get used to being alone again?,"My girlfriend (39 F) broke up with me abruptly about 2 1/2 months ago. She was my first everything. We used to work at the same place. 

So I seen her almost everyday. And if not I would always message her to check on her. I also meet her kids (19 M &amp; 8 M). I got attached to the youngest one. See her was the highlight of my my day. And being with them was the best thing about me week.

The times before them I was lonely at time. But now I just have a void. I realize at the time and definitely now. I was just working and going thought the day/s. Waiting to get to see and spend time with them.

The things that I used to find fun and entertaining. Just aren’t anymore. I just now stay in my head and we thing everything. I already work a lot about 80 hours a week.

 I messed up. And it never going to talk to me again."

Apprehensive-Sound42,2021-11-06 08:50:42+00:00,Even typing this is exhausting (tl;dr skip to last paragraph),"I've had depression most of my life. Been taking meds and seeing a Therapist for 25-30 years(altho I stopped seeing my therapist a few years ago and was on the hunt for another but doing OK in the interim). My depression has had it's ups and downs. I thought I was making some real headway but then Covid-19 came. Then in June 2020 I got diagnosed with Breast Cancer. After a double mastectomy, 8 rounds of chemo and 25 rounds of radiation I was ready to be on the road to recovery but they found more stuff so I have to have more surgery next weekend. On top of that I've had to move apartments so I'm living out of boxes right now.
So I'm too depressed to unpack, clean, meet/talk with friends or take a shower let alone get myself out of bed. My poor dog peed the bed last night because I was too tired/sleepy to wake up to take her potty. So now the whole bedroom smells like pee and we're both still just sleeping in the bed on top of towels. I know I need another therapist and I need meds for my sleep disorder but how do you do these things when you're too tired to even take your poor precious whining dog to pee. How do you get meds to fix/help your sleep disorder when narcotics are not allowed to be delivered?
Mostly I'm just venting. I've reached out to family who I hope 🤞🏽 can help because I don't know if I can take it anymore. I think I'm just exhausted of fighting to get better, of this endless pandemic which hits immune compromised people harder and of being this depressed as each day slips by with nothing to show for myself not even a shower (who does that!)
I'm lonely. I see my friends, family, peers moving on with their lives and I can't even brush my teeth. I see people bike riding, meeting up with each other, cooking, traveling, doing all the things that make life worth living and I can answer the nurses Covid-19 questions with No haven't been around anyone with Covid-19 because besides going to the hospital I never leave me house/bed. I want someone to shock me outta of my current state and into a normal person's routine/life. Overall I don't think I'm a bad person (looks, intelligence, social skills and EQ wise), I'm just so tired from depression, sleep disorder (Hypersomnia ie like Narcolepsy) and meds that what I'm doing doesn't resemble life. It is the very bare minimum of existing. Anyone else relate to any of this?"
blank_novels,2021-11-06 06:59:18+00:00,vent,"I haven't been eating well since last month, since the beginning of this month I entirely stopped I can feel I lost a lot of weight I had a bmi of 14.5 which was already a bit underweight now i feel I have lost even more weight. I am scared to look at myself or meet my family or just anyone. I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up."
nyx_moonlight_,2021-11-06 06:42:47+00:00,Feeling so sad tonight,"I recently hit a grim milestone. I am the highest weight I have ever been, 390lbs. I lost 30 lbs and kept it off through my first pregnancy and her birth back in April... then I began working from home in December. 60lbs gained in a heartbeat from enjoying all the junk I denied myself while pregnant. Then another 30. 

I have been single and on my own with my daughter from the beginning. Dating was hard 100 lbs ago. 200 lbs ago. It is hell at this weight. It is torture with the pandemic factored in. I have always had a really tough time with being fetishized and manipulated for sex. I had trouble saying no until my pregnancy. That was my wake-up call. I am so tired of being only seen for my body. And its not that I don't get the opportunities or attention its just that I am always expected to be ""easy"" in more ways than one. Tolerant of anything and everything. Endlessly patient and kind and grateful. I know this because when I assert boundaries or voice certain standards and opinions, I am left in the dust. 

I am just....so tired. Exhausted from single parenthood and work and housework. Exhausted deep in my soul. I love my daughter and would do anything for her. I knew keeping her meant I would make a hard situation (trying to change being single) monumentally harder. But I didn't realize just how hard it would really be. 

I have nights like tonight where I just cry and cry and cry feeling so alone. Scared it will always be like this. Scared I will always be on my own. (For further context, I am 31 and have not had a serious, legit relationship in 9 years). Scared I will have to explain my tears to my daughter someday. That she will have to learn the world of men. That woman are often discards when they don't fit certain proportions, check certain boxes. 

I see my traits and my very life mocked on reddit constantly. Single mothers. Women with weight and mental health issues. Women with blue hair lol. Women who care about social justice and are thusly the dreaded ""SJWs"". Sometimes it feels like all men just hate me. My stepfather and biological father (Mom too) were abusive. We are not close to either of those men for our safety. 

I feel undateable. I feel lost. My heart aches to not just be loved but to give love. To know someone deeply. To be apart of their world and their life. To be important. 

And guys please don't just tell me to go to therapy. I have seen child psychologists, therapists, neuropsychologists, counselors since I was 12. My parents were convinced my depression was my own creation and not a result of their neglect, abuse and violence between each other. 

I tried virtual therapy and just got absolutely nothing out of it. I have tried to go back anyway and they aren't accepting new patients. 

Just hoping someone else can relate and tell me it gets better, maybe? Idk."
hornybigcok,2021-11-06 05:57:20+00:00,Need help with relationship,"(context) I have been depressed for 5 years in a row while dating my ex. I tried suicide 3 times before and noped out at last moment. The relationship wasn't pretty and very 1 sided and abusive, I been told that I am not enugh and what not, basically destroying my self esteem. It took me a long time to realise that I wasn't the one abusing but I was the one who was abused coz my ex always said how awful I am and that I abused her and so on. In last few months of our miserable relationship she tried to over dose on meds and she was rushed to a hospital and she stayed there for about 3 days if I remember correctly (I can't remember things exactly coz it all happened few years ago). When I found out she was in a hospital I got there ASAP and (this is one of the important parts) and I got there and she was on the bed looking at me and started crying, that moment stuck with me very well and I remember it clear as day. I spend as much time I could with her and so on. A month later we went to a party and to keep things short drunk me I tried to cheat (yes ik I hate myself for that) and nothing happened but I did get accused of raping someone (faulsly). She didnt listen to me while I tried to explain my side of the story but that's fair enough, that isn't the point of this part. The point is that my life has absolutely crumbled from their on, no friends, absolute out cast and so on, I had absolutely nothing left. Then I joined army cadets for a year and focused on that and basically improved myself by doing the most boring tasks there and so on (basically mental self harm). I now more or less recovered I still feel shit and depressed here and there if that makes sense? But I problem is that I got into a new  relationship two years ago and we love each other and all and everything is perfect t bla bla bla but my issue is that i still feel like I am not just enough, that I will fuck everything up, that I don't deserve her and that she could do so much better than me. And we have talked about all of this and she made sure that ik that she loves me and now, but I still feel like shit, can anyone help? (sorry English not my first language and am doing this from phone)"
Holiday_Wench,2021-11-06 03:27:05+00:00,Spinnning in my head,"So I'm a 16 year old in juinor high. My Grandmother just recently passed and i just thought i would vent.

I've had mental illness since 7th grade. Maybe even before because my father who is blind has bipolar, which given both, he can barely be a dad for me. I have a dad but he doesn't do dad things.

My mother is always too busy to really spend time on anything. Gone most of the day and having to carry my dad me and other people in her life. She drinks and smokes a lot but reacts ok to substances. Same for my dad.

I do online since i buckle under public school. Its ok but i miss my peers sometimes. I think i have ADHD but thats undiagnosed. Seems i focus on anything except what i need to. Its hard to deal with social issues,mental issues, and school. 

I'm always a shoulder to lean on but barely have shoulders to lean on. It makes me frustrated that I'm always having to round house through life alone. 

So its given I'm lonely as fuck. It feels worst because i had a taste of what liking someone feels like. I felt soo happy but i wasn't together with myself and had no experience. Ever since i crave a partner. To deal with this loneliness i watch pornography. 

My grandpa was a wise person. He was a gun enthusiasts and worked 20 jobs, all manual labor. He survived polio and some other sickness. He was very interested in litature and opened my eyes to the spaces outside of the lines in life and helped me through existential crisis.

My grandmother who died was a tough woman. Though on thousands of meds after her transplant in 2014, she seemed to have a plate of body issues. Visiting her was how i cleared my head, a santuary in Glen Harbor, Michigan. The only person that made me feel good about myself. Sweetest woman ever.

So recently on my dads side i might see my Nana (thats what we call her) die to cancer due to incompitent medical staff. Heavy breast canncer too but a tumor the size of a basketball in her stomach. Doctor had 4 months to remove it and never did. Then it grew !

I'm insecure mostly about my dad bod. Its hard to exercise when you live in a small house 1 hour away from a gym in a pact city. Oh yea its also mostly winter seasons here. I'm a big body in general but i could be thinner. Idk how i survived gym and body mechanics (gym but harder).

Idk what goals i have in life really. Just trying to graduate really, so many career options idk what to do. I just want to secure a decent living. Kids in the future if i can afford it. Which speaking of affording shit. How the fuck do i get hired in the state of Americas economy. It really looks like shit is gonna nose dive 2030 and i want to get out to canada if i can. I also thought of learning the ways of the prepper. 

Instead of the adults guiding me its me having to guide adults and others. I have been left with a dying world to clean up. Irresponsible leaders making it hell for me. Congrats your driving us into the ground. 

I hope i never live to see the Atom Bomb go off. Or the next world war. Or when climate change bites our ass. Which too late. Its starting ! Slowly...

Sorry to give you my life story. I know i don't have it the worst but it pains me to see innocents suffer and i can barely make a dent. I'm 16 and confused. I only haven't killed myself because of family. 

Thanks for reading. I only hope the best for you."
guygoingthroughlife,2021-11-06 03:22:48+00:00,I’m starting to hate my own mother.,"I’m 21, Male. I live alone with my mum but recently it’s really having some negative impacts on me. She isn’t a bad mother. I just can’t stand being around her anymore. I don’t want to sound ungrateful to those who don’t have their mother/father with them today (my condolences) but I can’t pretend I don’t feel the way I do. My mother likes to talk and is really old-school. Sometimes I’ll see her making efforts for conversation but I’m just not wanting to speak to her anymore/at times. I have nothing to say. Everyday just repeats itself for me. My mother does more than me as she sure likes to tell me how I should be doing more. My mother likes to talk - is real affectionate and understanding a real ‘old school’ type of mum but something in me just can’t bare it anymore. She’s incredibly lonely too and sometimes I feel immense guilt if I don’t speak to her or spend time with her. I’m just not in the right mental space for that - it’s sometimes draining for me to even just keep up with simple conversation. I can’t tell her I’m not okay cause then she’ll try to talk to me about it. She always reminding me about - what we ‘used to do’ and how ‘we used to talk’. Even on the days I do have a longer than usual conversation with her - she’ll say ‘that was a nice talk, thank you’ or bring it up the following day, week after as if it’s so rare - the way she praises these feeble conversations makes me wonder if I’m just a terrible son - when I’m watching shows with her or have any sort of engagement with her - she’ll mention how when I was younger how often we would do stuff ‘like this’ or how ‘energetic’ or ‘bubbly’ I was - as if all those features have been sucked away from me. I live in an apartment so I can’t exactly avoid her - she’s often in the living/sitting room (which is before the kitchen) sometimes I’d avoid going to the kitchen for hours or until she sleeps (which is near impossible as she sleeps around 2-3am EVERYDAY) if I need water or food I would literally starve until I’ve heard her go into her room to sleep or leave briefly - it’s getting to the point I would skip breakfast in the mornings as I just want to skip the ‘good mornings’.  I know how wrong I sound. People have had horrible parents. Abusive parents etc and would deem someone like me ungrateful. I know if she suddenly passed I would wish I never felt this way but don’t want that to happen - just for me to realise that. Everyday I wake up and say ‘how am I going to act normal for mum’. I don’t want to wake up feeling guilty - that I’m not doing enough as a son. I don’t want to have to be there every-time i feel she’s alone just because I’m there - it’s a terrible feeling. I can’t have a day in without her thinking it’s a mental health issue and whether I want to ‘talk’ about it. Majority of my family are females I love them all but my mother is extremely emotional, sensitive - it’s starting to rub off on me. if she robbed a pen from a store she would come home telling me about it like it’s a heist. Don’t ask about my father. Sadly all the boys in my family are on his side and I have no connections to him and I haven’t seen that side of the family in so long it’s awkward. 
Am I in the wrong? I can see why but try to understand where I’m coming from. I’ve missed a lot of details that are probably crucial to understanding in depth about myself and my mother but can anyone share some advice?"
Tito_III,2021-11-06 02:32:14+00:00,I feel alone," I feel like I’m becoming depressed or maybe more so, I don’t know to be honest. I have always felt lonely and that I didn’t have anyone to talk to or actually be true to. I have never truly felt like I had someone to speak to until I had my first gf when I was 18 ( now 22) after high school. I told her how I actually felt and the things that I have experienced in my life and how they affected me. But I also was never able to truly express myself because I have never learned to do so, I always kept my thoughts to myself. I don’t want to be a burden to her because she had her own issues and problems. But I still felt like I finally had someone that I could talk to and I loved her… but she treated me like shit. She cheated and lied and manipulated me but I still loved her. Three years passed and she broke up with me and left me for someone else. I felt alone again for months and I cried and felt depressed but I had to smile and pretend like nothing happen to my family and say we just broke up. It’s been two years and I haven’t really felt alone, maybe because I was focused on college and graduating. But now I’m done with college and now I’m starting to think more and feel alone again and I’m getting worse every week. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I don’t want to end myself but I don’t want to feel this way and I don’t want to get worse."
SpeckiSS,2021-11-06 00:49:24+00:00,Could use some advice from people with experience in the following topic.,"Hey,

first of: I am a young 18 y/o guy, with a diagnosed major depression. I was told it's basically the worst, but could be even more worse, and now to my definitely over though ""problem/ hopeless feeling situation"":

Important to know at first is that I've been in a psychiatry for 9 days, since I overdosed on pills unintentionally, but didn't care if I'd die in the situation. 

I am addicted to stimulants like amphetamines and yesterday I sadly relapsed due to emotional distresse and strong craving. 


Now I am aware that I need more help than only being at a psychiatry for 9 days, but since my ASD, which was diagnosed in my stay, I am extremely sensitive to changes. Moving out of my surroundings again is just too much for me (May sound weird, I apologize. It's difficult to describe for me). 

I am not in any therapy right now, since one therapist kinda declined to treat me due to ""Too big of a responsibility"". My psychiatrist just went in pension and, yeah. I am here with huge struggles, one single friend in real life, which is avoiding me and spends time with other people. 

And now my big question: Should I take my deepest courage and go into stationary therapy, far away in a place where I don't know anything? The senior physician even offered a slot in the Withdrawal station with lots of therapy."

Leonnardoox,2021-11-05 23:36:49+00:00,My boyfriend cheated on me.,"My boyfriend cheated on me. I learned about this incident yesterday. Although he said he loved me very much, he was in a relationship with another girl. Let's get back to drugs."
_Chairo_,2021-11-05 22:09:08+00:00,feeling like my depression is just exaggeration,"I used to be really lonely and upset during a lot of my childhood, but I don't think it was the worst. I was called names, and told things like ""no one will ever love you"" and ""you've got no friends, they're all fake"" and ""you're fat/ugly/weird/idiotic/etc"" and things like that. I also got shouted at a lot, most of the time with no reason. Also slight family issues and things. Trauma also.

However, now a few years later I have made friends, and they're the most wonderful people you'll ever meet. And I have great things in life.

I just don't know, my brain always thinks i'm exaggerating everything. I feel like I should be happy. Apart from being told things, and some trauma, i've had a relatively good life. I feel stupid for being a depressed piece of s**t and not wanting to exist sometimes. I live in an okay household. I have friends. Pets. Good things in my life I should be happy to have.

Even with good and positive things, I feel depressed. Sometimes i'm just tired of existing and having to control this stupid body. There's bad days I can barely leave my bed, but in the end I always seem to make it out some way I guess. 

I just feel bad that I feel bad. I should enjoy things. I should feel happy because of the good things :(

I don't know why i'm like this

I don't know if this is seasonal or if it comes and goes, but it's such an awful feeling and state of mind. 

This post is a mess, but at least I find it comforting that i'm not alone and there's communities like this.

I can't get myself to seek proper help though, and I suck at opening up to people.

Thank you for reading."
ilovemydog6565,2021-11-05 18:22:31+00:00,Feeling hopeless,"Hello, i made this account because I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. 
My whole life I’ve wanted to be a doctor but I have ADHD and school has always been extremely difficult for me. Well I went to college and I chose to major in neuroscience as a pre med. I have worked my ass off. I’m still in school but ive had to take an extra year and a half. Ive been struggling with severe depression for the past few years and it’s made everything feel impossible. 
The first two years were really rough, I had a boyfriend of two years and he cheated on me and it really put me in a bad place. Two weeks after that somebody close to me committed suicide. The following year my dad got very sick. it was very overwhelming to work full time, deal with car problems, my dads health, school all while being depressed. (My dad is ok now but at the time it was terrifying) I became so sad and hopeless. I lost all my friends. I still went to work full time and tried my best in school though. My mom has a drinking problem and we aren’t very close too and that’s always bothered me. I was so sad I would sit in my car after work for hours and cry.
A year later I met my current boyfriend, he’s great and I love him so much. We’ve been together 2 years now. He’s going away to med school next year and I’m so happy for him but he’s the only person I’m close to and it’s killing me that I might lose that. I keep this to myself because I need to be happy for him.
I finally reached out and got help for my depression and I got a little better for a while and I was put on medication for adhd/ depression. This was really hard to do because asking for help has always scared me. I got a therapist and I actually opened up to her after a few months. Unfortunately she is leaving in a couple of months and I have to find someone else. My grades improved significantly after medication but  now I’m in almost my last year of college and I’m going to graduate with a 3.27 cumulative gpa and a 3.15 science gpa. My stats are way too low for medical school. I feel so defeated and depressed. I even took extra time to do school and I still wast enough. I’ve always been treated like I’m dumb and I just wanted so badly to prove I wasn’t, and I failed. It just feels horrible knowing how hard I tried and seeing everyone else succeed without you.
I apologize if I sound like I feel sorry for myself, I just don’t know what to do anymore and I feel like I have nothing to live for. I guess I just needed to get it off my chest. 
Please be nice."

blobb27,2021-11-05 07:35:50+00:00,Sex,"I’m married with two kids. I need sex and my wife knows I desire sex. My drive is much higher than hers. We have sex together maybe once a month. I’m wide awake right now wishing we could share that moment together, hurting inside. We have talked many times. Sharing this with the internet won’t fix this problem I feel because the only person who can is sleeping next to me. How to get her to understand, I don’t know. I don’t want her to just “put out” for me because meaningless sex isn’t something I want. Her desire to have sex just isn’t apart of who she is. She could probably go without sex all together if she could. We have had these talks many times, she is fully aware of what I want. I work hard at my job which requires me to travel and all of her financial needs are met. When I come home, in which I am away 3 days at a time, all I want to do is spend time with the family and eventually, hopefully, have a chance of having sex with her. Sex usually doesn’t happen and i’m so sexually frustrated. My mind is filled with the desire to go out and cheat. I personally would never do that because I appreciate my life in which I worked so hard to help build. I care about my family deeply but I want to take care of myself as well. I want that connection so badly with my wife. Talking to her about this is only beating a dead horse at this point. Why am I writing this? I don’t know, attention? I want somebody over the internet to feel bad for me? I feel bad for myself? Regardless, I don’t know what i’m trying to achieve by posting this but appreciate you reading this and whatever feedback."

goldensunstate,2021-11-05 06:19:19+00:00,Living is exhausting!,I don’t know if I can explain this accurately but I wonder if anyone else finally gets a routine you can uphold but after a little bit of time you start losing the pieces to the routine. This trend continues until you find it difficult to get out of bed and brush your teeth. Is this part of depression? That even tasks once able to be completed seem impossible now?

yeah of course i have and had my struggles but i was doing way better before you came into my life.. “you are kind of the reason” why I’m not doing so well.. with all your gaslighting, lies and manipulation.. doing so much for you yet it’s never enough.. stuck in that toxic box is tuff but eventually you gotta break out of it but even when you do the damage has already been done so it’s still a constant battle almost like a wound that never closes.. of course there’s good days but the bad overwhelms the good which makes it hard to see the sun beyond the clouds.. how do you not become that person who hurt you ? how do you not let it hurt you and break you even after it’s over.. ? how do you trust again if all your loved ones have broken it.. how do you give the good people a chance if half of them are disguised as good to hide the bad just to go through the same thing again.. how do you not look like the victim or victimize yourself even though what they did to you made you the victim and how do you stop attracting the same kind of people who don’t listen to you when you speak up about the hurt and just flip things on you making you feel wrong for telling them how you feel instead of just taking responsibility for their actions.. ?.. am i wrong for telling you how you made me feel when you hurt me ? did i say it wrong or at the wrong moment in time ? or is the problem really you but you’ve convinced me it’s me because you’re so broken, lost and hurt yourself that you can’t even see or don’t want to see what it is that you are doing.. I’m tired of them bagging on me like I’m some piece of shit when i know deep down I’ve done what i can to show you I’m real that i love you and that i am there.. when I’ve proved my love and value which costs me my happiness and caused me hurt, damage.. brokenness…. I’ve lost myself but I’ve found myself but then I’ve lost myself again in other things because I’ve lost myself in toxic relationships.. I’ve found myself again but at this point I’m just here.. so numb and broken that I’m just here.. with no feelings or attachments towards anyone or others I’m just here.. my mental and emotional apparently aren’t here though.. what do you do ?
will i ever feel “normal” again or am i just “here” for the rest of my life.. the kind of exhaustion that sleep can’t fix.."

I don’t want to kill myself, I just don’t want to be exist anymore.

I know I‘m young and have a whole life ahead of me and blah blah blah.

But I just don’t care, I don’t care that ”things are going to get better”.

I don’t care, I don’t care.

Nothing matters. If someone were to take my life right now, I wouldn’t even mind.

No matter what I do I just can’t shake this feeling of sadness of, I always want to start crying. But most of the times I can’t even get a tear out. 

Anddddddd no one knows it, literally no. one. Everyone thinks they know me but they don’t. I don’t even know myself. Everyone always talks about their feelings to me and I don’t mind it. I absolutely love helping people, it’s my love language. But sometimes I hear stuff that just makes me feel so bad about my feelings. Like my feelings aren’t valid, because other people have it so so much worse then me."

Prehistoric_Lama,2021-11-04 20:41:26+00:00,"Pain, absolute pain.","Long story ahead.


All my life I’ve been like some kind of outcast, never had real friends, feeling so misunderstood, I’ve always been known as the dude who either walks alone or hangs out with multiple groups of people who don’t even notice him, it’s like I’m there but not really, like a shadow, no one ever at least tried to understand me and get to know who I exactly am, and from a sentimental perspective, I never had gf, it’s as dry as you could imagine, I’ve understood a long time ago that it would be a massive waste of time for me, because I would try finding something that I’ll never have, so I gave up a long time ago.

Last year, in college, I came face to face with a girl I had a huge crush on back when we were in high school, unfortunately, we didn’t go to the same school so I didn’t know her before college, but, as I said, I gave up, without even trying, because I knew that no matter how hard I tried, it would never work, so I didn’t talk to her at all, expecting to forget her like I usually did with every single woman I’ve had a crush on, but, what happened next absolutely broke me emotionally, and to this day I’m still broken. 

I noticed that she would always sit right before or after me, she would blush and avoid looking me in the eyes when I was walking and stood just next to her, she also would stare at me for long periods of time, but I didn’t care, until one day, out of nowhere, she turns around to talk to me, saying that she knows me, and that she noticed me back when we we’re still in high school, and to my great surprise, even told me my name even though I never told her what my name was, after some time, she frequently started talking to me in college and tried to make me laugh, which after quite a long time, made me fall for her, I tried reasoning myself but it wasn’t enough, we started talking through text too, she always would send the first message, and we would find ourselves texting for extended periods of time until late in the night, she flirted with me on multiple occasions, mentioning that she would like to move in with me to help me out in my life, saying that I was more than a friend to her, one time I was kinda down and told her about how I feel like when I see myself in a mirror and not being able to see anything else but an ugly, unattractive and boring person, to which she replied that I was deeply wrong and to never tell that to myself ever again, one time she got noticeably jealous when I talked about another woman who I thought was cute and funny, she also noticed whenever I was down and would send me a text each time to check if I was good, she really did make me feel great and for once in my life, liked by another human being, so I decided to confess my feelings to her, but she didn’t give me a clear answer, she even said to one of her friends that she was too busy with some personal stuff and that she needed time which is completely understandable.

After that event, I didn’t feel that sad as I told myself that even after rejecting me, I still had a great friend that I could count on, but she ghosted me for 2 weeks only to send a text like nothing happened, asking me about some random stuff she didn’t understand in college, and here it all changed, she became even more flirty and chatty, she would literally run when she saw me from a distance to catch up on me, she became funnier and more ongoing, she would grab my forehand tight when talking to me, sometimes laying on my side and holding on my arm tight, she ignored other people around us and almost exclusively talked to me only, I didn’t know how to feel anymore tbh, I loved her so much but at the same time was so confused.

And it all went wrong, she started asking me stuff about some people I knew, and insisted that I should get her into that group of people, which I did, and she literally ghosted me again after doing so, she started flirting with who was one of my closest friends, she became rude, disrespectful and avoidant, she had some harsh comments about me whenever I tried talking to her, so I distanced myself too, and after quite some time, I still feel immensely sad and hopeless and desperate, I’m all alone, I don’t even have the power to talk to people anymore, I avoid people now, I don’t even like her anymore but what she did to me really did scar my soul, and that’s a scar that I can never, ever heal from, I’ve always dealt with depression, but before this happened, I actually had started slowing getting out of it, but ultimately, after what happened, I’ve never felt so broken, even though it happened months ago, it comes back to haunt me every single day, I feel numb, hopeless, stupid, a husk of a man I used to be, I’m so disconnected from the outside world, like a spectator of my own fall."
Kody_302,2021-11-04 20:10:28+00:00,She (39 F) was to good for me (32 M).,"At the end of the day. She (39 F) was to good for me (32 M). She has friends, family, good paying job and her kids. And I didn’t give her the one thing the she need form me. 

Who wants to date a 32 year old virgin. That can’t satisfy you needs. That works 80-120 hours a week. For reasons I never got to tell you. Also I took to long to sort stuff out in his head. I waste 8 months of her life. That time she should of spend with other people and family. 

In hindsight I should have never meet her kids. And the fact that I will never get to see them again. Hurt more then I can put in to words. But I want to thank for letting him being part life for the time that we had."

I'm barely holding it in as it is. I hate who I am, and I don't want to be myself anymore. I've started writing my thoughts down on a notebook. They're not pretty. I've also had to cancel counseling appointments multiple times because schoolwork's been piling up. It feels like everything's just going wrong.


 I don't know why exactly it's so hard for me to talk to people. It just is. I'm not good enough to do anything worthwhile and I don't think I'll ever be as happy as the people I see around me. It's been really hard for me to maintain any kind of friendship and I don't see myself having anything romantic at any point."

Treatment has sub par effect on me at best. having to live with this life long condition makes me suffer and struggle everyday. All my connections wont last anyway. I might as well keep to myself forever. my mental health ruins it automatically."

Legi_life_158,2021-11-04 00:46:19+00:00,Lies of life,"Today I was told of the betrayal of a group of friends I have, I felt my heart break, my world crumbling to pieces. These friends helped me find the light in the world when I was about to crumble under the helplessness I felt about life. I feel used and worthless like I was stepped like useless trash, that my love was trampled like dirt. I used to believe that I was worthless, that I had no real meaning to life...I only took up space and air that could be for someone who actually wished to live. That I was an ungrateful person for not enjoying the life I was given, then I stopped caring what others said, it was my life after all...fuck everyone else. I felt that I could breath again, have the self esteem to live and make happy not only myself but those around me. It was my fault for not realizing that since we are human and many of us fall in to depravity of hurting and torturing others that I should question if such friendship could be true. Built in lies, I wonder how far their ugliness would continue, probably until they had me in their grasp to torture my body and soul, to literally cut me to pieces for their sick depravity that they allowed themselves to fall in...and when I came vulnerable they would use me to build me up so they themselves could tear me to pieces. Such naivety from my part to believe in the goodness of people...i told my mother that if we're to die someday too soon it wouldn't because of others using me in their sick games of torture, prostitución or human slavery, I rather end my life and meet my dead relatives maybe I'd regret ending my life, that I didn't fight like those fighters who fight and escape the depravity of others. But at least I would meet them sooner, maybe in the after life I will finally be able to understand that love our creator has for us. To be able to forgive others for they are blinded by the darkness. I ran up the stairs to the rooftop I thought of ways I would jump, but then I remembered that the moment in which I am at is where my death would not only take me but take others for they are my family who love me. I am so sad and disappointed, not just in myself but with humans in general, humans who torture and use others.... Really I should disappear so I dont someday become so hateful and sick of everyone."

dmtoadd,2021-11-03 11:26:19+00:00,Anybody relates? How do you cope?,"So, I was diagnosed with depression around two years ago, though treatment that i got didn't really help and I'm wondering that maybe there is some other disorder hiding behind or people with severe MDD have the same experience.

My depression can be described as being extremely detached from the body. I have derealization/depersonalization feeling every day at some point, i don't have a strong sense of self identity and it seems like my body and the real world are somewhere else. It feels like my subconsciousness is a separate persona observing everything I do or think as a human. It spots the irrational thinking, all the distractions my mind is trying to find and attempts to stop it. 

I have traumatic event that happened to me as well that caused anxiety. I'm socially anxious, struggling to feel attached even to people that are close to me. I have insomnia and problems with concentration due to the fact that i can't stop thinking. I had a period of time of substance abuse and reckless behavior which was connected to suicidal tendencies. And when I get worse mentally I start having obsessive thoughts on how to come back to drugs or some relationships I actually don't feel like I need though I still get involved cause they make me think less. 

One day i feel like I found some sort of purpose based on self development, progress and understanding the reality. It makes me feel better for a while before my mind destroys this concept and brings me back to Earth.


I stopped going to my psychiatrist or taking antidepressants besides Trazodone. I'm thinking of getting therapy this time cause I'm struggling a lot with having mental force to finish my last year of university.

Was wondering if any of you, who were diagnosed only with MDD had such a strong disconnection from oneself and reality and how did you cope with it? Cause it makes me incredibly unmotivated and empty."

I just need an actual friend these days. I (22)[m] recently ended my relationship with my gf(21) last month. It was mutual for the most part but we spent the last 5 years together so needless to say i had gotten very use to haveing her to talk to and travel with and enjoy movies and tv shows with and just plain use to her being there for me and being my best friend. I miss the hell outta her of course but sadly she is and always will be way to good for me and for everyone for that matter, so im doing my best to fake a smile throughout the day and trying like hell to get over the relationship and move on, however i have found myself shutting everyone out and just plain checking out of life in general. Not in the self pitty sort of way but in the sense that im just in a fog i can seem to find my way though. I swear i am trying tho... I am by far not interested or ready to start dating or even looking but i would like to get back to being more social and meet and talk to new people so if you are down to try and vibe add me on Snapchat: Tidwell0010 hope everyone reading this has a better day tomorrow than they had today. ~Much love❤️"

xfallenangelx95,2021-11-03 07:00:18+00:00,"I want to find a friend - someone who wants to talk daily throughout the day.I feel like the only friendless and rejected person in the world.Everyone I think I get along with is always ""too busy""I want to talk to another loner who wants to feel important - someone talkative who needs a true friend","Please read (Everything )

Please don't send me a message if my post is ""too long to read"" for you or If you're another person willing to ""help"" despite being in a completely different situation.Don't send me a message If you're only into abbreviations and very short messages and please don't force yourself to send me a message only to please me.Stay true to yourself :) What matters is to feel comfortable.

I'm here because I would love to find someone to talk to.I don't have any true friends &amp; I want to change my situation.I don't really want to wait any longer than 5 or 6 hours just to receive a message that can be typed and send in a few seconds or minutes..I'm a human too and I hate excuses..I don't need another shallow friendship. I want to meet someone who wants to talk on a daily basis - why? I want to finally see someone's engagement..I want to talk to someone who also needs a friend to talk to throughout the day.I'm always the one waiting for people's messages and I'm sick of them never making any time for me. &amp; I don't feel understood by them.

Strong friendships are based on mutual support. One of the best things you can do for a friend in need, is just to be there for them when they want to talk.I often see posts from people who always say how friendless they are because they don't feel loved or appreciated by their ""friends"" remember! A true friend - someone who truly likes you or someone who wants to get to know you - will always find time for you. I have a lot of free time (I don't want anyone to send me a message only out of sympathy or boredom though - friendships shouldn't be forced) so..send me a message only If you want to talk often and If you're a talkative person) I'm not really interested in small talk/short messages - I love long and meaningful messages. It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like ""How are you?"" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.

I personally don't care about people's interests -common interests.What matters to me is your honesty,respect,your outlook on life.

I'd rather talk to someone in a similar situation.Someone friendless..Don't get me wrong - most people deserve to be happy and It's good to have friends but people who have friends in real life are usually more focused on them &amp; have less time for others.Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on.Sometimes I feel like the only friendless &amp; rejected person in the world.I love warm-hearted people.Sensitive people who always try to understand others.Empathy is everything

I want to meet someone who won't reject me &amp; my friendship

My boyfriend used to treat me like a princess to..leave me..&amp; now? I just need a friend..Nothing else

I'm not looking for any relationship.Just someone like me.. to cry together and laugh together and support each other.I can't bear the pain..I don't want to hear ""find a therapist"" or ""everything will be ok"" because life is unpredictable..I just want to find someone who can relate..someone in the same situation.Someone who will always be there (If we get along) I need it more than ever.I know how sad my post is but I'm also very sad.I can't believe someone I loved so much just left me.blaming me for everything..I just can't.Nothing hurts more than being super friendless.having no one who understands you..I really would rather talk to someone in exactly the same situation.I'm too sad to talk only about random stuff or hear positive stories from other people.I want to talk to another person willing to listen to me.Another person who doesn't have anyone just to support each other.Someone who would never tell me ""move on"" or ""stop complaining"" someone who needs someone to talk to almost all the time.I don't want to feel like the only sad person in the world or be rejected again.Most people say ""I don't have any friends.I would do anything for a friend"" but they never have time for others..Imagine never getting any messages from others..always waiting for someone to text you..waiting &amp; waiting..spending most of your time at home (not by choice) I really wish I had at least one person in my life.

One person who would make me feel important.If you really need someone to talk to due to loneliness and If you have time to talk to daily (throughout the day and even night)I always make time for others.I'm literally always available.I could even stay up all night long only to talk to someone...

I feel like only another person in EXACTLY the same situation..would truly understand me.Which is why I'm looking ""for a twin"" I literally don't have anyone and I want to desperately change my situation.I see people's happiness everywhere..On TV,In real,on the internet and newspapers &amp; I? I feel like my life is no longer worth living.I don't even take photos of myself because I don't have anyone to share them with.

I'm 26.. I would rather talk to someone from Europe.

18-35 age range.

Send me a private message If you want to talk.. only long messages.I never ignore them If they're interesting to me.

No abbreviations

Please don't criticize me &amp; don't give me unwanted advice.I'm already sad enough and all I want is to find a friend.

I want to talk on reddit first so don't ask me to talk on Discord or some other app.

If you want to talk to me tell me your story - tell me why you're on reddit,what kind of friend would you like to meet - something like that - instead of asking me ""what are your hobbies?"" or telling me what you're interested in. It doesn't matter to me If you like the same songs or movies as I do as long as you're honest,understanding,loyal and talkative - as long as you're a good person.I don't get along with people who are completely different than me which is why I would rather talk to someone with a very similar personality type.

If you want to talk to me - Please don't ignore everything I say in my private messages only to answer some questions - refer to each part of my messages"

Me and my ex and my friend were having a good time n shit like usual then my friend sends me snaps of saying ""hey I want your gf"" as a joke n shit and since I'm a very sensitive person and shit I yelled at him. After that I realized I fucked up but it was already too late for me. She didn't clearly say she wanted to break up with me but I could tell by her expression from her voice messages that she wanted to. I also have severe anger issues due to past trauma and other things. I'm not gonna try to get her back cause I already know it's over for me and she won't take my sorry ass back. I'm thinking of hanging myself to a little hook on my ceiling that was left there for construction purposes. To everyone I hurt that night (going to make up names) rose I'm so sorry that I did this and became the one person you did not want to see. And Derek I'm so sorry that I yelled at you over some stupid ass joke and that I can't be there and I ain't mad at you."

aurelie-beckers,2021-11-02 21:49:14+00:00,"Psychologist, help!","Hey,

I just turned 18 and was thinking to see the psychologist at my uni myself. Nobody knows anything about my situation but it's getting too bad to handle myself. They are free so it's the best option i have.

However, the thought of going scares me a lot. For example, under which circumstances are they allowed to inform your parents? Or when can they suggest you to go to a mental hospital? I heard that it's possible for them to ask you to see someone outside the university when it is too serious, but when would this be? Are they even 'made' to help people with depression/self harm and suicidal thoughts, not directly related to uni?

Has anyone experienced this and/or knows the answer to my questions?

Or can just tell me something about them and reassure me a little bit.. 
I want to call them tomorrow for an appointment. 

Thank you!"

Im bombarded with so much constantly that I just express anger or annoyance again which makes me feel worse about myself. Today I woke up with dread and I was unsure why but as my day went on It kind of hit me with everything at once. I even got the promotion Ive been working towards for a few months and when My boss told me I had to fake my excitement. I keep watching the clock as time widdles down so I can go home which is weird because most days now id rather not go to work or come home.

Flow_Scholar,2021-11-02 19:08:22+00:00,My birthday,"It's my birthday today, which in a weird way has just became a way of celebrating by virginity.

I'm 19 having never even touched a woman. What I dont think people understand is that yes being a virgin sucks and sex is probably quite a good feeling, what really hurts is never having validation, never having someone look In your eyes and have any sort of admiration for you, and to realise that it will be like this the rest of your earthly existence, that is what makes me depressed.

I could realistically pay for sex whenever I want, but it would be fake and make me more depressed as it would remind me i have to pay for a slither of what countless others enjoy multiple times throughout out their lifes.

Although both genders experience this differently, we share the same pain. Hope all who read this are doing okay : )"

I was treated like crap for being socially anxious by my teachers and my friends ,teased and mocked for being fat ,being around a lot of people frustrates the crap out of me and makes me awkward and clumsy ,there have several incidents where I have fallen and everyone around me starts to laugh at my face ,try being the subject of conversation for 4-5 hrs just because you missed a step ,wow ,reading this aloud makes me anxious .Porn is quite common around 15 year olds I suppose ,I was caught seeing it by my supposed friend and it spread like a wild fire and people started judging me as if I was some kind of creep and they were monks (these idiots introduced porn to me).I don't know if I am oversensitive or not ,but what are you supposed to do when people do mean things to you ,subject you to all kind of ridicule and say just for fun ?

People around think that they are in some way superior to me ,I have stopped giving any importance to them ,what I fear is that are all the people like this ?I plan to move to a foreign country (European country)
,I know they are not but ,come on ! Consider this scenario ,If I go over and try to start a conversation, being socially awkward and all ,won't I be seen as weird and get rejected ?

The only thing that has stopped me from going onto a downward spiral is Netflix and Mathematics .
Basically what I'm trying to say, I have been bullied and my culture is based on appearence and looks and since I am not a photo material I am treated like crap ,I am waiting to move to a foreign country ,my hope is that I won't be seen just as a fat guy ,but someone who is quite intelligent and likes to watch  police procedurals and who has your back even in tough situations ,people shouldn't be ashamed of being friends with me ,is that even possible ?

Thank you for reading !
Hope you have a nice day"

And its the reason I have not tried to get help again or reach out to those who care so I could have someone to talk to. The last time I saw a therapist I was about 19, had just dropped out of college, and I was in the worst shape (mentally) in my life. The only reason I managed to get into therapy was because I went to the doctor for my lack of sleep where they diagnosed me with insomnia and MDD and set me up with a therapist. Even then I didn’t know how to tell my mom. She didn’t even know I had been dealing with that because when she gave me the opportunity years before to open up and I told her that I am depressed, she just brushed it off and said “its just a phase.” Like, I already had a hard time opening up-that was just me having that difficulty. But then she just sealed the deal, now I know I have no support there. And its not like I could go to my dad because he’s just the macho “wtf are you even sad for” type of guy. After therapy I was better for a while but then I fell back into this shit again and I just don’t know how to ask for help. The thought of me telling my parents I want to get back into therapy is overwhelming. I don’t know how I would say it or how they would react. Then comes the sympathy and the “watch what you say around him” shit that I hate if I did that. I suffer alone because the people around me conditioned me to be this way and I hate it. I hate being this way. I miss being depressed and in college because then I feel like I had an excuse. Being depressed and working a job is shitty because I feel like I am making others feel like shit because I feel like shit or I feel like people expect me to have my shit together already."

Sure, I'll miss not finishing attack on titan, or demon slayer. I'll miss not playing the new remastered pokemon diamond and pearl. I'll miss the sweet taste of my favorite candy and ice cream.

We’ve lived here for around a year. Everything was going okay at first. 
Not too long after, my mom stopped working and income came to a halt. I was in college. I’ve postponed college, and now work, generally seven days/week. I pay my bills, and her bills. I don’t make enough to be anywhere near financially stable, and can’t move out on my own yet. Anyway, after my mother’s boyfriend found out she had quit her job, he started mentioning finances more. She is home all the time, and he works from home. Eventually it moved from finances, to anything and everything. They argue; quite often. Unfortunately my birth father and mother did this too, and I frankly do not want to live it again. This is mild compared to my previous home life, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it got worse. What I honestly just hate the most is that I feel all of it. I can feel the tension. I can tell if one of them is mad by the sound of their footsteps. I can feel when something bad is about to happen. 
And I hate it. It makes me feel unsafe, stressed, uncomfortable, etc. 
It’s stressing me out so bad. I’m miserable here more often than not. But I feel like I’ve thrown myself into this position by not being more financially stable. I would leave if I could. But I can’t, I have no other family here, no friends. I have a boyfriend, but he lives with his mom. 
I just feel like I have no where to go, and with depression and anxiety, it just feel like there’s only one option. I’m nineteen years old, and don’t want this to be the end. But damn, I hope I can get out of here soon and just finally be at ease."

I’m not against giving it a shot but I’m just disappointed at how therapy went. 
Can anyone here tell me their experience with anti depressants?"
LeahBlah,2021-11-01 23:53:24+00:00,I am numb.,"For the past several months I have slowly stopped feeling myself. Something that happened recently has caused me to slip even further.

I now constantly feel numb, and not connected to reality. The things that once brought me most joy, no longer do that anymore. I can't focus on anything. Not a book, movie, show, anime, or friends. 

Food doesn't interest me. Unless I binge eat, and even then I don't taste the food. The comfort foods no longer have a taste.

I don't even know who I am anymore. Who I need to be? Want to be? Am I me? What do I enjoy? 

Passing time has gotten harder. When you're numb, you are constantly trying to find something or someone to make you feel something. Even if it's not the best way to do so.

I eventually recovered but soon I got it again. It was only a mild case but it still felt horrible due to last grade. I felt like I was the bully instead and so I just felt horrible. I had mood swings. One day I would fell happy and the next I was sad again. I wasn't interested even though I was playing my favorite games and listening to good music. I still am dealing with this but I keep feeling worse. My mind always says this when I feel like my day is horrible.

Just had my yearly neurology appointment (over the phone because Covid) for my MS.

I broke down during the call because I've been struggling with depression for a long time now and have been too... scared I guess, to ask for help. 

They're referring me to my GP to start antidepressants.

An hour later my mum called and I told her they're recommending antidepressants. I've never outright mentioned feeling depressed to my parents (although I'm sure I displayed plenty of signs) so she was a bit surprised and asked why they were recommending them. 

I vaguely said my ""mood hasn't been great lately"" and it might help with sleep too (because I've had insomnia for years now and have barely slept in the last week). Overall downplayed the whole thing but I've been doing that for years so it was almost habit tbh 

Her reaction was ""oh, ok"" then launches into how wonderful and perfect her granddaughter has been today. 

Like don't get me wrong, my neice is cute, but I tell you I'm being prescribed antidepressants and that's all the interest you can take? Really?

I've felt so alone lately and knowing my own mum was that unaware of how much I'm struggling and so disinterested even now I've actually told her just drives it home even more"
ThrashMutant,2021-11-01 19:48:53+00:00,Just Waiting for the Right Moment to End It All,"I've decided to give up, or more accurately, I decided a long time ago that I would end up killing myself a long time ago, and I've finally decided to end it soon. I just need a place to post this so that I can get some things out, since I have nowhere else to turn. 

I had decided to go through with this a long time ago. I never really fit in, even as a child. I've always been alone, no real friends to turn to, no one permanent in my life. I've never really been able to connect, and any time that it seems like I've met a kindred spirit, I fuck it up with my mental instability.

I have no dreams or passions, no interests or motivation for things, and my apathy has only grown over time. 

Around this time last year I finally met someone, someone that felt like home. We instantly hit it off and we eventually started dating. It honestly felt like a dream come true, but like all dreams, it ended. 

Eventually she started to push me away and it all came to an end in an incredibly hurtful way. She broke up with me through text and made a ton of hurtful comments about how she didn't owe me anything. It honestly tore me apart, especially since all I ever did was try to be good, caring and understanding. No matter what I tried to say, it was all thrown back at me. Eventually I lashed out and said things I never meant. 

We tried being friends after that, but it seemed like I just pissed her off with my existence and it would lead to fights where I would lash out and say horrible things. Suffice to say that we don't talk anymore and that she hates me. Honestly, it was all my fault. The breakup wasn't my fault, but the hurt that came after was all my fault. 

I never told her this, but to me, she was my last hope for a future. I had pushed away everyone that had ever tried to get close to me, locked myself away from the world, all in preparation for my eventual suicide. I wanted to make sure that I couldn't hurt anyone once I passed. But for once, I forgot all of that, I forgot it all for her. I never told her, but she was the last little bit of faith that I had in the world, the last bit of faith that I could connect with anyone. 

But I see now that I'm not meant for this world, for this life. I'm not meant to connect, or love, or be loved. I don't belong here on this world and I've overstayed my welcome. All my life I've been shown that I don't belong, and I fooled myself into thinking otherwise. 

It's her birthday this month, and I won't even get a chance to see it,  to give her all of the wonderful things she deserved, and it breaks my heart. Clarissa, I'm so sorry for everything that happened between us. I'm so sorry for hurting you. 

But it's time to go, I just wish that I could have seen you smile one last time."
wassupitsjohnwick,2021-11-01 19:19:49+00:00,I went to college but I still haven't accomplished much in life. I'm always depressed.,"26M, I'm not that old but I've already passed the precious high school and college years without accomplishing much in adulthood. I had a lot of potential when I was younger (valedictorian in high school and magna cum laude in college), but I could never find a job with my degree (radio and television production) because I ""didn't have enough experience"" in the field. Even entry-level jobs required 3-5 years of experience. Since then, I've just been trying out different jobs that accept my degree but they are all low-paying, and I've gotten a lot of judgement from my family and my partner's family over the years because I don't make a lot of money. I'm depressed because I don't want to go back to school for a new degree and get into even more debt, but I feel like I'll never be successful or respected. I have several friends who also have college degrees but are broke and miserable because they also couldn't get a job with their degree, and they feel the same. 

I'm nearly 30 and I'm unhappy because I feel like I wasted my potential. I'm also in therapy and have tried several medications, but I can never stay happy for an extended period of time. I'm only happy when I'm hanging out with friends, going to comic cons, or playing video games. Outside of that, I'm always depressed about my life. How come I can never be happy even with the ""help"" of meds and therapists?"

All I think of is “when I was your age I had a family and a mortgage”. I can barely get a job because our criminal reform system is “next to” nonexistent, and though I’ve done my time and paid my dues, the world STILL won’t let me forget about the 2 bad years I had out of my 31 years on this earth.

I can’t even give my elderly parents a grandchild because parenthood has become a privilege for the wealthy. (And to have a child in this income bracket would be irresponsible and unfair to all parties involved.

I feel the chances of finding a lady who isn’t constantly checking her instagram or promoting her onlyfans, are slim to none. I was watching an 80’s themed movie and wondered why I was enjoying it so deeply, and I find that it’s because genuine human interactions are being portrayed, in a way that humans don’t actually interact in anymore. This genuinely frightens me. In the age of technology and togetherness I feel more alone than ever"

Heart feels no more pain
I know, I'll be on my way,
To heavens door,

When I finally die, and the blood dries in my veins then my heart will feel no more pain And I’ll be on my way to heavens door.

When my mind stops thinking,
My eyes stop blinking,
I hope
Somebodys there.

For a long time, a very long time I wanted to be happy and better. But depression and a shit load of other mental illnesses has ate me up and spat me back out. 
 
And my heart stops beating
And my lungs stop breathing
In air,
I hope somebody cares,

I just want someone to understand how I feel, everyone can say that they do but I can see past that sympathy engaging bullshit. I’ve never met anybody who understands my pain.

When my mind stops thinking
My eyes stop blinking
I know
At the end.

I’ll be gone forever. Forgotten or not, I’m at the point where I’m careless and daring. I couldn’t leave this place without showing the people I love how much appreciation I have for them, for making my time alive a lot better!

I’m at that stage of rock bottom where shit does not got any worse here. It’s kind of mind blowing how I just don’t follow standard human survival instincts anymore because I do not care about the outcome. Whether life or Death. 

I have appreciated every minute spent in this abhorrent life, I thank you people of Reddit. Every single second on Reddit has been beautiful. So much beautifulness with acid and other psychedelics. 

Thank you,"

It’s getting harder and harder to find even the simplest of reasons to wake up in the morning. I can feel myself becoming more and more bitter each passing day. I’m so sick and tired of seeing everyone so happy hanging out with their friends and celebrating the holidays together while I’m home alone barely able to keep myself from having a complete breakdown. I have no physical friends and all my online friends are just so inconsiderate and unaware of how painful it is being so alone. I hate complaining I know that no one cares and no one wants to hear how unhappy I am all the time. I just want one friend I can talk to that makes me feel like I genuinely have a reason to keep going. I want to have those fun goofy convos with someone about anything and everything, I don’t care what we talk about I just want a real friendship for once. I’m sorry I don’t know what I expect to get from expressing this. Maybe i just want someone to at least know I exist on the off chance I can make a friend who relates to me some."

I was home alone when one of them, a pitbull started attacking our other dog, it was vicious and bloody and extremely traumatizing for me to see one of my dogs being bitten so violently her ear almost came off and her neck was severely damaged. Because of this attack my moms boyfriend had to put her down. They haven’t said it completely, but they feel like its my fault that this happened. I did everything i could to convince them to just keep her alive and figure something out besides putting her down but they did it this past weekend. I don’t know how to feel because the whole house feels empty, my moms boyfriend has been acting so different and i feel terrible about myself for what happened. I wish she was here again and it’s not the time for me to be dealing with this when i was already going through another bad episode of depression.

been depressed for around 4/5 years due to various reasons (who cares not the point of this post), and this isolation has led to way less friends/interaction, which obviously will make you worse at socializing and has led to social anxiety yk the whole nine yards or whatever. this leads to everyone talking about them trying to make friends or just awkward situations with new people n stuff, see it all the time.

never have seen a post talking about awkwardness that depression causes with people you're very comfortable with (to be fair I haven't looked and they probably exist so, I might just be a dumbass). anyways people usually have their person they won't talk to about their depression and life details in general because it'll make them feel bad and then you'll feel bad, that person for me is my mother.

well this week I got excited because I thought I was going to a halloween party and I've been meaning to do this for years, got a costume and everything. party happened without me which made me upset but whatever, this happens all the time to me. what I wasn't ready for and still am not ready for is what my mother said to me, in the excitement, I told my mother about the party and how I got a costume and was excited about it. huge mistake because as I said, I don't tell her specific details for the purpose of not upsetting her.

well now she's asking about the halloween party and I realized how there's no way she won't figure out what happened. I don't really lie about anything in my life, never seen the point of it, tell my parents when I get speeding tickets, etc. But today I'm thinking about lying, for her sake.

Just seems weird how this awkwardness from social issues just infects everything, even things it has nothing to do with. Feel the same with trusting people, I now have issues trusting some of my best friends because of social shit.

i dunno :p"

i don’t know how to explain all of this to them, let them know it’s not them, but me. one of my roommates is extremely judgmental and closed minded, so no matter what i say i know she will twist it around and throw it back at me. they’ve been avoiding me since we had the talk, and it’s only making it worse. 

i left the talk bawling my eyes out, i couldn’t stay here so i left and stayed the night at a friends. not a single one of them reached out to see if im okay, they didn’t ask why i didn’t come home. they just let it happen.

I continued to attempt both of those things, but failed to gain access to anything. I don’t know what or how my parents found out, but they did. Oh, I should mention I’m a bisexual male. I already came out (my family is Catholic), and the reception has pretty much been pretending it didn’t happen. We just don’t talk about it. Anyways, they found out but didn’t say anything to me, they just tightened restrictions without explanation, but it didn’t stop my attempts. 

March 22nd, 2021, 3:30 AM: Two men enter my room while I’m sleeping, wake me up, and tell me to pack up my things now. They tell me nothing. They immediately take my phone. It was either comply or be forced, so I simply complied and packed up my stuff. They put me in a van, and we drive away for about one hour and then I’m dropped off at a “rehabilitation” facility. No surprise, it was “Christ-based”.

March 22-May 14th: I get lucky, I only have about a forty-five day stay. Most have ninety. I wont go into to too much detail, but it was conversion therapy. I left with no identity, having no idea who I am or want to be. I’m harassed for my sexuality the entire time I’m there, everyone is religious and they force it on us like its nobodies business. It’s bad

May 14th-August 19th: I do nothing. I get a job at Chick-Fil-A where I am again, harassed. I’ve done my best to reinvent myself because I was brainwashed into hating my old self but I can’t do it. I am who I am. I still expect things to be different. I mean, I’m no longer having any bad mental thoughts, I’m not using substances, so why is it not getting better? Why? They said it would. School is about to start and I don’t even know if people remember me because I’m banned from communication with anyone outside of work and family.

August 19th- School begins, and I naively expect it to be different. I was brainwashed into believing I was an addict and thats the root of my issues, so then I should be better now. I should make friends fast and fit in with the kids I’ve always wanted to fit in with. But, I don’t. No one talks to me. I’m insecure, lonely, I have hair-pulling issues so I’m insecure of my hair, and while I know I’m bi, I don’t really feel like I’m bi. I feel like I don’t dress gay enough, I’m not skinny, I have messes up hair, its just bad. Nothings changed and I have fewer friends than before all of the BS.

October 31st, today- I’m in my bedroom, no plans for Halloween, complaining to strangers on a subreddit. I try to make it obvious I want to do something but no one cares. I don’t exist outside of school. I wake up, go to school, eat, and sleep. I’m not trying to be edgy, please don’t give me crap for the style of writing, I don’t do it often. I just needed to vent."

So this happened sometime back. I was extremely depressed due to a lot of stuff going on. But I had a girlfriend, who was my support system and favourite person. 

One night, perhaps sick of my nihilistic and bleak outlook, she told me to focus on good things. She gave me an example. She had been to a trip with her family, and it was the first time in a year that she got out (COVID). She had been quite depressed too during this time, and when she got out she felt better. 

She told me that despite being quite down, she saw a pram with infant twins. One of them accidently hurt the other with his fist, and the hurt kid started crying. The kid who hit him immediately started carressing his sibling and tried to coax him, and they started smiling. She says that this showed her that there is still happiness in the world, and we should look around and use these small things to look past the negativity we had in the last year or so. I liked this story. I made it a point to look for good things.

Next day, she broke up with me.

And thats the thing with me. Some people get to see cute babies. I get abandoned by the person I care about the most. I cant be positive. I have no reason to be. This is how my life is, and this is how I have been always."

I can’t talk to anyone about it because all I could bring up is whatever had just put me over the edge, and then I look like even more of a baby.

These breakdowns of sadness only usually last a couple days at most, but when it does I can’t help but always think, do I have closeted depression? Have I learned to block out the sadness and assumed it’s because I’m happy when really I’m just depressed but good at suppressing? 

What the hell do I do? How can I healthily get sad from time to time without bottling it all up and absolutely crying my eyes out when the bottle fills up? Who the hell do I talk to? How do I tell my loved ones that I’m having a really hard time from time to time because of my habit of bottling up emotions? I’m sick and tired of pretending everything’s okay just for it to blow up in my face and go full on depressed mode until I can get a grip and bottle all those feelings right back up. 

Do I have a problem? Is that a mental health problem? Should I see a therapist even though I’m not the worst of the worst depressed?"

My wife has gone out of her way to get mad at me the whole trip and to make fun of me in front of her family.  Yesterday she got mad because I forgot to set out the pizza toppings for hobo pies for dinner.  This lead to her saying that she has expectations and I'm not meeting them.  After 16 years of marriage we agree that I'm nothing but a big disappointment to her and our boys.

It all boils down to me asking myself ""Why do I bother?"""

Yesterday I thought ""I could easily do it, because I'm alone most of the time and I could die in peace here, the stiletto is right there"". So I walked and I sat on my chair, I looked at the stiletto for a few minutes, I didn't want to but seemed like the only way to rest.

I haven't tried anything, I don't want to, I want things to get better, but I'm afraid someday I will try it.

It's just too much thing happening to me, I can't deal with it alone and I don't want to tell anyone about this, never.

I actually just tried to tell my friend about a part of those things, but I deleted. Idk what to do, I simply cant handle this."

But I talking it out with him has become pointless at this point cause he still doesn't comprehend me, I don't think I understand him, like I'm sitting here thinking he's out to help people so they can take that and make something out of it but now I just don't understand why he's so negative about everything but then when he tells me something good it's something that he wants or visions for the future like I don't just don't understand why he's not happy that I want more life like I don't fuckin get it"
TiffedDoordashDriver,2021-10-31 04:27:12+00:00,Everyone I love or am supposed to trust either betrays or abandons me,"I tried so hard to be perfect all the time. To be the best student, daughter, sister, employee, partner, friend. Only to get emotionally, verbally, and physically abused by my family, hurt by someone I loved and trusted more than anyone, and treated as the black sheep of the family. One of my siblings was the scapegoat who got the brunt of the toxicity. We helped each other through it. They got away from this shitshow, and unfortunately that meant we no longer can communicate, and now the target is turned on to me. I'm the step-child, the outsider. Of course I don't belong.

I'm done trying. I am so bitter. I have to be around people who go out of their way to harass and mistreat me. I had the pleasure of overhearing a family member shit talk about me with one of my other family members and they both had the audacity to pretend to be so sweet and kind to my face. They started acting weird around me and nervous. I think they knew I overheard them. It pisses me off having to be around them. I will never be enough for anyone. I am cursed.

I don't want to be loved by anyone if being loved means being betrayed or abandoned. I don't want to be loved at all anymore. Maybe what I needed to realize is that I never needed to be loved in the first place. Maybe the reason people keep doing this to me is because I was weak and needy, and they saw that and exploited it. I attracted abusers and let them abuse me. I'm not doing that anymore.

I'm moving out as soon as I can, even if it means I have to start over from scratch. At least I'll be free."

I start talking to a girl that likes me and my dog who I’ve had since I was 2 years old dies. That hits hard, I didn’t tell any of my friends until about a month after. I cried many nights. After a while I finally got my spirit back up and started being more active socially again at school. In one of my classes I start talking to this girl, she is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen and she is also the funniest girl I have ever met. I talk to her for a while and get to know her more, unlike a lot of girls she makes me laugh, genuinely laugh. Every time I talk to her my heart feels warm. Then just as I’m almost ready to present my feelings, she’s lesbian. I know this isn’t the worst thing that happening to anyone but I seriously love her. She means a lot to me and she doesent even know it. And now I know that I can’t be with her, that hit my heart so hard and so painfully. I haven’t cried in a month and tonight I just cried for a whole hour straight.

As I’m in my teens specifically 14 now I believe life doesn’t really have a purpose. I wake up everyday to go to the same school and study the same things, on the weekends I wake up to just play the same games by myself. 

I rarely go out with my family and my father is currently going through depression . I barley do anything fun, my family doesn’t even celebrate Halloween, so the only thing I’m looking forward to at the minute is Christmas (which I’m truly grateful for). But I have to get through another 2 months straight of school before that.

This is weird I guess but I also constantly feel horny, I cope with that how any teenager would but it doesn’t even feel good anymore, I just do it to get rid of my horniness that just comes back 10 hours later.

I see all my friends going out with their families and doing fun things with friends on the daily, which for me is a rare opportunity.

I guess this was sort of a rant and maybe I’m just being really selfish.
I just want to go back to playing minecraft and not caring about a things. 
Maybe I just need to grow up."

Rosalie_bird,2021-10-30 21:37:53+00:00,The reason why I’m suicidal,"
After I graduated high school, I decided to go to law school in Germany, where I live.
In case there’s any Germans reading this, they’ll know that the German bar exam is one of the hardest exams in the world. 
It consists of 6 exams, 5 hrs each and then an oral exam. After 10 (!) semesters, students take 1-2 years off to study for it, most of them study long hours 7 days a week. The worst part is, that there’s a 50% failure rate and you can only repeat it once. Once you fail a second time you’re left with nothing. 
So I’m currently preparing for this exam and it’s not going very well. It’s too much pressure and the worst part is that all my family members and especially my boyfriend’s parents are constantly telling me to “hurry up” because I’m already 26 years old and my biological clock is ticking and I also need to earn money. All this talk is giving me additional anxiety. 
The other day, my boyfriend’s parents gave me an ultimatum. They said that I’ll have to graduate before Christmas this year or otherwise they’ll do everything in their power for my boyfriend to break up with me. But I know that I won’t be ready to take the exam until Christmas, I still have 31 books left to read and study, I need at least another 6 months. 
They didn’t go to college themselves, hell, my MIL is a housewife who didn’t even graduate high school. Yet they’re bullying me and telling me I’m a loser because other ppl my age have families and own houses Meanwhile I still haven’t graduated college. 
They constantly put me down and make me feel really bad for being in law school. They don’t believe in me.
I really don’t know what to do I cry myself to sleep every night.
The pressure of it all is just too high. I’m constantly thinking about suicide because I’m a loser to everyone even though I worked so hard my entire life. While others were ihr partying I was pulling all nighters studying. And now I’m being attacked for my choices. Life just sucks I might as well just end it all."
catmomma235,2021-10-30 19:32:16+00:00,one of the hardest things about being depressed is the lack of support and understanding from my family,"sometimes I really hate my parents. I'm 24 &amp; moved back in with them bcus of $$ and they have resolved to just ignoring my existence and kind of denying anything is wrong. my mother especially refuses to have conversations with me about how I feel she has hurt me in the past. Whenever I had tried to seek comfort from them they act annoyed and like I'm being dramatic. the worse is that they just joke about me sleeping all day and mocking me when I tell them I want them to be more supportive. I went through sexual abuse as a child and can't help but get really angry at the fact I never had parental figures who could help me the way I needed them to. I was lucky enough that they believed me &amp; removed the abusers, but also I think they use that as leverage to say I have no reason to be upset at anything else they have ever done. it's exhausting. I could do something to myself or have a breakdown and it would be spun as my poor parents being stuck with a crazy daughter. I am nothing but a disappoint and a cross for them to bear. I feel tolerated not wanted."

I still have my business which is something, but I feel a total failure. I have no wife and kids and I guess I’m lonely too and to top it off I’ve done this to myself. Is there any hope for me?

throwawaydotcom321,2021-10-30 17:35:59+00:00,Feeling Extreme Guilt and Depression Over Dropping Food," I accidentally dropped some bread on the floor which our family were supposed to eat, and apologised repeatedly and begged and begged my mother to just throw it away.

But she insisted on just wiping it off thoroughly, putting it in the oven, and eating it afterwards anyway.

My mother ate food that had been on the FLOOR- because of me.

I've already made mistakes recently and I feel like such a worthless piece of trash right now. I feel like this incident will just haunt me forever, and I can never be happy again, because I just don't deserve it.

What kind of person serves food off the FLOOR to their own mother??

She already said it's no big deal but I just can't bring myself to think so... the fact that she's eaten food that fell on the FLOOR- while it was in MY hand just isn't letting me live right now.

I'm not sure what anyone here could say to me to make this better (because what's done is done- it can't be undone), but I couldn't think of anywhere else to put this, so I'm putting this here.

Thanks for reading."

I think I'd be better off dead really but maybe I do have a reason to keep living: To become the failure so that other people can succeed and feel better about themselves. Nothing I have worked hard and actually cared about for has ever worked out for me. I'm stuck in academia studying a useless subject I couldn't give two fucks about while knowing I'm pissing my future prospects away with every second I can't spend on drawing. The career I hope to have is way beyond reach and even attempting feels like running on a hamster wheel: You can delude yourself into thinking one day you might just be good enough but the truth is you're stuck running in circles while the rest of the world watches on in pity. The most validation I can get is someone telling me my art is good and that ""one day I'll get there"" but I know they don't see how fucking incompetent I really am because social media is a curated presence. People just give me pity praise and headpats but no one actually wants to hire me for anything. If I can't get good at anything at all, I'll still keep living but not for myself: I'll keep living just to show others what they should never become.

I’m 16 years old and have never really had trouble making friends. I’ve never had a best friend or a close friend however that never really bothered me that much until this year when I lost all my friends and have felt so lonely. Im too nice of a person to take up for myself and let people walk right over me and call me names and i don’t do anything about it. I have always had trouble learning in school because I have adhd and learning disabilities which makes school very difficult. This stresses me out because I have never gotten good grades even if I try my hardest so it’s gotten to the point where I don’t try anymore. My grades are too bad and I feel like it’s too late to fix them.   Since my grades have been so poor I feel like have no future ahead of me. The teachers have called me names like idiot, moron, worthless, and a failure. This took place at a private Christian school where people think nothing bad happens there. When I was there it was filled with bad influences. School got so stressful for me that I ran away from home and my parents ended up calling the police on me about this. I’ve always felt like a failure because I’ve never had a girlfriend and I have never really accomplished anything huge. I’m not very shy but I’m a very awkward person. There was this one girl at my school that I would talk to every day and I liked her for 3 years. I would go home and think about her all day. After 3 years I decided to make the decision to tell her I like her. After I did that she said she wanted to stay friends and I was fine with that. The next day I came to school her friends were making fun of me and she never talked to me since. After all these events happening I fell into depression and it has ruined my life. I lost all my friends because I don’t even talk to anyone anymore. I have switched schools and it has just gotten me more stressed out and I don’t see me making friends with anyone there because it’s a very small school. I am now taking medicine for this depression I have and it seems to only make me feel worse. I don’t know what to do about this anymore I sure hope I’m not the only one facing stuff like this."

Can I pass through that again? Idk, but what else I can do? I need to move out, I need to move on, I'm fucking trying my best, but literally nothing has changed, nothing that I wanted to change has changed. The feelings are always there, I just don't know what to do anymore.

This is eating me from the inside and I bet it's going to kill me, I don't deserve this, why bad things keep happening to me? I didn't do anything, my life hasn't even started yet and I already losted a lot of things, things that I didn't even get the chance to have.

I'm tired, I want to rest, today I took the day of to rest and now I'm fucking sad again."

LuisBunuelL0ver,2021-10-29 16:40:37+00:00,Lost in Repetition,"Hi,

I've never written one of these posts before, but I've been feeling so overwhelmed lately and thought I'd give it a shot.

Recently I've started my last year of secondary education (A-Levels) and it's not that I'm unable to find time for myself, but when I do take the time to sit down and do work I find it almost impossible to get any work done.

I think it's something to do with the repetition of going over the same things time and time again, but my mind just can't handle it anymore. I sit at my desk and look out of my window for most of the hours of my study days because I can't face going over what I've already done a million times.

On top of that it feels like school is just taking away from what I personally want to be doing in life. It's all work and none of it is aiding me in any progression towards the career I wish for, and the career I do want doesn't even require A-Levels or a university (college) degree (diploma?) - of course, it would still be beneficial to have A-Levels though.

I don't know, but its all just getting too overwhelming. Maybe its just my age and other fears mixed in.

Has anyone felt similarly and/or has ways they think I could help the matter?

Thank you if you've read this far."
Significant-Comb-677,2021-10-29 13:42:16+00:00,I'm tired.,"I did post in this group before about my life. I still didn't go to get help. I'm just tired. I really want to give up. I try, try, try and try. But nothing works out. It feels like there's a wall that's blocking my future. It feels like no one sees me or notice my existence.
I tried to do my music career it turned out a failure. Then I worked my ass off everyday. I tried to start an onlyfans but it doesn't work out and I'm not like that. I tried to make apps. One big dating app for the LGBTQ+ community. It didn't work out. Everything I do. I try to make my life better. But it doesn't workout. There's so many things bothering me it's just to much to put it out here. What should I do? I feel like a failure and it feels like nothing is working out. Everywhere I go the doors are locked and I can't find an open one."

Gambl33,2021-10-29 09:22:33+00:00,I don’t think I’ve been okay for a while,I made a post on another subreddit asking for assistance because I’m in a bad place financially but I feel like I’m starting to realize I haven’t been okay for a long time. Let’s just say it’s been a shitty month and what I didn’t mention over there was that my grandmother and aunt had passed away earlier this month just two weeks apart. Just all these waves of emotions coming at me hard and fast. But I think me not feeling okay has been going on for years now. I remember in my early 20s I wanted to own a restaurant. I started working in restaurants since I was in High School. After school I worked washing dishes and then I kept moving up. I worked behind a chef in my 20s but the long hours really got to me. I was working almost 14 hour days for years when I finally burnt out and my passion for the industry died. I took time off after but go sick one day for a long time then my appendix ruptured. Got hit with a huge bill. Opened up credit cards in panic and tried to work them off but ultimately filed for bankruptcy. Went to work at warehouses for long hours again then covid hit. Got laid off and did food deliveries to make ends meet. Now I just had an emergency dental surgery that has settled me with another debt and I feel like I’m repeating years prior. I’m just laying here having a sleepless night wondering where did I lose hope along the way? I don’t feel okay this time. I keep trying to find a better tomorrow but I don’t see it.
HereOnTheHighway,2021-10-29 07:31:03+00:00,Does anyone else feel like you've been given a death sentence?,"This will be just me rambling on to get some of my thoughts out, but I wanted to see if anyone else has felt like this too. For a quick backstory, I've had severe depression and at times crippling anxiety/paranoia for most of my life due to bad childhood enviroment. I've moved out on my own some years ago, but my mind is still just as fucked up as it was when I was a kid. 

I was watching this video on YouTube about a death sentence culture in Asia (It was either Japan or China), and the way it works there is that you are locked up, but they won't tell you when the execution date is. It might be in 4 hours, or 15 years. That's exactly how my mental illness feels like for me. I know that some day my mental conditions will get too much, and then it will all be over. I'm sure you can guess what I mean by that. 

It can be the tiniest thing that happens in my life, that will send me down a spiral of catasthrophizing, anxiety, fear that something will happen to me and just severe depression. I might have a good week or even good months, but eventually I will be back lying on my bed just shaking with uncontrollable fear and feeling that my life is fucked up beyond recovery, and the only way out is well, you know.

This has been going on for many many many years, and I am just wondering when it will get too much. It just feels destined to happen at one point. Like it HAS to happen, and it's meant to be that way. I honestly can't in my wildest dreams imagine me living to an old age, or even 20 more years. It feels like it's not meant to happen for me, and the most twisted thing is that I'm completely fine by it. I've accepted it. Even when I have my good weeks/months."

I ask because, well here’s the real meat of the sandwich….. my family and I are moving out of state. The past few months I have been basically saying my goodbyes to everyone. Like goodbye, I’m moving far away but I’ve been secretly thinking I’ll just move and off myself. I haven’t shared this with anyone, it’s just a thought i had. I haven’t thought of how or when or anything. I think I was just coping with the stress. I told my boyfriend about it, as I try to voice my depression but it always falls on deaf ears, and he is horrified and thinks I’m a psycho I think…….."

buckbuck24,2021-10-28 04:18:58+00:00,"Feeling down, but just more often, and more broadly","Hi there

I want to start off by saying I haven't really had issues with depression or really much of anything psychological in the past, which I'm grateful for. Recently, I've noticed that I'm just kind of, tired-ish more often. When I'm alone I feel, just eh. I know I'm not depressed, but I almost feel like I'm sinking a bit deeper into this, so I want to get some advice.

I'm in college, but because of covid, I've really not been able to meet many people that I really click with. I don't feel as engaged in my classes as I did even last semester. I don't know, it just doesn't really feel like what I'm doing with myself right now is worth anything, if that makes sense. 

I'm worried as the weather gets shittier, and there are fewer social gatherings this will only get worse. If anyone has some advice as to ways to 'break the mold' I would be so grateful. I just want to be excited about doing something :)"
Stock_Efficiency9371,2021-10-28 03:24:18+00:00,Idk why I’m here,"

Why am I alive after everything? Every time my life looks like it’s figured out and I can move on, I get bitch slapped with regret, horrible thoughts, or just straight terrible luck. My mother neglected? Me. Idk if it really was, my room consisted of a dresser with my clothes and a mattress on the floor. (We were pretty middle class family, Street dad was an tech engineer and mom job hopped from nursing to office jobs) I never really got to eat with the family unless it was some big holiday and other family was around. She never really talked to me unless it was to say something like “why aren’t your grades A?” “You were late to school” (context I had to walk everywhere, dentist appointment? Walk an hour or so there. School? 20 min walk every morning and evening) I finally got out after my dad was able to Keep a stable enough income to take me in to when I was about 17. Got a job and everything was looking fine, long story short my dads, girlfriends, daughters, boyfriend. (Hopefully that made sense) was an absolute dick and abused her, she got in an accident and a lot of saved up money was used to pay the hospital bills cause she didn’t have insurance. When I was 18 or so I went back to my moms because, no rent and I thought being 18 would be a lot easier to deal with anything that happened. (Didn’t have to be home if I didn’t want to, could work long shifts and save money to get out ASAP) didn’t work as she kicked me out because I refused to tell her what was in my bank account. I was homeless for about a year because of this and working McDonald’s cause they were the only ones that would hire me with no where to go. Covid hit and we ask got laid off for a bit, thankfully I ran into an old friend who lived in the big cities and offered me to stay with them til I was back on my feet. Everything was going great, was saving up money was slowly making a new group of friends because I lost all contact with previous friends, when I was homeless I had to sell a lot of stuff I had to get extra money for food. My phone had then changed and I lost all their numbers and info. I was looking at apartments, finding my own place and taking tours. Found one and just needed one more paycheck and I was set to get some furniture and move in. I get a call from my friends mom, who then tells me that they are remodeling the basement and need me out in a week. I had to quickly get a hold of whoever I could (thankfully my dad saved me again), and I was able to move back in with my dad earlier this year. Got a new job, saved up a bit more and did more apartment hunting, got song cheap furniture from garage sales, finally found a place, and a job near there. The entire friends I thought I made in the cities then blocked me, no warning or anything. I moved in to my own new place, started up work, got promoted about two months later, and now it’s been 4 months since. Ask I Keep thinking about, is what is going to happen now? Something always happened.. something always came by and ruined everything. What is it going to be this time? Am I going to be robbed? The apartment burned down? Work closes for some unknown reason leaving me with no income? On top of this I have no one I know around, closest family is a 2 hour drive  away, I was never able to get a car cause my mom never let me try for a license and my dad was always so busy trying to keep his own life together. I don’t have any friends, anyone I talk to or meet wether through games or at work cancels plans we make or just dips and ghosts. I start to think why do people even try with me? I had a thought last night, I could die and literally no one would know. Would be months before anyone realized. All I do is work, come home, sleep, and spend the few hours I have trying to be happy in this silent lonely home. I don’t even know why I’m typing this, I just feel so scared that something is going to happen again and ruin all this that I’ve worked for. Or that I won’t get to pursue any of my passions and make a career out of it or something til I’m 40 cause I simply can’t waste the money. I’m just lost, feeling like this is all my life is going to amount to if nothing ruins it and if something does I won’t have anyone to fall back on for aid this time. 

TLDR: I don’t even know, basically a life story.. I’m lost and alone and afraid something is going to ruin everything I’ve finally worked for"

Would call me names under her breath, spread rumors about me and made indirect threats. Started paper and was going to report her, but she got wind of it and decided to report me instead. Investigation came back unfounded but I was so stressed I lost 8 lbs. Well I'm back now... I'm back to school on GI, full-time job, good place to live...instead of doing things I like I just meme all night. Didn't know I wasn't ok while overseas. Tried to avoid this NCO but most of my team was old friends with the NCO and they ended up not liking me because they thought I was anti social when really was just trying to avoid so and so... It just crept up on me. I  like horror and drama but could only watch comedy, anything else was too much. Worked 7 days a week, 12, sometimes 15 hours a day and after shift couldn't move from my chair, just sat there. Now I'm back and I'm so anxious all the time still just sitting here. Feel paralyzed and can't stand any uncertainty or anything that feels like it'll get confrontational. Can't seem to care about school or work or my goals. SO is asking me if I'm alright all the time. I'm not, but I'm ok if that makes sense. Just can't seem to get off the couch. Anyways. Just wanted to put that out there."

Akira0995,2021-10-27 13:43:16+00:00,I just had a breakdown.. Long post ahead..,"As the title says, I'm currently at work and I just experience these breakdowns from time to time, I suddenly feel lonely to the point that I have to hold back tears and hide my emotions from people around me, to avoid embarrassment. I'm a young adult, working overseas, living miles away from my family, and of course self-diagnosed as mentally depressed..

My first time posting here and I just want to share here my story and current situation as I'm not really confident enough to share with other people or friends except my girlfriend, and I also can't find any other good online platforms to vent this out to.

I'm currently living with my girlfriend and her family which is really degrading and uncomfortable for me (at least her mom insists that I have to live with them, since there's still the pandemic), and working a job I'm totally not interested in with a very minimum wage despite the company's size and reputation in the industry.

Since childhood I've been aware of the looming debts of my Dad (This was clear to me as I never paid for school fees with cash or in full instead always with promissory notes), and as I grew I found it as just another hurdle he have to go through himself, I didn't see it as much of a problem to be concerned with at that time (probably me, not being matured yet). Back in 2018 I resigned from my first ever job, which I really hated, seizing an opportunity to work abroad (expecting to get a better source of income, and already bothered by the financial problems the family is facing.) before I left the country, I had a seizure and was hospitalized, I never had the diagnosis from the hospital as they advised me to do a lumbar tap (not sure if this is the actual term) and EEG, which from how it sounds might be expensive, and I, regardless of the consequences, I did the sacrifice to not go through it anymore, and it was torture being in a hospital bed trying to fake sleep while listening to my parents call everyone they knew to borrow money, partly for the hospital bills (luckily I still had medical insurance for in-patient), but mostly for them to pay interests from debts (not even for the capital), so the situation was actually paying a debt with another debt. 

1 month overseas and I already found a job which I really loved and saw worth investing in, I worked in a production house and was really looking forward to my potential career in this industry, mostly in photography and video-editing. Fast-forward to December 2019, this was my first and last time to go back home, when I arrived at the airport, I called my mom, told her I was feeling sick and needs to be hospitalized (it was a prank), then 9 hours later, just for her to see me standing in front of our gate, and I can't describe how happy I was seeing how happy they were to see me, this was probably the last time I felt genuine happiness, it was priceless. I was picked up by my friends from the airport and I stayed home for a month. And I was really heartbroken, not because of love, but because of our current circumstance, the state the house was in, it was barely being kept together by the family, tv's not working, piled up bills, and the fact that them being happy was temporary due to me being there.  It was heartbreaking.

After my vacation, I've managed to motivate and push myself again to go further and work harder as much as I can, the goal was always to give them a happy life and I always kept this in mind and heart. It was a good start of the year, and then, this Pandemic came, the company I worked for closed, and I was unemployed for more than a year, I sold off almost all my stuff, I lived off of some freelance jobs and barely making ends meet. I was devastated. I thought the situation I was in couldn't get any worse, well jokes on me. During this time, I would often wake up at 3-4 in the morning not knowing why, and realizing how shit my life has become, I would often cry, I'm living in another family's house, taking up space, I've lost all self-esteem, not knowing exactly where I need to be in life, not seeing any potential in myself anymore, and not having any idea anymore how to get my family out of this hole. My mom and siblings would always message me and see how I'm doing, and of course I always tell them ''I'm okay'', as they try to sound okay themselves to keep me from being sad. 

Fast forward to present, I've never missed a call from my mom, every month, asking if I got money to spare, just to chip off some interest from her outstanding debts (She has always helped my Dad to look for ways to solve this financial problem, taking up loans to pay for loans, and now being financially incapacitated as well.) I always send her all my salary saying it's the money ''I can spare'' to not worry her, literally, if not just 90% of it, just to use 10% for my monthly transportation and food expenses and sometimes I would use the company petty cash and just pay it off from my next salary, basically, I'm working now to earn money, to be sent to them, to pay only for interests, So, I'm technically working to earn money for nothing, at least I somehow help them (The only consolation I get).

I've always been hard on my siblings pushing them to do more and help with our financial problem, on my elder brother who is studying law and working multiple part-time just to keep himself afloat, my eldest brother who I was really close with, and now working in a call center just to help out as well, and my sister who I've struggled with paying her school fees in medical school, It was really painful, trying to convince her to stop as we don't have the resources anymore to continue (as if we ever had), despite her passion in her dream of becoming a doctor. It was really hard for me, not being able to stand up for her, when she had recently asked from her friends if they can help her and I was helpless, it was really painful.

Recently, our car has been repossessed by a creditor, and my mom has been looking to sell our house, our home, she is also planning to work abroad as a care taker despite her age and my Dad trying to find a job as well, and living in the province to hide from people chasing him for his debts, I also have my aunt who manages our small convenience store which use to be filled with products and now is scheduled to be put down due to unpaid rent, and if this is not rock bottom, I don't know what is, I have come to a point that I feel like something might happen to them anytime soon, that some people might do something bad to them, and the only thing I can do is still try to work hard hoping there could be a miracle or just accept it or whatever :( I usually escape from all this by playing video games online with my friends, which has not helped me entirely anyway, sometimes it just reminds me how bad my life is compared to them, and even at work I always look at other people and wonder if they go through this hell as well, or if I would ever experience again how happy they are living their lives right now, I'm really envious.

The idea of hurting myself and suicidal thoughts have crossed my mind but I'm thankful that I am conscious enough not to actually consider them, I'm aware that there is nothing good that will come from it, and it will just spread the sadness that is welling up inside me.

Sometimes, I just hope I win the lottery, or luckily find a duffel bag full of bundled up cash, I even play some online games in the hopes of making it to the pro scene and eventually win some big prices from e-sports competitions (This was my dream). 

I don't want to trigger anyone already going through a tough time and is lonely at the moment, Just want to share this to anyone going through the same problems. Despite my post, I still want everyone else feeling depressed, regardless of how our lives have been, and how withered we have become from our former happy selves, to still always hope. I still believe, and I still badly long for that genuine happiness, I hope you guys do too.."

I’ve been having dreams about him lately and now that I’m out of my most recent, horrible relationship, I realize how perfect my first boyfriend was. We were best friends and the most important part is that I could tell him anything. I have like the worlds worst trust issues, I honestly have never trusted someone like I trust him, it took me a while to open up to him too, he is the only person that knows everything about me. Something REALLY fucked up happened to me tonight and I’m so sad because I just want to tell him and have him tell me everything will be ok, but we haven’t talked in like 2 years and he has a girlfriend ….. I don’t want to be like a home wrecker or anything but I feel like I will need to get this off my chest soon, should I like text him and explain myself that he’s the only person I trust to tell and I really need to talk to someone ? The thing is I’d want to do it in person too because it’s just not the same over text, and I really want to see him. I wouldn’t try anything to ruin his current relationship so I shouldn’t be seen as a threat to his gf but also a part of me wants him to still want me loll."

AngryPuffin6,2021-10-27 05:22:54+00:00,I (14m) want to give up,"2020: I was the happiest 7th grader you could've met, I was nearly always happy and bubbly and just an all around fun person to be around. Covid hits, we were told we would be back in a couple weeks. Doesn't happen, we never went back that school year and then I moved in the summer, so basically because my parents didn't let me have a phone I lost contact with all my friends. I got really depressed, I need people to function and my family was driving me insane. I cut myself that fall, it was October 15th. I barely survived that. I was bleeding for an hour and i didn't care, so i was just bleeding out while my parents were away at work. An a hour and a half goes by, I'm light headed. I think to myself ""why am I doing this?"" And just kinda drag myself and I grab a towel, press on my wrist for a good half hour, and just had like 15 bandaids om it until 5pm, about 30 minutes until my mom would be home. I just only wore long sleeves for all winter to cover up the scars, my parents still don't know. I threw the towel in a trash bag and took it out later with the normal trash. I go to in person school for about 2 weeks after that and unexpectedly go virtual for another 3 months. That nearly pushed me towards a second attempt. 

2021: Capital riots in Washington D.C.


My grandparents best friend and her husband died, someone fell asleep behind the wheel and drove straight through their bedroom at 1 am.

 I go back to in person school for a bit, start making a couple friends. Of course we move again in the summer and i still don't have a phone to contact people

During the summer: my parents separate for a month (they are together and doing better then ever rn)  I get a phone, contact a couple people. My best friend (who happens to be a girl who I have a huge crush on) gets a boyfriend. Wasps terrorize me all summer, I had at least 5 stings by August.

 School starts, Its alright enough. Pretty much right away fights start happening every day in school. I feel kinda down on my luck, everything sucks. 

Then fast forward a week before homecoming. A girl who i had a small crush on but knew it wasn't happening (or so i thought) asks me to homecoming. I say yes, (obviously, I'm not an idiot) and then later asks if we're dating, i say suree, so I'm assuming you like me and she said yes and so we started dating ig. We go really well for the first week, homecoming happens and i follow her around and try to chill but i don't know anyone. Next two weeks ars just kinda more meh and she breaks up with me on the Monday of what would've been our 4th week. It didn't tear me up too much, just for about 2 days and it hurta every so often but it didn't hurt as bad as a 3 year relationship would've. 

Then on Thursday my great aunt died

And on sunday we had to give one of our cats back to the shelter

And yesterday i found out my best friends mom could die

And i got grounded

So I don't have my phone playing music to keep my suicidal thoughts at bay, and its getting harder to even care."

I stopped complaining about feeling bad because I get called a liar when I do. I don't feel like I'll ever deserve love or to feel wanted. I'm in a relationship but it feels like it's something else.  He can be so loving but then so angry and always says I'm lying when I'm not. Today I gave up and stopped trying to defend myself.  I feel like there's no point anymore. I feel like even when I try it's never enough..for anything.  I've been wanting to end it all more and more but I'm afraid of what could be after..so I don't and I'm here just existing.  I have no one to talk to and I don't think I want it at this point because people don't actually care. They try and say things for awhile but it becomes to much and they leave.  Always leave.  I know I have trouble..more than most and it's really frustrating and lonely. I'm unable to read body language and tone due to brain injury when I was 4. It's caused so much stress and annoyance from others. I feel so alone and frustrated. I just don't want to exist

I have my aunts and uncles looking over me wanting to know why I wasn’t out of the house at 18, with a wife and a house. I’m no one unless I’m successful. 

And I’m ugly. I hate my appearance. When I see pretty people, I get sad. I’m practically conditioned to think “*those* people are not for *me*”. I steer clear of people because I know I’m just an annoyance to them. 

I was weeping in my car on the way home. Had to make an excuse to my parents why my eyes were red. Fuck I just want what everyone else wants. I want to feel loved but I can’t find it anywhere. 

I have zero friends. I want to be wanted, I want to be needed. I want to stop feeling so tired and useless to those around me. I want to die. I cannot find any joy in pressing on in my life."
Snoo_24645,2021-10-26 23:22:42+00:00,Is there some connection between mindfulness and coping with suicidal thoughts?,"I have practiced mindfulness more in the context of anxiety, like breathing when I feel panic coming on. But, of course, mindfulness can be a deeper practice that involves having a different relationship to your thoughts and ""insight"" into the nature of mind. Has it helped anyone with suicidal ideation/thoughts? I'm trying to just mindfully observe them as impermanent, while not trying to resist it or suppress the thoughts. What's your experience or view on how mindfulness relates to suicidal thoughts or depression altogether? How exactly might it help or any techniques/pointers? I'm desperate.."

Constant-Response-71,2021-10-26 23:10:52+00:00,Just wanna get stuff off my chest,"TW: Trauma, SA, Suicide, Miscarriage, Abuse

Hi, F23 here. Not really actively looking for advice, just need to rant anonymously. Been suffering from depression for about 7 years now. Along my long journey, I've learned way to cope and how to behave when I feel like I'm losing my mind. It's been hard. 

Currently from an outside perspective, my life seems to be going somewhere. Working a part-time job that I enjoy, own a budgie that I adore, attending college and working towards a certificate (because a bachelor's would take too long and mentally drain me on the long run). Loving boyfriend of 3 years and going strong, good relationship with a small group of 3 friends. Lately, it's just been feeling like I'm stuck in this loop of thinking my life is going no where, and that I'm going to be like this forever.

Some background about me, and this is where I really only going to mention things that traumatically impact me and most likely led me down this path. Trigger warning, you can skip to the ***. 

I'm a high school drop out, my parents have been seperated since I was 8. My dad told me he wished I was never born. I've made pathetic suicide attempts 2 times. The first time I tried ODing on Tylenol. The second time I planned to go to the train tracks near in my city at night. Left my house without keys at 4am and just walked forever. That was the same night I was sexually assaulted. I was 16 and suicidal, and a man on a bike noticed me walking alone and began following me. At first I tried hiding from him, but in the heat of the moment I just started crying and he found me. He asked me if I was okay and I, being young and vulnerable, told him that I wanted to kill myself. He sat with me for a good maybe 15 minutes talking with me and tried to comfort me. Before I realized, he picked me up and threw me behind a bush and started ripping off my pants. It was raining and I was screaming and kicking for my life. It was the scariest thing that's ever happened to me. I wasn't fully raped, but he did manage to put his muddy fingers up me. I was still screaming and kicking when he was doing all that, eventually he gave up and left me and I just felt ruined by it. I never called the cops out of fear of having to tell them why I was out there at 4am. I stayed at a friends that night.

The following year, I started my first job, met my first abuse ex boyfriend. We met when I was 17, and he was 25. Started dating when I was a year older. When I got my first apartment (paid for myself), he took 8k of my hard earned money to pay off his credit card debt. He made bad decisions and expected me to do the same with him. He gaslighted me, abused me emotionally, I had my own apartment and let him bum there, and because of the labouring job I had, I experienced a miscarriage at 2 weeks of my unknown pregnancy. He called his mom who hated me and told the nurses at the hospital that I was a baby killer, all while laughing about it. He would yell at me and kick me out of my own apartment whenever I would cry about my life. He made me feel like I was just being a big crybaby and that I was too sensitive.  We only dated a year, and a year was enough. I was forced to abandon the property and I spoke with my landlord and superintendent, who understood my position and didn't give me a hard time while I moved back with my mom.

***

I was diagnosed with depression at 17, but I never had any professional help. Partly because I felt as though I could learn to heal on my own, and because therapists are so damn expensive. I think I've been doing gradually better than I did the first few years, but I'm in the current state where I still have to depend on others for support: my mom for housing, my boyfriend for emotional/financial support. They both are okay with this arrangement, but I always feel awful for not being able to be independent. 

My mom pays for the place I stay in with my older sister, who has her own mental problems and I do not get along with her. She has delusions that make it hard to have a conversation with her. It's not just that I don't get along with her, I absolutely hate her. I know she's my sister and that she has untreated mental health problems and that the way she is isn't her fault, but she's violent and cruel to me and I just can't stand living in this house alone with her. It's come to the point where I can't even cook at home anymore and I buy take out everyday with the little money I have. My sister doesn't know how to cook, so she only makes food for herself, or eats whatever food I made and leaving none for me. Talking to her about it is not an option, because she doesn't understand how what she does makes other people feel. She always thinks that everyone in the world is out to get her. Earlier this year I slammed the fridge door out of anger that she ate food that my bf made for me because I wasn't eating and it was my only food. Her response? She shoved the coffee table at me hoping that it would hit me.

My bf and I have talked about how he wants me to be a stay at home wife/mom some day while he handles the finance. I know I have a future with him that we want togethrr, but I just feel so impatient. I want to move on from my life living here. I wanna fast forward to where me and my bf are together in our home and I don't have to worry about anyone else. I hate telling him this because he's the only one out of us making enough money to save for a home. At this point, I just feel like I've been rambling on about things that don't really matter, but its just been hard. Yes, I need professional help, that I will acknowledge. I have so much trauma I need help healing from, and even though my life at this current moment is okay, I just don't feel okay. It always gets better, right?

Anyway, thanks for reading my rant."

I just want to die, I feel like I’ve wasted my youth at the age of 25 and every time I get older all I think it’s another year closer to death. I’ve literally got no one to talk to, every time I try and make some they end up running away from me because they realise how mentally fucked up I am. I’m just a waste of human life who will never be loved, only by his alcohol. 

Sorry if this post is all over the place but my mind is just not thinking straight right now."

So it's all started on September 1st in the evening when I got a call from the neighbour that my mom had an accident. She had injury in her head. Couple stitches. She spent one week in the ICU. She's doing well now but she still has weakness, she can't walk properly. So I had my 4th attempt of my pre-med paper on 12th September and coz of mom's accident I was so disturbed I end up failing it. The exam happens once a year and I've take three consecutive years drop. I would've got selected if I was just stable at that time coz I prepared so fucking hard this time, did everything I could. Two 4 hours library sessions that's 8 hours of daily grind. Also on weekends and in the end I end up messing everything up😓. I'm honestly feel lost.😓. Everything seems like a waste. Me and my brother doing the home chores since then and I've lost 7 kgs in this time. Last week was my birthday and I was feeling so depressed and that's how it's going since then.

Depressed_Shrimp_92,2021-10-26 15:46:50+00:00,hi,"I feel so lonely right now. I'm in my last year of high school, and I feel so overwhelmed. I don't know who to talk to, because there's no one that comes to mind. I have no friends, and I've never really had friends. At the age of 17, I don't think I even know what the word friend or having a friend means. I could make friends if I wanted to, but the thing is I don't like the people I go to school with. Last week, I started to self-harm. I didn't go too deep, but still I hurt my arm using the blade of a razor. I also have suicidal thoughts, and I've been having those for a while. I don't know if I have depression or not, because I haven't had a professional or doctor diagnose me. I want to see a therapist, but the thing is right now my parents are short on money. I just want to die, and I so badly wish that I had the courage to kill myself."
SpecificFragrant4163,2021-10-26 14:54:44+00:00,Most random post,"Im 15, I'm lonely and depressed. I lonely due to social anxiety caused by ptsd. When I hide my feelings around people it makes me feel better. When I sacrifice hiding my feelings for others comfortability, it makes me feel better. I play guitar and I want to make music into a job, I hope to make the world better and through music. It pisses me off how hateful people can be. I have a friend who is nice and encourages me with music I still like him but when I told him I was depressed he went super serious and talked a lot about suicide to make sure if I wouldn't do it I talked to him about some other shit I had been doing and gave me a notebook to write stuff down in and we walked around the school for a while. After being super nice he just acted as if nothing ever happened he started making the same mild racist jokes with other people around me and although he was super nice before I didn't know what to think. Why would someone go so serious about something just to not give fuck later. After seeing how people act how greedy people can be I want to leave be by myself forever and make music to make others happy. I'm not happy in life but I think everyone deserves to be. I wish I had a friend like me though someone who felt the way I did was depressed like me and had social anxiety like me though that way we could live together and understand each other completely. I don't know anybody like that rn but that's what I wish for. There's one other friend I know I consider him my one true friend  because he can always make me feel like I can go on in life when I see his face. I plan to work with him on music, He acts naive and and trusts me too much, he says we'll work together forever, adn do some and start up some shit. But even when i'm in the shittiest mood he's still the happiest person I know."

I'm terrified of telling my mum how I feel because of my brother, I tried to talk to my ex yesterday about it and she just doesn't want to know, I tried talking to my doctor yesterday but nobody is available there until mid way through November.

My partner brushed it off earlier as just another day and I don’t even want to be around him on that day now. 
I feel so unloved by the people I should feel loved by. And even though they say they’ve been depressed and felt like this, they don’t act like it. My partner judges me when I lay in bed for a couple of extra hours on workdays because I cannot get up. I’m not even asleep then but I’m also not awake and that’s somehow more exhausting. I try and try and try to reach out and explain myself and nothing gets better. I feel like I’m stuck and sinking at the same time."
obangarangatang,2021-10-25 23:14:44+00:00,My depression toolbox,"Just wanted to share things that just helped ME through the years and most importantly my latest depressive episode. I was sure I was a goner this time. This is for anyone who is looking for some ideas. Most of this is redundant info one can find by searching the sub or internet. Anyone who feels like quitting, I’m rooting for you to overcome 💪 (These are things that have helped ME, I highly encourage you to seek professional help FIRST) Take what you want, leave what you don’t. I’m not here to debate. Whatever works for you, works. 


- Set bedtime with at least 7 hrs of sleep. Get up when I wake up the first time, unless total sleep is under 7 hrs. 
- Eating every 2-3 hours. Nutritious food. Lots of veggies and fruit. Healthy complex grains. Omega 3s from fish , oil, nuts, and chia seeds. Healthy fats. Anti-inflammatory foods. Lots of protein.
- Exercise. At least once a day some type of physical activity.
- Have something to look forward to each day, if there is nothing to look forward to at least have a task to keep oneself occupied. I’ve returned to things I loved to do as a kid.
- Do a few things in the morning I don’t want to do. Cold showers after morning workout. Cat litter box. 
- Weekly meal prep to save time and make the week easier. Setting time aside for groceries, laundry, meal prep, apartment deep clean.
- Being grateful for physical health. Being grateful for a working vehicle. Grateful to be in a country where I can pretty much do what I want to. Grateful for food to eat. Grateful for clean water. Attitude of gratitude 🙏 
- Purging all unneeded and unwanted possessions and relationships. Simplicity works for me. 
- Meditation and focused breathing when I need to down-regulate.
- Music
- Reading (mostly done at gym between sets)
- Giving to others. Whatever this means to you. 
- Learn to be comfortable with being alone. Codependency is parasitic. 
- Small amounts of shrooms. 
- Removing marijuana, tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol from my life.
- Discontinued use of FB/platforms that have a high chance of being used for self-promotion &amp; ego inflation. People show themselves at their best. 
- Completely removing porn, NSFW, IG suggestible photos. 
- Reducing/quitting masturbation.
- Working on past traumas. 
- Spend time with the innocence of animals and nature. The world and universe are perfect. It’s only because of our awareness, that we perceive things as “bad”. Things just are. Life just is. 
- Limit screen time as much as possible.
- Feeling sad is equally important as feeling happy. Balance is crucial. Learn about emotions. I like the 8 defined by Pia Melody. 
- Apologizing to anyone I feel I may have hurt in any way with no expectation of forgiveness.
- Removing/reducing comparison to others.
- Removing/reducing expectations. 
- Good support system. At least one reliable, caring friend.
- Understanding that every single person is unique, equally special, and inherently worth of love. Everyone goes through a life that we haven’t. Leave the judgement behind. No one is better than/less than anyone else. 
- Everything in moderation.
- Support others reality. They have their own goals, dreams, perspectives. Don’t overshare and don’t manipulate to support your reality. Ask questions. Offer advice when asked for it. Unsolicited advice is most often a form of criticism.
- Forgive and don’t hold grudges. Everyone is trying the best that they know how to.
- Find what success, happiness, and peace mean to YOU. Not societies version. 
- WARNING - Emergency only, skipping sleep for a night gets the brain firing. Not ideal or healthy and can be a dangerous trigger to a psychotic episode. 
- Impermanence is inevitable.
- You’re your own parent now. Treat yourself with love, patience, and understanding. Raise and teach yourself the way you wish you had been.
- Rehab if you can. EMDR and CBT have been very helpful. 
- “Good” and “bad” are concepts and are defined by society. Each culture is different. I encourage you to experience everything you can to expand your mind. I recommend being very careful though, one lives with their decisions (“demons”.)

Apps that help me
-Daylio (comprehensive mood tracker)
-Headspace (meditation)
-Nomo (sobriety/habit clocks)
-MyFitnessPal (calorie/nutrition counter)
-Kindle (So I can read “free” BOOKS through Amazon Prime, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People currently. Def recommend.)

TLDR - The basics are a must for me. Diet, exercise, sleep. Everything else has been learned over the years. Be open-minded, brave, and find what works for you. There is no magical cure. For me, I don’t want to return to my hell, so I’m willing to do almost anything to get better. I HAVE to do the work, the things that are hard, the things that are uncomfortable. Only then will I grow and heal. I  don’t feel the need to explain why I’ve chosen each of the things that are listed. If you want to know why you’ll ask. Best of luck 🤞 Have fun sparring with your ego 💪💙 Oh and if you can, please share your wisdom/perspective 😊"

I'm 23 and being around my mom makes me realize how much of a disappointment i am to her and my entire family. how much they truly are disappointed in me. It makes sense in a lot of ways, i just can't remember a time where things weren't the way they are now. As i speak i'm in a room just typing away and i can just feel the hatred for me throughout the house. i keep asking well what did i do to be hated, but than i just realize that i've done quite a lot of things to be hated for, and tbh it's well deserved, i don't think people hate others for no particular reason.

Im convinced the world has it out for me; any time something good happens life throws something bad at me. For example: I just turned 23 recently, wasnt really excited about it but my parents who split decided to come together and send me enough money to get a new Xbox, I manage to get one ordered a couple weeks ago and it came in a few days ago but instead of charging me when i placed the order weeks ago they charged me when it got here. Im now -800$ in my bank account because i figured they charged it when it was ordered. Stuff like this keeps happening and no matter how much i try and fight and claw my way out of this depression i just keep getting dirt thrown in my face. My mom was diagnosed with Leukimia recently and I cant help but feel like ive failed as a son. I was supposed to be the kid who made it through all 4 years of college and take care of my parents when they got older, I didnt even complete a whole semester of community college... Now I dont even think my moms gonna see me get married because I have no redeeming qualities. I see all these people i went to school with having kids and getting married and Im just now living with roomates. I dont think i wanna live much longer... Maybe try a few new games next year but other than that I dont see any reason to keep going, I guess I just needed to get it off my chest.

This year's been awful, I was sexually harrassed at my work, (for lalamost 9 months), when I got the courage, I wrote to my boss about it, and the people on board tried to blame me.

I felt more lonely and bad about everything. So I counted on my best friend, who somehow knew how to make me feel better, he used to tell me how I was his only friend too.

This passed weekend he got married, and didn't invited me to his wedding. Still, he invited another girl to whom he used to talk to me about how much he hated her, and made her his wife's bridesmaid.

My heart hurts, and I can't help to wonder why."
Throwaway194757292,2021-10-25 15:00:01+00:00,Lonely fat trash.,"Do you know what it’s like to not be able to fit into your work clothes anymore? I can’t work without having a sweater or a jacket on cause I can’t stand the thought of someone looking at my filthy body. I constantly have to pull my jacket down cause I’ve gained so much weight this past year. 

I’m truly pathetic. Just a year ago, I was active, relatively confident and had a major self esteem boost, thanks to my weight loss. I went from 330lbs to 170. I’ve always been overweight since I was a child. So to a FINALLY be skinny, it was a dream. I kept thinking to myself “if only they could see me now!” After the lifetime of torment for my weight. I felt like a I could finally change my life for the better. I could finally do stuff I always wanted to, but never could cause of my weight. 

Ive always wanted to be able to go outside with just a tshirt on. No sweatshirt or hoodie over it.  So when finally did after losing that weight, I felt like breaking down. 24 years alive, and I only just now am starting to feel comfortable in my own skin. It was incredible. 



And here we are now. A year later, and I weight 270lbs again. I’ve always had suicidal thoughts and ideation, but I feel it’s reached it’s apex. I will never be comfortable with my body. I’ll never be able to hold someone I love close. I’ll never have sex.I’ll never be in a relationship. I’ll never be happy. I hate myself more than I can describe. 

Why? Why do I keep going? What’s the point when I KNOW it can’t get any better? This is the proof. It. Only. Gets. Worse.

FriendlyStandstill,2021-10-25 07:36:57+00:00,I’m 21 and I’m already a failure,"Last year I (21M) transferred to a new uni all by myself. It has been nothing but painful. I have been doing horrible in my academics. So bad, that I’m on academic probation at the moment and I don’t think I can dig myself out of it this semester. A lot has occurred this past year and a half. I transferred during COVID summer and it hindered my success of networking. Thanks to quarantine giving me social anxiety. It’s all my fault that I wasn’t strong enough to do better. I let my loneliness and grief beat me. I’m also working two jobs cuz my parents are cutting me off next year. This semester is very unlikely to be successful because I feel the same things at the moment. I have no friends here and the one’s at home are dropping like flies. 

Five of them have died these past two years. I try to befriend my coworkers at my on-campus job, but they don’t care about me. I’m just a guy that they just talk to get through the day. Everybody is close to each other and I’m just the outlier.  I’ve tried and tried to do better. I’m trying to catch up on homework, try to be a better friend, trying to join clubs but I can’t. I’m so busy that I can’t enjoy life. I can’t tell my parents anything, cuz what do they care about my well being. This is what I get for being weak and toxic to people a few years ago.

You can call me a coward for thinking about offing myself but you gotta understand…IM FUCKING TRYING. A coward would’ve stopped trying a long time ago. What do you do when you’ve thought of every other way out? I’m just trying to pick my battles wisely and this might be my last one. 

Although, I will give myself this. I’m the type to go down swinging as well. So I’m going to go all in. If nothing works out by December, it’s the end for me. I’ll just die trying to be remembered. So just in case, it was a pleasure knowing you guys. I pray that you guys are stronger than me."

She know I'm not doing good, but I wanted to talk about it anyway, now I feel selfish talking about this now and kinda feeling that she can think that I want attention (wich doesn't make any sense because she's on my side for almost 13 years).

So I'll tell here, I constantly want to cry, I don't have any good days anymore, just less worse days, I feel like I'm almost falling of a cliff, I'm just holding up there. Sometimes I don't feel like I can pass through this, sometimes I don't know if it worth it.

But you are here. And you don’t care if I feel comforted. You know how upset I am. You heard me crying. You heard me beg. And even though it’s our anniversary and this argument is stupid, you could not care less. All I wanted was to spend time with you or at least go to sleep next to you. I don’t even understand why this is happening. It was a misunderstanding. I wasn’t trying to make you feel bad at all. But why am I so wrong to tell you how I feel. You should care. But you don’t. So why do I.  Tomorrow you’ll say you’re sorry but that’s not how it works. Not when this happens constantly. You hurt me all the time. Act like you don’t care and then you’re just sorry? It doesn’t help or change anything. This is why we fought today . You were sorry and that wasn’t enough to cheer me up so then I’m the bad guy. I wish I could just talk to you. I have no one else."
robynavery,2021-10-25 01:19:55+00:00,Advice please,"So, I've been desperately trying to dig myself out of my depression lately. I've been more forceful with my mental health prescriber to try new meds and alternative treatments. I also started TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) a month ago but haven't really noticed any improvement yet. I'm not giving up as usual and have a couple ideas of what to do when I'm done with the TMS treatments, one of which is Ketamine therapy. I have a couple questions I'm hoping someone here can help me out with. 

First of all I'd love to hear if anyone has any experience with any alternative depression treatments? And if so how I might go about getting involved in them.

Secondly, I've come to the conclusion I desperately need to start making friends again and I have no real idea how to go about that. The only friends I currently have are thousands of miles away and I desperately need human interaction. I've tried a few times to go meet up with people I've met online for RPG games but my anxiety has made it incredibly hard. If anyone has any suggestions I would really appreciate it."

At least I have my cat and my guitar. Although the comfort those things bring is only temporary. I have many material things to keep me company, but emotionally I'm exhausted. No one is here and it kills me inside."

If only i had taken care of myself, provided more resistance on my way here then it could’ve been prevented. Too late now, its here. Thats what people probably mean by self pity. I just don’t want to play the role required to be “healthy”. Taking care of myself feels like a betrayal. Reaching out to people and needing support that i could never give to others myself. Honestly makes me feel like a leach. How many times can i do that? 3, 10, maybe 20 times before i force their hand and leaving me becomes an act of self preservation. The pattern repeats enough times and you realize this is your reality. Either we leave quickly or endure a slow grueling fight labeled “recovery”. Ultimately it doesn’t matter. 

It’s so stupid watching your death go from tragedy to an inconvenience. Maybe thats why i want the former, to give a grandiose ending to an otherwise mundane wretched life.

I’m attribute it to my exhausted looking face and especially under-eye bags, on days when I couldn’t sleep well (despite sleeping for 12 hrs even). 

It feels so unnatural and depressing, that i cant even enjoy a happy moment, given that its so uncommon for me to have such moments in life. 

Does anyone else feel this way? That our depression is kinda self-feeding and growing in itself, despite us trying to stay in a neutral state?"

I’ve been battling a cocaine addiction for years in the past (I finally got clean two years ago and have been clean ever since). After I stopped doing constant drugs and not eating, I gained quite a lot of weight but not enough to make me morbidly obese or unhealthy. My boyfriend has been with me before and after this happened so he’s seen the difference in me. He preferred me thinner and don’t get me wrong there’s nothing wrong with that, I just wish he wouldn’t be so embarrassed of me in front of his friends. He even told me that sometimes he doesn’t want to be seen with me in public when I wear skirts or dresses because of how my legs look…

My mother tells me about how badly I need to lose weight, my sister constantly makes jokes about how I’m fat in front of other people and my brothers never fail to remind me by saying things like “if you’d just lose weight you’d be so pretty”. I just feel like im at a constant pressure to be something im not. I’m not unhealthy and I actually prefer being like this, but the constant pressure of never being enough for anybody has been wearing me down over the past two years. I wish I could be perfect for somebody like this, or not perfect but I wish they’d just understand that I’m happy now and not just always focus on the bad. I kicked a very hard and scary addiction, and instead of support and happiness all I get is “now you have to do this And you’ll be perfect”. 

I don’t know how much longer I can stand living like this. It probably sounds like I’m being over dramatic but it’s hard, sometimes its very hard. Anyway I just wanted to get it off my chest, if you’ve read this far thank you, I appreciate you &lt;3"

The thing is, these past few days it feels like I've forgotten to take my meds even when I know I have.

My head feels ""fuzzy"" (not sure how else to describe it), I'm lethargic, and generally apathetic. I have no interest in anything, feel chronically bored, and just want to sleep all the time so I don't have to deal with being awake.

I know that this should be temporary, and things will improve as my body adjusts to the new meds, but I just want to know how others might deal with these feelings, and ways for me to potentially feel better at least for a little bit while I wait out this change."

Specific-Environment,2021-10-22 13:22:29+00:00,I need help? [rant] [ED/depression],"3 years ago I completed therapy for an ED with which I had been struggling for over 4 years. I was happy... until I wasn't.  Turns out all I managed to do is get rid of some coping mechanisms (ED) and develop depression instead. I stopped going out, talking to people, bailed on school despite it being my final year. Since there wasn't any specific behaviour concerning food (apart from eating sh""it and actually gaining weight) no one really cared. After a few months like this, I decided to get my life together. Steadily started engaging in ''life'' again. I didn't go to therapy again as I didn't want to alert anyone knowing how much I have already put them through. Since that time I managed to maintain my depression ''under control'' as in even if I'm really miserable I'm still able to complete the basic tasks. Recently, however, maybe because of the Autumn/winter or maybe because of an overwhelming amount of pressure I'm under (2-year medical undergrad + part-time job + living alone in a foreign country) or perhaps my mind can't deal with it anymore. I've grown enough to know I NEED HELP but I've got no idea what could actually help me. I have no friends, no money/time for therapy and I just can't anymore... I don't expect anyone to actually respond I think I just needed to put some of my thoughts together

""Is there a thing called a 20 year old crisis?"" YES. Eventually you will get to the point where you have to focus on a career and you don't know which one, you are scared that whatever you do leads to nowhere. Also there is probably going to be a point when you will be disappointed by someone and you will have do rebuild your trust in humanity, that can be a relationship or a friendship. Usually that person would be someone you projected something on that would be a replacement for your family home since you start going more into the world and searching to build a home yourself. But that is normal, it usually takes a few shots until you find the right person to do that with. At some point you will also experience a lot of setbacks. In school everything worked out for you, you had good grades, you got far. Now you have your college degree and no-one hires you. They don't want you. You go through a phase of really bad self esteem until you learn to be less affected by this stuff. Maintaining friendships will be harder the more you get into your 20s. Everyone starts having families? Great jobs? Moving everywhere in the world? At some point you will wonder if you have any friends left. (But you have, you just need to stop being too shy to get in contact). The worst thing is, that at some point you will not believe that anyone feels like you do, because everyone seems so happy and content, successful in job and relationship and just everything and you will be really scared to open your mouth and say ""Hey actually everything is kinda shitty right now for me."" because you get intimidated SO MUCH. But once you do, you will see that everyone feels like you do. And you will be able to talk about these experiences and bond with your fellow 20somethings. And you will find ways out of the situations that are shitty and you will be so proud and learn so much about yourself. It's shit, but it's great."
dragnilar,2021-10-22 05:36:04+00:00,Post Concussion Depression - Any Suggestions On Dealing With It?,"About two months ago (beginning of September), I had a sleep walking accident and it left me with a mild concussion. I went to the ER for it and they said there wasn't much they could do besides prescribe Tylenol and something else for nausea. Went home and felt extremely tired and mostly flat and emotionless for about 2-3 weeks. After about the fourth week, I started having episodes of depression. They started with dreams about former lovers and then other depressive thoughts started occurring.

I tried dealing with it by myself for a while but it ended up getting worse and I ended up doing a couple foolish things (trying to reach out to ex lovers just to talk) and ended up getting the same results that lead to our break ups. So that didn't help. I am pretty sure that wasn't wise.

I will note that I have been dealing with depression and anxiety all my life and I am now taking Effexor and blood thinners. However the medications are really not helping. I was also taking Welbutrin (XR) prior to the incident, but my doctor took me off of that until I get a sleep test since it correlated with the sleep walking starting (it was also causing constipation, which I don't miss). My doctor did raise the Effexor to hopefully get me through until the sleep test is done.

Anyways, it has been almost 2 months since I stopped taking Welbutrin and I am also still having some symptoms from the concussion, namely the depression. The depression's getting pretty crippling too (lack of motivation, sleeping more often, preoccupied with lots of gloomy, unpleasant thoughts, feeling overly sensitive to things that would normally not phase me). If anyone has any suggestions on what could be done to help with this, I'd appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR - I hit my head about 2 months ago and now am experiencing depression that is ebbing from mild to worse. Medications that normally work are not helping me very well. Any advice?**"

I’ve realized how lonely I am. It’s funny watching how as you grow older your friend circle shrinks, which makes sense, and it isn’t always a bad thing. A few close friends is all you need. But when it gets to just such depressing numbers… idk. 
Like they can’t even hang out with me after school because of conflict with our families. 
I’m going to be spending my 18th birthday alone in around a month. I mean sure I’ll have my family, like my mom and dad, but they rarely talk to me, and I quite frankly no longer have an interest in talking to them.

I don’t know what to do. I’m so alone."

Jaded_Ad6272,2021-10-22 03:23:42+00:00,Visiting my parents post breakup and I can’t find any joy or happiness,"I want to feel happy, even for a moment. I want to laugh at something or find something interesting and/or exciting. I had that a few weeks ago hanging out with friends but here with my parents I’m just all in my feelings. I need to leave but I’m about to start a life on my own and I’m so anxious it has me disconnecting from those desires too. My community of people are 2k miles away."

smith_and_jones4ever,2021-10-22 01:51:01+00:00,Everything seems meaningless,"It's probably just where I'm at in life but I get the impression that nothing matters anymore. Not just for me but for all of humanity. Everything is becoming cheap and meaningless. No one really cares about anyone else and we're all trying to be rock stars or artists but no one ever listens to anyone else's music or buys each other's art. 

It's all just wasted potential rotting on a free sample tray. I feel like an idiot. I've worked really hard for my entire life to be a good musician and I'm finally recording my own songs. But I signed with a label who's CEO is now dodging my texts. I'm getting fat and developing serious health problems. My siblings disrespect me to the extreme. None of my friends growing up were ever actually my friends. 

I don't feel as bad as I should about it. I hate people anyway, we're all just trash bags trying not to spill. Who gives a shit about who anybody is anyway? I also have a stalker that followed me from the previous state I lived in. Why would someone that used to be a friend do that? I'm fairly certain they want to kill me. Why is everything turning into shit? And why do people enjoy the idea of that happening?"

I always remember everyone else’s birthdays, but nobody remembers mine except my parents or siblings. It kinda sucks but at the same time I feel like I shouldn’t need the validation from others to be happy. The past few years, my birthday has always sucked whether it was because my parents had an argument or nothing went right for me in general. I don’t really know what to do and I just don’t want to cry this year on my birthday and I don’t want to be sad. Depression sucks man"

And that part was right. 9 years I will never get back and the worst part is it’s all my fault because I let it go on so long. Even after I finally left I still said we could be friends, that I wanted him to find happiness even if it wasn’t with me, that I would always support him and be there for him. What’s wrong with me. I’m so tired. I want to hate him , I want to be angry for all the time I was there for him when he had nothing, when his self esteem was in the dirt, all the times I lifted him up and encouraged him to keep going. And for what, to be constantly compared to women that don’t even know he exists. I will always be worthless to him. I am so tired. But he will be happy to know that it’s finally happened, instead of being too full of emotion, of all these feelings, now I’m just like him incapable of feeling anything. I am numb and I am tired."

abupatata,2021-10-21 23:30:21+00:00,Depression doesn't stop,"Life is fucking strange and depressing.  You would think everything would workout  but it never really does.

Growing up as the kid that was most adored in a massive family and the cool kid that was best at a sport, girls are always attracted but I'm always to hesitant cuz I'm too depressed to even approach them. U would think life should be fun in that position but it was never really all that. I was always feeling fucking down for no reason And i was depressed 99% of the time. It triggered even worse when my parents divorced  and which till to this day has a very strong effect. I shut out everything I had even quit the sport which could have taken me to the pros and fucked up all grades and I couldn't talk to anybody bout it. All I though was killing myself but I can not get myself to do it.

I got lucky to study abroad for many years studying something that is highly recognized but even then I dropped out due to my depression. I cannot get myself to see a therapist for Watever reason. Got in amazing shape didn't work. I did all the partying, drinking, sex, drugs but nothing worked. Relationships didn't help, partners cannot get me to snap out of it,
Loving family can not do anything bout it even though I don't talk or show it around them. Toxic relationship till now is making myself very suicidal but I feel like I'm stuck each day .Is there something fucked up in my brain that can never be changed ?"

I’ve hit rock bottom before. Severe depression, multiple institutions, disrespectful, drug use. Basically a piece of shit. I like to think that I’ve turned my life around. I am attending online college and I get straight As. I work out everyday. i’ve reconnected with my parents. 

However, i still lack any sort of positive outlook on my future or life in general. I desperately want to feel excited and pumped when i wake up, but instead i wonder what’s the point. I neither have any friends nor a girlfriend. I recently got on Bumble but all it has done was lower my self-esteem. I fear that i lack the social skills to ever connect with anyone again.

I do have some goals, but my motivation and hope is diminishing every day. I’ve never posted on Reddit before so this feels like a desperate move. I’m open to any and all wisdom, advice, etc."
cherubseverywhere,2021-10-21 15:29:11+00:00,A poem about relapse,"Back to pills like they never left. 
Less sleep more nightmares and cold sweats. 
Waking up with a sore stomach, filled with regret and emptiness. 
Stumble out of bed, my legs hurt, why?
It must’ve been the tablets I took last night. 
And to my demise, I peel back my shorts and slowly realise what I did with my pocket knife. 
Everyday. 
Same routine with the same expressionless face,
Are you okay? You look a little thin. 
I’m fine, don’t worry, I’m great! 
My backs to the wall, the shadows are crawling under my door. 
I see their hands, I hear them calling, I’m shouting and screaming to leave my thoughts. 
Life is hard but it’s harder without you. 
And every night, I stare to the moon hoping you are too.
I know you’re not, but that’s fine. 
I still like to imagine it from time time. 
The headache of life persists to a migraine,
I relief myself knowing I have packets of you in my drawer to alleviate this pain."

houjous,2021-10-21 05:27:46+00:00,isn't it ironic,venting your emotions are suppose to make you feel better overall - so why is it that when ever I say anything to others I get more isolated??? It's because of their stupid faces. you see their faces drop - their eyes become a bit more dark around the eye bags and their eyes either glaze over to try to ignore your desperate calls for companionship and support or they become glassy and you know you hit a sensitive spot and put them into a version of depression aswell. Their voice go up an octave or two to sound supportive and non-threating while to me it just sounds like they are mocking me. It also tends to isolate more because i realize my thoughts are not kosher compared to the normalcy of the average joe. did you know most people dont experience depression??? its like a once and a while thing when something really bad happens. For me it's been constant for over 10 years. Trying to explain how you live to a normy makes it very easy to understand - we live in 2 very different worlds. my only accomplishment is that i've survived for this long...the only other people who think like this is people outliving the death date of their deaths and people escaping from war-torn countries. While depression sounds like the best out of the 3 given - i would choose either over depression. atleast then there is a reason why things aren't turning out right...depression is an invisible force that no one really respects. so to most people im just a lazy bum not mentally crippled. (im also crippled physically)

I plan to just take my ciprolax in the morning since I've missed a lot of nights and have a lot left. I have a shit ton of work for uni, projects and midterms all closing in on me. I feel so fucking stupid and drained.


My dreams have been making me sad too. Dreamt about my deadbeat alcoholic father who can't make it out of addiction, my old cat, who I miss everyday, (it's been a while since I dreamt of her)  who we left when we moved to get away from my dad, and just old shitty people who used to mean a lot to me but hurt me repeatedly. And my old home that's now a wreck of what it used to be, I always go back there in my dreams.


I've been sleeping too much after not sleeping enough. Missing class, not up with them anymore, reminded of how fucking dumb I am now from how smart I was before depression got me. I'm thinking about how my family has hurt me, how they showed no remorse for what they did. Just ignore it and act like it never happened. But I still love them of course!! I wouldn't feel lonely if I wasn't hurt as much as I am. But life is life.

Which is annoying because when it happens it's easy to remember that they just weren't meant to be around but it's hard to feel that level acceptance. I guess it helps if you have a solid group of friends to fall back on but even then there's something essential about being with someone intimately. People think love doesn't exist or it's lame but I think it's a primal instinct to be in a relationship involving mutual, true love. Although it doesn't seem to matter in my case. Women just use me and then get way shitty. It's terrible, especially when everyone I know is married. There's some kind of conspiracy going on here. There's a secret branch of the government dedicated to cock blocking people like me so we die bitter and alone. Or ""live"" that way, if that's what you want to call it. It's more like waiting than living though. Much like an abandoned dog tied to a post in the snow except no one gives a shit no matter how many weird, sad noises you make at them."

Rackintosh,2021-10-20 11:32:52+00:00,I wish I had the natural inclination and energy to look up the information and side effects to each new medication I get put on.,"Which has been many over my long history of piss-poor mental health—more than most, seemingly. Just... research, like some people I have come across online and in people personally within my life. It could help to identify sensations and potential problems and allow me to go to bat for myself more clearly, confidently, and easily, rather than putting all of the faith, stock and responsibility into one psychiatrist to ask the right questions, deduce correctly, and snuff out what might be going in a short time frame—to basically be excellent and fantastic at their job.   


Or maybe not. Still... I wish I had this—the natural, innate ability to research. Not even in regards to just mental health, but... anything. Anything really at all. It's never be a part of me, never been able to learn it and just do it. Always unnatural. It's one of the many facts that I've learned over the course of my life, about myself personally, that makes me feel inadequate as a person overall.

Pretty_Round943,2021-10-20 03:43:00+00:00,I have a bad self worht,For at least the past 7 years I’ve always believed anyone could do better as me than I do. I feel like that is pretty common but lately I’ve gotten into these mind sets of wether my girlfriend would care or notice if I disappear or die. We live together but I haven’t felt like she cares too much cause of how she interacts with me and forgets our plans and plans over them. I don’t like the idea of manipulating anyone and just don’t know what to do. I feel like I may actually kill myself if I hit a little too low of a low. I also think she wouldn’t care all that much. I feel like I’m number 10 in her priorities. My mindset is super toxic and self destructive but if I share them I’m afraid of it hurting others so I try to keep it to myself. Anyone know what to do or think?
guygoingthroughlife,2021-10-20 02:26:31+00:00,I appreciate anyone who takes their time to read this I need help ❤️,"Where do I begin. 
Firstly, to anyone that reads this, thank you. This is something I barely do. As my life progresses I’ve realised a few things - mainly I’m a mess. I can no longer pretend everything in life is going to mysteriously fall into place or simply the idea that soon everything is going to be ‘alright’. Let’s get right into it. Truth is I’ve never really known what I want from ‘life’ or what I’ve been doing with my life for the majority of it. For example. Although this cannot possibly summarise the depths of what I’m trying to explain. Some people want to be doctors. They work hard and become doctors. Essentially, there is a clear goal. My problem is during my time in school even up to university I just did things ‘because’. 

‘because’ that’s how it is. You’re expected to get good grades and make your parents proud. I wanted to do well to keep my parents happy - and to keep them off my back. So I did the bare minimum to do so. I got good grades. Got into a good university but somewhere along the lines everything began to catch up to me. Long-story short I dropped out of university. I tired to blame a issue at home for my main reason of leaving but truth is I slowly became disconnected with was I was learning and everything had just became a chore. Unlike being in school - you don’t get into trouble for not attending classes. In university if you miss deadlines or have poor attendance for classes/lectures there’s no ‘real’ sort of repercussions -  I started smoking weed heavily in university and do think it may have worsened my feelings of disconnect or disengagement but a few things became clear to me: if I had some sort group project or work -  I would always go above and beyond - not for my sake, I know how important others value their degrees/courses and I never want to be the cause for anyone’s misfortunes so I always pulled my weight. Then it occurred to me - I was still doing things just to do them. Just to ‘keep up’. Just to ‘appear normal’. Just to act as if I’m getting on. Same as exams -  I always wanted to pass exams to avoid the feeling of failure - the exclusion felt from when you don’t pass or do to well. Knowing that I’m on the same steady pace as everybody else. In other words ‘Safe’. 
I can even apply this to sex. I had literally forced myself to have sex when I turned 20. Just so friends could stop asking me whether I was a virgin or not - the experience, I wouldn’t even call  ‘sex’ nor ‘enjoyable’. I took a viagra pill and met this girl I had been speaking too. She claimed ‘it went in’ in my brain, meaning virginity lost, I left it there - I realised yet again I’m just doing this ‘because’. 

After this encounter I never even tried to have sex with this girl again - it was like I had just checked something off my check list. Thinking back on this situation - it was embarrassing. She probably told her friends how bad my d*** game was but I was so oblivious at the time I never even thought this way. 
Essentially I did something just ‘because’ again.
Not cause I want too but ‘because’ where I’m from and the friends I had being a virgin at 20 is ‘embarrassing’ or not the ‘norm’. I remember being present at places where my friends had lost their virginity way younger than I did. I never really understood it. Maybe I was overthinking it and should just ‘crush pus’ like my other friends do - I had my own fair amount opportunities to lose my virginity even before I had turned 20 but just never felt the ‘need’ to have sex. So never did. I literally never pulled through whenever it really got down to business which made me question - why did I even speak to girls? Guess what. Just ‘because’ again. ‘Because’ my friends did it. ‘Because’ if you didn’t - you’re considered weird or gay. I remember I would literally rather watch porn than have sex with a girl I have no real care for or she has no real care for me but I’m waffling off topic I hope this all just builds understanding for the ‘just because’ explanation I’m trying to give.


When I dropped out - I had returned home without knowledge to a terrible situation regarding my parents. My parents have never been together. It’s the typical story of a broken family. Abuse. Dysfunction etc. You get the point. I could get into details but would probably need to make a entirely different post. 
The main impact from this situation was that I was told a lot of things that were supposedly ‘hidden’ from me - I guess for my ‘protection’ . I was told my father used to abuse my mother. Which he denied. He never wanted me. He disowned my sister. Essentially it became a game of he said / she said. I had lived with both parents separately in the past -  on and off but such situation immensely destroyed my trust in anyone. I mean hearing my father never wanted me yet spending years living under his roof, eating his meals etc made me question whether it was ever love or something he just had to do. Unfortunately, as I grow older even if it was love or something he just had to do I understand it now. My mother is weak. I hate to admit but she’s one of those people that are too good for the world. Overly Innocent. Too Kind. Vulnerable. Weak. My dad had claimed she had her own problems but as a boy, your mother is always your loving mother you don’t question anything until you grow up. The hardest thing for me to fathom was I started seeing each of their points about each other.  The fact that my mother was a broken woman battling mental health problems for the majority of her life. Then my father who they claimed never aimed to raise a family. I have a older sister and things didn’t go well with my father and her so I guess everything started ‘making sense’.

In university, my dad didn’t visit me once - we rarely spoke but I had noticed our relationship becoming more than non-existent. I don’t exactly know why. I mean I got into the best university I could have (Top 10-20 in my country at the time)  and had never really let him ‘down’. He had got married and kind of forgotten about me and it seemed like I was just permanently stuck with my mother. 
Please don’t think I hate my mum but as mentioned she was unstable I sadly only remember her more for her worse moments as it is what I can recall the most seeing. 
But anyways. 
Here’s the real problem:

After dropping out. I had the house to myself I’d say for about a good few months (only because my mother had fallen ill again due to her mental illnesses so I had the place to myself as in that state it wouldn’t be healthy for her to be around me) This is where everything had caught up to me. I became insanely lonely to the point I had forgotten how to socialise - I would meet up with  old friends (people I’ve known for years) and barely could think of sentences or keep conversations flowing but did so just ‘because’ I wanted to appear like everything was fine. Not only this. Me being alone for so long I started to dislike being around anyone. As I said my mother was unstable -  she could be smiling one day and crying the next so I had to always suppress myself or keep a ‘guard’ up. She would always pretend things were okay even when they weren’t. I smoked weed almost everyday couldn’t give you a WEEK where I went sober. I hadn’t seen most of my  friends since I dropped out (year and a bit) and it just seemed everyone had forgotten about me. Phone was dry. Only here and there people would check up on me but then it all stopped. You would of thought having a free house to myself I would constantly have friends over or even host a party but truth is I was just drowning in depression. 
I’ve been drowning in depression my whole life - I’ve only realised my feelings of depression when I began university and properly had alone time - I realised I don’t have any real connections or relationships with anyone. Never had an Ex and my friends we always were in groups which meant we never had to get too personal we were always just kind of in the moment.

The time I spent at home was during the Corona period (which is still going on?) The effects of my isolation began to creep up on me. I always had the blind shuts. My health was poor. Would barely wash or brush my teeth - take any care of myself unless I had to - had to meet a friend or had to do something where I had to look somewhat presentable -  when I went out. I realised how overly paranoid I look always questioning ‘do I look normal’  am I ‘blending in’ yet I never used to think this way before. One day I had noticed I usually start conversations with myself - a person on the train had caught me and I always went into a panic as I didn’t even realise I was doing such thing so blatantly  - it got to the point I would pretend to be on the phone to just ‘act’ like I’m talking to someone.

As a kid or a teenager if I had told you I was doing things like this no one would believe me as I never acted this way. I must add I lost a lot of hair during a young age and underwent surgery at a fairly young age too. I can’t say the surgery went too well but during the process of the surgery and my recovery my life became even worse. it was summer, scorching hot. Obviously with the surgery my hair looked crazy. I had hair in my bald spots uneven to the rest of my natural hair. For a long time I felt I had to stay indoors and ‘hide’ away until this issue cleared - months and months passed and I soon started living the exact same day everyday. I felt I couldn’t go out as my hair was uneven - I couldn’t even bring myself to go to a barber shop in public nor take a walk or even just let my hair out I knew how bad this was for my recovery but a voice in my head wouldn’t let me free. Try to understand from my perspective at a time in life my hair was bad but i could accept it -  I could go out with my hair out, confident - then it got to a point I couldn’t - then I got surgery and had hair where I didn’t but didn’t know how to act as I never had hair there before. Do you understand? Also where I’m from it’s absolutely unheard of to do things like this - I had to essentially keep this a secret - I didn’t tell anyone - I missed a lot of holidays, birthdays etc simply due to the fact I wasn’t comfortable in my own skin and when people asked for reasonings I couldn’t share the real reason as I was scared of being judged. 
But yet again I didn’t understand myself - why did I do this if even if the results were successful or not how would I go about it? It seems my whole life I had made decision without my heart fully wanting those decisions to be made. 
I wanted my hair back so I could look like everyone else ‘because’ everyone else had hair. I was like the only guy with hair problems in my entire school. People noticed early I was balding but yet again going off topic.

How do I bounce back?
Please don’t tell me to start going gym every day.  
Start a business and make 4-5 figures in 6 months. Not that these are bad things.

But right now I feel like an alien. I need to rebuild myself essentially restart life. 
Is there any films I can watch? Any books I can read? Any podcasts I can listen too. Any music that will reach me? 

I just need help. What do I do. If anyone read all of this. What is Step 1 for me?"

VeryMentallyStable,2021-10-20 00:50:01+00:00,My scars have already ruined every relationship I’ll ever have,"Don’t even know why I’m thinking about this. I don’t even want a girlfriend. I already know that. I only like the *idea* of having one, not the real thing. So I don’t know why this is bothering me right now, but it is. I’m covered in self-harm scars. They’re all up my right arm, across my chest and stomach, my thigh, even up and down my back. There’s no angle you could look at me from and not see a scar. 

I’ve heard all the “they’re not ugly” and the “they’re part of who you are” and “if you meet the right person, they won’t judge you over them”, but honestly I think it’s bullshit. At least partially. Because people might try to believe that stuff on the surface, that’s what they might think consciously when they see them, but there’s a subconscious reaction that I think is impossible to avoid. 

Now I’m not the type of person who normally gives two shits what other people think of me. Live my life alone, so people mean next to nothing to me in general. But one thing I really hate I when I feel like people see me as weak. And that’s why my scars frustrate me so much, how to hell could I ever let anyone see them and not have them think of me as weak on some level after that? I don’t think they could help it, subconsciously, if they saw that I’ve self-harmed before and saw how much, it’s kinda unavoidable to see that person as vulnerable, fragile, weaker than they were before. I don’t think you can avoid seeing someone differently after seeing that. 

You hear it in people’s reactions all the time, it’s always something like “I’m sorry”, it’s sympathy. I don’t want it, don’t have any use for sympathy. Don’t want someone to feel “sorry” for me. But I can’t avoid that reaction. Even if they say nothing, I’ve seen it in their eyes before, back when I still forced myself to be around people and had casual encounters. I saw them look and there’s always this same reaction, even if they say nothing about it. It makes me wanna call the whole thing off and kick them outta my fucking house. I hate it.

I’ve never experienced it in an actual relationship before, but I don’t think I ever could anyway. Like I said at the start, I don’t even want one, so I don’t know why I’m caught thinking about this but I am. It just makes me so fucking angry that I’m stuck with these for the rest of my life, that my skin will never be smooth ever again, that even if I somehow found a way to tolerate people and maybe actually wanted a girlfriend, that I couldn’t have one now because I already know what she’ll think of me when she sees the scars."
Deadeye1200,2021-10-19 20:34:00+00:00,Don’t know what to do anymore,So I’m 23 years old and recently I have been thinking of nothing but killing myself for the last week and a half. I feel like I’m not worth anyone’s time and effort. Everyone around me has someone that they’d rather talk to than me I’m just everyone’s last choice and the only way my friends talk to me is if they’re bored it feels like. I feel so alone all the time. I feel pathetic cuz I’m 23 and I’ve never been in a relationship and all of a sudden everyone had someone and I was just left to the side by everyone. I just don’t feel I’m worth anything to anyone they’d probably all be better off without me and would forget about me if I was gone. Im so tired of feeling this way I am tempted everyday to end things im getting to my breaking point.

AutisticBalistic,2021-10-19 19:27:28+00:00,I just need to vent.,"Im a 17 yo guy. I've been mostly to myself all of my life, and got targeted by a group of older students in most of primary school. The bullying was mainly targeted at my looks, and it left mental scars to this day.
I was never one of the cool kids, despite being quite good friends with some of them. I've got absolutely no self confidence because of this, and I still find it very hard to this day to look people in the eyes, or even talk to them.
About a year ago now, I got my first ever girlfriend, and that was essentially because she was making all the first moves. She convinced me to ask her if she wanted to date, and she originally declined, just to accept less than a day later. Then things started going well. I was actually happy for the first time in my life, but like all things seem to do, it all went downhill from there. She started completely ignoring me. I knew the break up was coming and It broke me. Its the first time I've cried in my life, and its about all I did, for a week straight, before we eventually broke up. It even got to a point where I was sitting in the shower, crying with a knife at my throat, but I couldn't go through with it, because I didn't want to hurt my family. She kept trying to keep in touch with me, and I kept giving in, just to eventually hurt myself even more and block her again. This borderline mental self harm luckily ended a few months ago, but it went on for longer than it should have. I've since then found out that she was never even interested in me, and just wanted to get closer to her ex again (one of my best friends). When she found out that wasn't going to work, I just became a distraction for her, until she eventually got bored of me, and is now dating some other guy.
Ever since things have been about the same for me. I feel empty, cold and without all energy. I have no motivation what so ever, and procrastinate constantly, and its ruining my grades. I haven't felt any joy or happiness in over a year, even when buying myself things I really wanted, or good things happening to me. Im scared to talk to anyone about it, because my sister was diagnosed with depression at around my age, and all the help she got was pills, and got locked up in a psychiatric ward for almost 3 years. And I don't want that for myself. I've seen how that broke my parents, and I don't want them to go through that again, but I really don't know how much of this I can still take.
And I'm not sure if its just me not wanting to accept it, but I don't think im depressed, I don't think I need help. And yet im here writing this."
thymenf,2021-10-19 18:49:54+00:00,I don't know what to do anymore,"I am so stupid, I keep giving my heart to girl's just for them to break it dude
I also just hate my life, I don't wanna live here, I am from the Netherlands by the way and me and my family moved to Sweden but I don't feel good here at all. I have thought about running away countless times but I don't have the ball to do it. And I don't want to make my parents sad but I do feel like I already have made them sad because I keep saying they are stupid for moving here but deep inside my heart I know they did it because they thought it was the best. They obviously can't look into the future and know I wouldn't like it here. So maybe I'm the problem, maybe I am causing all the fights we have in our family. Because I keep being ungrateful even though I'm really grateful for everything I have, I really am but I just can't be happy. I love my family but no matter what fun thing we do, even though I'm smiling deep inside I am just not happy at all. I keep thinking of the past which I probably shouldn't but I still do. I fucking hate my life and there's nothing I can do. I used to be so happy when training football for example but now I can't find joy anywhere anymore. It really sucks because I used to be such a happy boy and now I am a depressed teenager that doesn't want to do anything. Everything sucks but it also doesn't, I don't really know how to describe it because I have loving and caring parents but I still feel messed up. And this is not some kinda suicide note, don't worry I won't kill myself although I have definitely thought about it but I don't have the balls for that either. And don't hit me up with the ""oh it's going to be okay"" or ""you'll be happy at one point"" like no the fuck I'm not I will never be happy. Also I have really thought about buying weed because I really wanna get high and listen to Lil Peep, I feel like that would make me happy but the bad thing bout that is that I will only be happy when high and then I will get addicted. So I really don't have a way to be happy right now. And it really sucks.
I just wanna be happy dude. I really don't know what to do."
CompetitiveExchange3,2021-10-19 18:23:55+00:00,25M I have lost everything in my life and my life is a tragedy.,"Where do I even begin with? My career is in complete ruins, my family is in ruins, my physical health and confidence is in ruins, my mental health is in ruins, my finances are 0, my social life is in ruins, my zest for life is 0!

Will start off with my career; I'm from India and I graduated in Computer Science Engineering in Aug 2018 and moved to Canada for my post grad with so many dreams and expectations of living in one of the most peaceful and beautiful countries on the planet, only for my mental health issues to shatter it all and all my dreams came crashing down. I had severe anxiety issues in Aug 2019 and returned back to India without completing my postgrad and losing a significant part of our family savings and with a huge career gap. 
So, I worked on my mental health, took counseling, psychiatric medication, took to yoga, meditation and made a remarkable recovery.
I then applied to universities in Ireland and miraculously got my study visa approved despite my Canadian visa being still valid and moved to Ireland in Sept 2020.
I thought my life was back on track and I looked forward to making a career in the EU, but alas, Covid-19 restrictions ruined everything. Ireland had one of the toughest lockdowns in the world and that once again had a debilitating affect on my mental health due to which I did not have any friends or anybody to talk to and it was so lonely and gloomy I decided to return back to India in March 2021 but I was so upset that I couldn't continue my postgrad program (which was fully online). This resulted in me dropping out of two masters programs on two different continents which has left me with a gaping 3 year career gap and my family finances practically all exhausted.

As for my family, I lost my beloved mum to Cancer in March 2020 and my family is in a very fragile state. My elder  brother (30 y.o) has a load of mental health issues to deal with and his career never really took off and he is unemployed for the past 6 months. He has no zest for life, no maturity, no social life, no direction in life and constantly keeps asking my dad why my parents gave birth to him as he can't handle life anymore. He spends the whole day sleeping or browsing his laptop while my dad is at work working for his livelihood. 
Speaking of my dad, he is close to retirement and he will be retiring next year. He has an on/off slip disc issue which leaves him bed ridden pretty often. He is close to 60 and he is only growing older by the day and I can't even bear to imagine what will be our state once he becomes senile. He is the only reason I am even living and I feel so very insecure at this stage, our family is walking on very thin ice currently and it looks like it's only going to get worse from here.

My physical health has been a roller coaster ride in the past 5 years. I was always pretty overweight and this ballooned into obesity in 2016. I was a 105kg with 40% Body fat percentage and my confidence was at an all time low and I experienced mild forms of bullying in my undergrad university. I started working out and dieting over the next two years and I had a transformation where I reached 70kg in 2018 and was at peak physical fitness and confidence.
But my mental health issues since returning from Canada in 2019 meant I became obese again and went back to 102kg by Jan 2020. I hit the gym once again (I took to boxing this time) and after my mum's passing, covid restrictions hit, so I continued working out from home and by September 2020, I was back to peak physical fitness by the time I moved to Ireland and I improved my fitness a few notches more after moving to Ireland and my confidence was back to an all time high (especially since I was into boxing) . 
But life wasn't going to go easy on me and since I returned back from Ireland in March 2021 due to Covid-19 restrictions , I put on weight again and I'm now pretty back to square one, where I was originally in 2016.
My confidence is 0. I don't step out of my house, I don't make eye contact with the neighbors, even when I do step out, I try to keep a low profile as I don't want any friends recognizing me and noticing I have put on weight again. I literally hide in my room all the time. I feel ashamed and embarrassed for something that isn't necessarily my fault.

With regards to my mental health, I feel so mentally incapacitated and heart broken right now. I feel very heart broken that two attempts at moving abroad for a better quality of life were extinguished even before I could even start living my life in two beautiful countries. The metaphorical plane crash landed even before it took off. It hurts so bad I can actually feel the pain manifesting itself in my chest. I'm also very mentally incapacitated, I can't seem to remember anything, my cognitive abilities have taken a nosedive, I feel like my I.Q has dropped several notches, I can't seem to get basic tasks accomplished anymore! I feel so despondent and helpless! :(

I'm not financially independent since I don't have a job, I don't earn a single cent, my unsuccessful stints in Canada and Ireland cost my family $60,000 USD in expenses, we don't have much left, I depend on my dad for all expenses and I feel so ashamed and embarrassed I want to bury my face into the ground like a freaking ostrich!

All my socials, my insta, FB, Twitter, WhatsApp, Snapchat are off as I obviously feel very heartbroken that everyone else is living their life to the max while I'm at rock bottom. I am not in touch with any of my friends, I've never had a girlfriend and I feel like I can't even socialize anymore and maintain a half decent conversation with people! I feel so inferior and inadequate whenever I interact with anyone. I haven't even met anyone outside of my family since my return from Ireland! 
I am scared to even use LinkedIn anymore because all my peers are so far ahead of me career wise it kills me that my career is so badly messed up! I feel like hanging my head in shame. No employer will be willing to hire me as I have such a big career gap (they are very particular about not having career gaps in India), this apart from the fact that I'm so mentally incapacitated that I can't even accomplish any tasks assigned to me and I am currently not employable in any form. The train has completely derailed and I'm a complete train wreck at the moment! :(

I'm so clueless and directionless in life. I just browse reddit and youtube all day, I sleep at 4:30-5:00 Am and wake up at 1:30pm everyday. I am literally living under a rock right now and I feel so insecure and scared as to how fragile my family situation is (my brother's situation really worries me). I am so mentally incapacitated I can't even get basic things done, I don't remember anything, my memory betrays me, I feel so despondent and heartbroken. I have no clue what to do anymore. I have contemplated suicide often but I want to live for my dad and do something useful for him while he's still alive. I feel so lost and helpless, I wish the apocalypse would happen right now! I'm so heartbroken and empty. I can't do this anymore!

I thought life would be a movie with a fairy tale ending but it has ended up being a heartbreaking tragedy! :("

Safe_Relief_7375,2021-10-19 17:28:20+00:00,I've decided to try to express my depression into art,"I just joined and I'll tell you a little bit of my story. I fell deeply in love with a her girl in a time of my life where I wasnt searching for love. We had such a connection and when we hung out it was magic. Unfortunately, I had to go away for school, and before I left we both promised that we should wait for each other. One of those, ""right person wrong time"" things. I'm a division two football player and I have a love/hate relationship with the sport. Recently, I lost the love I had for it and it just isn't the same at the college level. I cut off a lot of friends to get to the best football school I could. I still have some lovely people in my life, but we don't talk as much. So, I was struggling with those problems, but I still had this girl. We were friends, and I even asked if we were still waiting for the future, to which she said yes. She posted a heart necklace and said she loved it, and I noticed she wore it all the time. It has her birthstone in it, and it's a beautiful piece work of art. It's really similar to one I got her. But, she never buys jewelry for herself. At this moment I began to realize maybe she had moved on, but was afraid to tell me. I was too afraid to ask. About 3 weeks later we'll say, before the biggest game of my season, she snaps me pictures of her cuddling with another guy. I lost my temper and told her to get out of my life and stay out. Ever since then I'm unmotivated, unhappy whenever I'm not playing football. Just at really low spot. Suicide has crossed my mind, but I wont don't it. I cant bring that burden upon my mom, dad, and sister. So, in trying to find a healthy way to express myself, ive turned to poetry. Messages to those who have had positive impacts on my life, something they can read in my voice. I want them to be secrets for right now, I only want them to reach those people if something happens to me. My dramatic self also have given them vague titles but with information only me and the reciever would understand. Stuff that can be interpreted by anyone and it conveys meaning, but the true message is my friend. This has also helped me see the good in this world, by forcing myself to think about what I appreciate. Anyway, thanks for reading if you did :)"

Normal-Necessary-679,2021-10-19 13:44:57+00:00,How the sensitivity and the sensations in the lips and glans determinate our behavior.,"I know what you are going to read may sound crazy I put it out this information for whatever person that think it can be useful , Im working on a book with all of this and more psicological subjects, but I dont have enough time to work on it right now so for the moment im going to put out some of it. Thanks and sorry for my english Im not a native speaker.
The lips and the glans are the most sensitive parts in our body and that sensations made interferance with our thinking and acting. The skin of the lips is the same kind as the glans, like this ones,the lips are a erotic zone, when we have sex this are the two parts where we focus the most. In our normal life we use the lips to express every emotion, its important to say as this is an erotic zone just the feeling of the lips moving when your are talking or when they are touching each other when we have our mouth close (upper lip and down lip) give us this sensations that can also not be too strong or can escape to our consciousness they made an interference with our thinking and acting process. When you are talking to somebody people tend to look to other places, left and right be or to the floor from time to time or if you try with someone to look at each other faces without talking, you will see somebody always looks away to other place. This is like you are trying to hide something, you dont like people to watch to your lips in an unconscious way, is where you express the emotions and where you feel this sensations of erotism, you feel naked in this situations because as the glans it is a naked part of our bodys with a special skin to feel pleasure, its like showing your thinkings to other even if you dont say anything. Freud said that the paranoia cames from the sensations of the asshole and the penis, for me he forgot the lips. Also the sensations in the glans made interferance with the thinking but primarly the lips are the ones who stimulate more the glans, thats why when we speak to somebody we start to feeling sensations in the glans, in that situation we always save one hand in our pockets while talking,try to look next time with somebody when you talk(only males do this). Jewish people and musulmans practice circumsicion because of this subject to prevent the glans sensations made interferance with the act of thinking and acting, they have other reasons in religion but I think this is the principal cause. Theres also a study that talks about neuoronal reorganization throught circumcision. Losing sensitivity in the lips and the glans makes that this sensations do not made interferance with your thinking or acting. You can lose sensitivity in the glans with circumcision but also you can put the glans out of the foreskin doing your daily tasks, but also the foreskin is a very sensitive part of the body, and you can lose sensitivity in the lips rubbing them with a towel. Any questions I will be happy to respond :D."

VeryMentallyStable,2021-10-19 11:43:27+00:00,I just want to sever my need for connection,"I was built wrong. I know people say humans are social creatures, that human connection is an inherent need for us. But I was put together in a way that means I *can’t* connect to other people. Or I’ve been moulded but life to end up like this. Either way, the result’s the same, I’ve got a need I can never fulfil. It’s like I’m dying of thirst but water is poison to me. I just want to find the part of my brain that thinks it needs connection can cut it out, like a cancer.

I don’t just want to be alone, I *need* to be alone. I can’t be around people anymore. If I have to keep doing it, it’s going to make me kill myself. It’s already pushed me to that point before, even if I did fuck it up. I don’t know what to do. It’s not even about it being a human need, it’s inescapable. How can I have a job if I can’t be around people at all? I can’t even support myself. So my choices are either stave to death because I can’t participate and it leaves me penniless, or kill myself because I don’t have the mental bandwidth to deal with people. 

Every experience I’ve had with people has been awful. There’s none of it I’m grateful for, none of it I can look back on and feel any positive emotions at all about. It’s all just hate and anger and rage and loneliness. My parents are garbage people. I still have to live with one of them because I lose all my jobs, but I hate her with every fibre of my being. 

I don’t have friends. I never have. I don’t really understand the concept, at least as it applies to me. Feels like something I just can’t do. I don’t care about people. I don’t want to stay in contact with people, or hang out with them, or listen to them talk to me about shit I don’t care about. I don’t connect with them. They only make me feel more alone. 

I can’t have relationships. I used to think I was incapable at feeling love at all. Turns out that wasn’t entirely true, I was at least capable at one point, because I fell in love with a girl, the only real friend I’ve ever had. But she didn’t feel the same way. Among other things, it killed the friendship. Probably for the best, I was mostly blind at that point, had rose-tinted glasses so thick I couldn’t see the world with her. Once they were shattered I saw that’s she’s just like everyone else. Selfish. Juvenile. Disappointing. I don’t think I can feel love anymore after that. Think the illusion has been shattered. Not to mention it’s not worth the bullshit that rides shotgun.

I just don’t understand how I can have piles of evidence stacked to the roof about all the reasons I hate the entire race, have so much of it my brain is simply incapable of forming connections with people because it knows how garbage we all are, and yet there’s still a part of me that feels the need to torture me with loneliness. It’s infuriating. My skin aches with touch-deprivation, it permeates down to my bones. I’d constantly fantasise about just feeling a simple hug. I hold onto a pillow every night while I sleep, imagining it’s a person, even though I know damn well I don’t want anyone to take it’s place, that I’d sooner slit someone’s throat then let them into my bed. So I don’t understand why the need won’t just fuck off already."

I can't help but overthink its me somehow, how she might not want me anymore, and I'm terrified of going back to being alone again.

Rapper257813,2021-10-19 04:51:32+00:00,In all seriousness. Am I depressed?,"I am a 30-year old man, I have a job and do well. I live with my beatiful wife and her beatiful kid. I get to vacation and take a break every now and then (not as often as I'd like to. Maybe once a year). I don't feel overwhelmed by issues or anything like it. 

However, for some reason I always feel bothered. Annoyed, angry. Is either that or just inexplicably sad, quiet, and not in a mood for anything (nothing). I see myself day-dreaming more often lately and can barely focus at work, or hold a conversation with anyone without wanting to be alone. 
I feel uninspired, unmotivated and only do things because I HAVE to. I act like I'm okay, I act like a happy person so others around me don't question me.

Smoking weed has helped a little in a way but is not really helping me see what's the root cause of it all. Plus, being high all the time is not the answer either.

Does this sound relatable? Am I depressed and just don't know it or don't know how to identify it?"

In the last few (let’s say 3-6) months she begun speaking to a new guy whom she hid the true identity. She disguised him as her cousin and they were only friends. She knew the guy had a crush on her and yet continued to speak to him behind my back?

Yet fast forward a 9 months after our break up, me and my ex meet again on social media. She told me that she had had two rebounds after me, the second one being the “cousin” that I mentioned… who was of course not in fact her cousin.

We’ve been speaking again for about 3 months now and it seems we are both potentially looking at getting back together. But I cannot get over the fact that she lied to me, as well as dating that guy. I’m really depressed about it and the thought keeps on ringing in my head everyday. I don’t know what to do."

bkores,2021-10-18 18:04:39+00:00,Depression+anxiety success story!,"After years of struggling with depression and anxiety both of them are pretty much gone! Here's how I got to this point:

Started off with 5mg of lexapro for about a month. Improved my anxiety a little but made me extremely unenergetic and apathetic.

Psychiatrist added 150mg of Wellbutrin to help with my energy and mood. It did help a good amount, but it made my anxiety worse and gave me insane brain fog.

Psychiatrists upped my lexapro dose to 10mg to counteract the side effects of the Wellbutrin. This did the trick. The lexapro lowered my anxiety, while the wellbutrin lowered my depression and improved my mood and energy, without the brain fog. But my anxiety and depression were still not where I wanted them to be.

So I started taking Vitamin D daily because I'm somewhat deficient and fish oil since I read that it can increase the effectiveness of antidepressants, and it has been magical. I feel fucking fantastic! As an added bonus, my cognition is much better and my lower back pain is pretty much gone thanks to the fish oil!"
gfm3dx,2021-10-18 18:00:09+00:00,Why we push away loved ones,"It follows me around, always just out of sight, but I know it is there and ready to strike when I am at my weakest. It only takes an instant. It manifests as some sort of large, heavy, abhorrent demon sitting on my chest, making it hard to breathe. All I manage are shallow, little breaths, and each of them hurts physically. I can move my hands or feet, but not my body. I am trapped. The weight is so heavy I cannot lift it. One thing I have never heard anyone else describe is how it spreads through my body, with the chest at its center. I litterally feel it tingling all over my skin, from my chest outward, to my toes and tips of my fingers. It feels like the darkness is consuming me, spreading its rot through my veins until all of me is infested. 

&amp;#x200B;

And there I abide, in this oily, barely breathable, all-encompassing void of nothingness and hopelessness. There is nothing I can do against it. When it happens at night, in my room, I try to numb it with a bottle of red wine and weed. I found this to be effective, just like applying ointment to my numeris (the bleeding wounds I scratch again and again because of my dermatitis) before i step into the shower. Warm water hurts, but less if the wounds are covered in grease. The drugs take the biting edge of the darkness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot see beyond the darkness when I am trapped there. Forming rational thoughts or connecting to the real world is nearly impossible, for it forces me to let my guard down and then the darkness starts playing tricks behind my back. It will talk to me, mock me, embarrass me:

&amp;#x200B;

'*What are you trying to do? You think you can concentrate on helping her? How worthless can you be, do you think you can just turn your back on me? That I would just vanish when you try to take your mind elsewhere? You will pay a price for this. I will destroy you, and I will drive her away.*

*Why are you still trying? It is pointless. You are pointless. Weak. Drunk, stoned, mindless, cursed by the darkness. You wrote it down in your book, but you never acted upon it. Let me remind you of your words...*

&amp;#x200B;

*""I could not be selfish again. I had no right to keep her close just to ease my loneliness. It was mine and I had to battle it myself. I had to keep the dark cotton I was drifting in together, let no one, not even her, pluck at it to find what’s underneath. I had to protect her world from myself, hinder the corruption from within me to infect the innocence of her soul. Only I could keep this void full of madness from spilling over, into her. Over her. Consuming her. Hurting her. ""*

&amp;#x200B;

*And look what happened! What a surprise! You let the curse spread to her, you almost slapped her face with it! I hope you are happy with yourself now.*

*You thought it was just some sort of self-therapy session? Laughable. If your relationship is destroyed, it is your fault. You knew that all you had to do is send her away, but you didn't. You brought the curse to this place, and it spreads, hungry, ravenous, clawing its way into all the things you love.'*

&amp;#x200B;

When I was young, I was afraid of this place, but not any longer. Whenever it decides to drag me down into the maelstrom, I smile, close my eyes and dive in head first. There is no escape, no help, no salvation, so I found it is easier to submit and stare it in the eye.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I go to war with myself, and I mock the things hiding in the darkness, dare them to come at me, show their ugly faces. I have learned they are nothing but my fears, and they cannot hurt me beyond the almost pathetic emotional pain they drown me in. It didn't think I could take the pain, but I could, and still can. It gets a little easier with experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bring it on, dear darkness, we are not done yet. You never reckoned I would just soak you up and force you to become a part of me. I will never surrender. We will wage war forever. We are not done. 

We are done when the blood on your sword is the blood of your host."

VeryMentallyStable,2021-10-18 13:38:08+00:00,How do you reconcile feeling like you’re a hundred different people and no one all at once?,"I feel like I’ve got a thousand different faces. I feel like I’m too many people all crammed inside the same head. I don’t even know which one is “me”, if any of them are. I feel like I don’t actually have a personality, I’m just a compilation of other people on shuffle so it looks like a person. Or at least some Frankenstein-esk approximation of one. 

To be clear, I don’t think I have DID or any kind of split personality thing going on. It’s hard to explain. I guess the best way to describe it is like Bumblebee in the Transformers movies, how his voice was just radio snippets all pieced together. He was still one entity, had one voice that was always “him”, but it wasn’t *his* voice. Ever. It was always hundreds of other people mashed together to fit the situation. That’s more what I feel like. 

I know some people think it’s all useless pseudo-science or whatever, but I’ve tried doing the MBTI test a bunch to try and get some sense of self, some idea of maybe what I’m supposed to look like. I did more than take the test, actually, I studied the hell out of it trying to learn about the cognitive functions and everything so that I actually felt confident in the result. And I think I am. Almost every time I’ve done the test, it says I’m an ENTP. I’ve studied the functions, and I feel pretty secure in saying I’d agree with that. Reading those things, maybe it didn’t pin down how I act externally, because how could it when that changes minute to minute, but it definitely seems to describe the internal workings of my brain flawlessly. I relate to it a lot.

But knowing that doesn’t really mean anything. I think, if anything, it just threw another spanner into the works, because it’s just one more “me” in my head that thinks I should act a certain way. And maybe it’s the most *me* me. Or maybe it isn’t. I have no idea how to tell. 

The problem I’m having right now is that all the “personalities” (don’t necessarily think that’s the best word for them, but I can’t think of another one) think they’re “me”. And I guess in some way they all are. But they’re also mostly wildly different from each other, so they conflict. Like I said, according to that test, I’m an ENTP, so extroverted, generally high energy, a little chaotic, funny (at least to some people), kind of eccentric, that type of person. And when I see other ENTPs in media or something, I see a lot of myself in them, enough that I almost feels like it “awakens” something in me that makes me think “that’s me, that’s how I’m supposed to act and when I do act like that, I feel like myself”. But then sometimes I just don’t have it in me to be like that. Sometimes I go almost completely silent. In that state right now. Averaging about 5 spoken words per day right now. When I do talk, it’s short, cold and dripping with venom. And I think to myself “this is me, I can’t maintain the ENTP shit, so this is what I default to, so this must be who I really am and that must be the act”. 

There’s others in there too, with their own ideas and everything, but these are probably the best examples as they’re polar opposites. But it changes everything about me. It changes how I feel like I need to dress, the words I use, how much I swear, how I structure sentences, whether I drink like a complete alcoholic or whether I’m completely sober. There’s no consistency. I don’t even know when it’s going to change or what causes it, it feels like it comes out of nowhere. Can happen in under a minute and go back within the hour sometimes. Sometimes it’ll last for months, like right now. Been practically mute since August.

I’ve gotten to the point where I actively try to fight the changes when they seem like they’re coming, which is hard since it’s hard to tell. Usually much easier to fight the impulse to go into extrovert mode though, so I tend to keep myself in silent mode. I crush the urge to talk when I arises, not that I have anyone to talk to anymore. I deleted all my social media and blocked all the numbers in my phone. No one outside of my house can contact me and I wouldn’t consider anyone a friend or anything anyway. I live with my mum and her husband but they’re both garbage people so I avoid them wherever possible. Used to live alone but I can’t hold down jobs cause of all my issues so I can’t afford to anymore.

I don’t even really care which “me” it is anymore, I just want to feel like I identify with an actual personality and be able to stick to it, to have some kind of consistency, to be at the point where two different people who met me on two different days would have wildly different descriptions of me. I want to stop having the constant feeling that I’m in conflict with myself because it’s not what the “other me” would’ve done. But I don’t know how to do that. I’ve brought it up in therapy, to multiple different therapists but I can’t get an answer on how to do that, or how to integrate the personalities or whatever the hell it is you’re supposed to do to become a whole person."

LifeBytes123,2021-10-18 11:14:59+00:00,Therapy for my gender dysphoria doesn't work for me.,"What is there to do when therapy just doesn't work? Been seeing a therapist since May for severe gender dysphoria and it just doesn't work.  


Background: I am a male who despises the male sex and hates being male. I find every aspect of being a male disgusting, including but not limited to the anatomy (main problem), the gender roles, the perception of men in today's society (being a female, while I am sure has its problems, is much more advantageous than being a male in my opinion), etc.   


The therapist has suggested/asked my thoughts on...  


\- Transitioning/hormonal therapy. I have ruled this out because I find scarring extremely unattractive and I would not want to be in a body that I found to be unattractive. There would be zero confidence in myself and my looks. It also would take way too long and way too much money to fully transition and while I respect other's prerogatives to transition and kudos to them if it helps with their gender dysphoria, just not being a biological female still doesn't sit right with me. I went through puberty as a male and it just feels wrong from a personal perspective. I also would not look good as a female imo due to my bone and physical stature. I'd actually be shooting myself in the foot and killing my already very low chances of dating drastically. From what I heard, transitioning would make it even harder to date the desired sex that you'd want to date.   


\- Wearing clothing belonging to the opposite sex. I ruled this out because I find the male body disgusting and ugly and the thought of putting such a repulsive thing inside women's clothing makes me cringe. Penis' and testicles are just gross to me. Facial, chest, arm and leg hair is just as disgusting to me. Basically, any aspect of being a male and living inside one's body is. I already do something similar and that is basically put all of my social media profile pictures as attractive females (celebrities) and I still feel awkward and disgusting doing it (because of the biological assigned sex that I am). The reason I do this is because I have nothing better to put as my pfps and I'm not putting my disgusting self as a pfp.   


\- Living vicariously through other people. Sounds really weird/creepy, and would likely just make me feel just as bad/even more jealous of those that I cannot be.   


Over the last week, the depression has manifested itself so bad that I have lost any and all interest in my hobbies, I have not left the house except on very rare occasions and when I do I wear a mask and hat at all times (even when not required) to hide what I look like because I am ashamed of being a male. Since the depression festered in May, the amount I'd take walks for greatly reduced (used to walk every day for 3 hours at a time to the point where I was at almost 200 LBS during the peak of my exercising, and now I am pushing about 300 LBS in weight as of this post, and incidentally, I am not bothered by it. I now, as mentioned before, don't leave my house. I sit on the computer all day skimming facebook/twitter and take naps periodically. 

&amp;#x200B;

I find there no point in working on a body I hate, because skinny or fat, jacked or not, I find the male body disgusting and hate being born a male. I am extremely jealous of attractive people of the opposite sex and to the point where their message about body positivity aggravates me. Like ofc you can preach about body positivity. There's nothing negative about the way you look. Try being me for 5 minutes of your life. My eating habits are terrible. I eat a lot of junk food daily. At one time, I ate half of a box of ice cream sandwiches because fuck it, that's why. As you can tell, I have pretty much given up on my life and I don't wish to exist. I have constant thoughts of suicide, but will not attempt it because I do not have a foolproof way to do it. If I was to make an attempt, I want to get it right, so all I can do is wait for natural causes to take me out.   


Basically, I feel stuck in life and want out, but I cannot be gifted that mercy. Yeah, I am stuck and don't know what to do..."

I want to die. I'm hallow and I have no spark. Please someone see me. Please someone make my life worth living."

Why do my brain keeps obsessing over them and thinking of random scenarios all the time???
i might need to ghost or leave them first. Again. 

also tried to focus on something to get out of the endless loop so decided to take a bunch of classes. but i suck at them. im so slow my brain feels heavy and i cant comprehend what the f im reading. i feel like im taking up someones space and air

and why im i so fat? im so aware of every cellulite morsel on my flimsy body and i wish i could use that energy for something else.

Holding this in I don't know how long I'll last...but if I say anything ill destroy my family....the only reason why im still hanging in there. can't say anything to a therapist they are super sensitive about that type of stuff and here who knows who's tracking data.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  i give up. I wont die, but im set on not going anywhere other than doctors till my parents kick me out...then i have no reason at all to stay in this realm."

Sospicywithaddytude,2021-10-18 03:21:18+00:00,Feeling useless.,"I’ve dealt with depression for years and it’s been manageable with an antidepressant. Until this year. I don’t make enough to pay bills. Can’t get a better job because I don’t have higher education. I can’t go to school because I can’t afford it. 2020 was supposed to be the best year for my husband and I but shortly after we bought our first home, he lost his just job and we’ve been in a hole since. I try to have hope and be strong and I am trying so hard. I work so hard and I feel like it gets me nowhere. I hate it. I hate this. I hate myself. I hate feeling completely useless. I often find myself asking why I’m even trying anymore and thinking that my loved ones lives are better off without me. I hate feeling this dark. There’s so much pain and I don’t want it to hurt anymore."
AdMiserable1232,2021-10-18 03:11:27+00:00,Any depression resources?,"I’ve been struggling for a while. I’m just not sure where to go from here. 

My medication that my doctor has prescribed aren’t working for me and I’ve been going to therapy. I just feel empty and almost numb to any emotions other than sadness and anger all the time. 

I want to feel better, I hate feeling like this. I just want to feel happier again, I know it will take time but I want to get help. 

Does anyone here have any suggestions for how I could start to feel better? I’m open to try anything I can.

Thank you in advance."

My truck I see now is gonna be a money pit my girlfriend broke up with me and got another bf in about 2 days but she still talks to me and says she loves me so I can't get over her I have classes with her too so I still see her daily 

Some friends of mine cut me off entirely for litterally nothing they just stopped talking to me. My escape was video games for a while but they feel repetitive and slow lately my back has felt like shit for the past month. The new friends I've met don't even want to talk or hang out outside of school i was invited to a party on the 30th but idk if I even want to go now because I know half the people won't want me there. 

I know probably around 300 people in person as friends and I can't talk to any of them about this because they think my life is great because my parents are still together but they work so much I don't get to see them often so none of em will care i just don't know what to do anymore some days I lie on my floor and play music for hours until someone gets home but even then we don't have much to talk about"

VeryMentallyStable,2021-10-18 01:17:26+00:00,Why is all the “help” so useless?,"I’m at the point where I really don’t think actual help even exists. None of the “help” is helpful. I’ve been on at least 10-15 different medications and none of them did anything at all. Nothing. Been to therapy for over two years now, changed therapists a couple times too. I don’t even see how therapy is *supposed* to help. Feels like if you’re even halfway self-aware and self-analytical, there’s nothing they can really do for you. If you know why you do the things you do and feel the way you feel but can’t change it or make yourself feel something different or see the world differently, then it feels like they just throw their hands up and don’t know what to do. 

I can explain and articulate things pretty well, know why I’m in doing the things is do and I’ve even been “congratulated” about that before, like it makes any difference to me. And so when I don’t need someone to help me process, don’t need someone to help me unwrap myself or put things into words, then I guess therapy has nothing to offer me. Talking about things doesn’t help either, just in a pure venting sense. It actually makes me feel worse. And they’ve proven to me at this point those are the only things they can offer. Apart from the same old useless things like journaling or meditation or mindfulness or something, all of which I’ve tried but don’t do a fucking thing no matter how long I stick to them.

It’s even the same on here, when I make posts like this. Don’t even know why I’m making this one, to be honest. Feels like the definition of insanity. I appreciate what people on here try to do, I guess, but it feels like every comment fits into one of very few categories, none of which help. It’s either someone saying they feel the same, which doesn’t change anything for me, or it’s someone with some positive bullshit about how you gotta “enjoy the little things” or some equally vague suggestion that usually contains zero actionable advice whatsoever, or it’s someone suggesting something I’ve either already tried like exercise or medication, sometimes things that I even said I’d tried in the post itself, and they just didn’t even read it, or something that isn’t an option to me for some reason, like ketamine or psilocybin therapy. I get that people are just trying to help or whatever, and I’m not trying to be an asshole on purpose, but it’s just frustrating I see the same thing over and over again and to get to the point where you’re just stuck wanting to throw something cause every comment you read just feels so useless. 

It’s so fucking demoralising, I don’t even really see the point of trying to get “help” anymore. Feels like every time I do, it only ends up reaffirming that there’s nothing anyone can do, that the idea of getting “help” for this is mostly bullshit, and that I’m gonna feel this way forever, so I might as well just kill myself cause I don’t even know what “better” looks like for me at this point, let alone see a path to actually get there."
KunalRedditing,2021-10-18 01:02:11+00:00,I just want to end my sufferings.,"If you would've asked me some months ago on how to suffer a heartbreak, I'd have told you that atleast you've got a life, you get to eat food, you get to have so many beautiful things others won't, and would've scolded the shit Outta you. But fucking experiencing it I'd have never thought it would be so hurtful. 

We were perfect, she was perfect, I know it's not the end of the world, but it somehow still is the end for me. Nothing really feels right and I just can't focus on anything. How the fuck does someone deal with heartbreak, HOW. I've heard 100 suggestions and things from people to do and I've tried everything but at the end I just feel like ending every bit of presense. I might sound like a whiny lover who can't deal with heartbreak but trust me, I was not like this. I never expected this. I just don't even know what to do with myself anymore."

Depressed-Emma,2021-10-18 00:33:43+00:00,Good at hurting people,"First sorry for my English and sorry that I keep jumping between my problems in what i wrote.
I hate myself.I am not a likable person no matter how hard I try.I am 23 never had a best friend. although I listen to my friends every time they have problems and try hard to be nice but I am always that kind of friend that is easily forgotten.There was only one person that seemed to like me that I treated badly and she left me. can't blame her but I always have this guilty feeling with myself because of how I treated her.To be honest I was always an angry and stubborn person I used to treat my Family bad as well until perhaps a year ago I realized that they were the only people that cared about me despite knowing what bad behaviour I had. but there is one problem.Since then I decided to put my family first and make it up to them but I am horrible and I can't.I still lose my temper sometimes and when I think about it I feel like I only ruined their life.For 22 years i treated them badly. I chose a major that they didn't like. A major that i have come to dislike.Only because I was stubborn then.And i want to immigrate in a few years.We live in a very bad country and I know that both my parents like to immigrate too but they are too old now and its all my fault.When I was a little younger whenever I asked my father why we don't immigrate he would say we are waiting for you to finish your studies.I don't think he knew about immigration laws and I didn't then as well but the important part is that now they can't and its all my fault.I feel so guilty.I am going to live without having done anything for them and only hurting them.And today when I told my father I want to immigrate to this country he asked if there is a way for them to come and I laughed and told them you can't go anywhere and nowhere accepts you.It broke his heart obviously and I regretted it immediately but it was too late.I don't know why I keep doing this.I keep hurting people who love me and i feel like I really am better off dead.I feel so sad for things I did and there is not a day that passes by without me crying over and over again."

1throw4,2021-10-17 22:28:26+00:00,How to assert a passive aggressive colleagues,"My colleague is confrontational. Passive aggressive. Very aggressive. And the joker of the team. 

She won't say things directly and always gaslights. People laugh at what she says

They've known each other over 10 years. 

Some of her comments about other people are derogatory... 
She says it in her thick accent to come across funny but she isn't joking. And I am the only person who don't laugh on cue to her which I believe is what's the problem. 

Things she says about me to someone else while I'm there are 'she is dumb isn't she '

'shut up Virgin Mary'

'what you smiling at you never smile '

'you will get diabetes you will get diabetes'..as I'm non responsive.. Then ' Indians are likely to get  diabetes '

I usually just ignore her. If I respond it would be unprofessional. 

I don't want it to get to me slinging around insults and I'm proud that I haven't because in a non professional setting I would. 


I recently responded to her telling me to get a life when she said she never heard of some people in the tabloids, I blurted out 'it's pasts your age group'

Then she was highly offended are confronted me about it and we went back and forth.. 

She comes across misogynistic and doesn't like woman and ethnic woman much.. 


I wouldn't want to be like this. It's not my style TBH. I don't want to be painted the ugly angry person."

But lately I've started a job and just find my life so boring. I get up and goto work, there isn't exactly progression in my career so I don't have many goals there. I come home and watch TV. I have a boyfriend and a nice flat. But I'm so bored , I feel like I'm not really alive.

I try and plan things to look forward to, like holidays , trips and I try to give myself big goals like getting married or buying a house but ALL of it seems boring and pointless. When I'm on holiday I just wait around for it to end and that is not like me at all.

watermoonn,2021-10-17 21:20:56+00:00,i’m sorry mom,"this will be my last post for a while and i feel like i have to get it out of my chest because i’ve had it in my mind for some days by now. 
i’m sorry for my mom, deeply. i’m sorry because she’s been through so much in her life and she still suffers from it. instead of being able to help her i just worsen the situation. i’m sorry that on top of it all, she has to handle a depressed daughter. i’m sorry that she has to do it by herself because my dad doesn’t even notice us. 

she doesn’t take me to therapy, and i think she doesn’t fully know what goes inside my mind but i know she is aware of how i feel. she doesn’t know how to approach it, it’s hard for her and i understand because she has problems of her own and an on and off depression too. 
i told her a couple days ago that i didn’t want anyone coming to my house on my bday (because i found out some “friends” will surprise me) and seeing the disappointed look on her face was what made me cry. she told me i just can’t continue in my grief stage forever, and that i have to try and get better and stop being so lonely... but i really can’t. i wish i could do it for her, show her that i appreciate what she says but even the slightest thing such as seeing some of my old friends makes me sad, anxious and as i told her i don’t really feel ready to see people. i feel very fragile.

even though i don’t have the best relationship with my mom i’m sorry, because my mom doesn’t deserve this, she deserves way better in many things but i wish i could help by not being a burden and such an annoying depressed daughter."

I have pills I've been saving up, ibuprofen I feel like dying everyday. life isn't worth it. Life is lonely and all I have is myself. I've been with a therapist she was a nice lady. But my depression stems from my evironment and there not much I can do to change that evironment. I want to give up. But I can't not in front of family even though I hate them so much they don't deserve to see me like this. Not much my family or friend's can do about it either the whole family is depressesed talking to them won't help. And I did before and they said was we can't do anything about it.

Awkward-Yard6121,2021-10-17 16:28:28+00:00,Need advice urgently,"So, I've been thinking about changing schools and going to a private school away from my home.

I've made a lot of bad memories in my home town e.g with toxic friends. 

When I was in elementary school two friends of mine would randomly start ignoring me, then, after a few weeks they'd start acting normal again. 

Then there was a friend of mine who ghosted me. Now another (I'll call them A) ended our friendship a few days ago. I've been struggling with depression for many years so I know I probably triggered them. Still, I'm hurt.

I still see the two of them in school and I can't stand it. All the memories I made with them come back up and make me feel like shit. 

Seeing A makes me feel the worst. I thought they were my soulmate. I could tell them anything and they were the first person in my life I trusted and loved so much. 

I don't want to feel that way anymore. I want to start all over somewhere else. Somewhere where no one knows me and no one knows about my background.

I'm not so sure quiet yet though. Should I do it?"

VeryMentallyStable,2021-10-17 12:55:04+00:00,How do you see the point?,"Is there even a point to any of this? I just don’t get it. Am I just supposed to wake up, try to fill in time as much as possible until I can finally go back to sleep over and over again every single day for X number of years until I die? Why bother? I’m fucking bored…

I know people say you just gotta enjoy little things and shit, but I don’t really enjoy anything. I try other stuff. I do things that at least pass the time faster. But I don’t enjoy any of it. It’s just better than staring at a wall, I guess. Feel like I’m constantly just checking the time until it’s late enough that I can sleep all the way through the night and hopefully sleep in a late as possible the next day. And if I think too hard about how tomorrow’s just gonna be the same exact thing, I don’t wanna wake up at all. If it’s all just killing time, which it is for me at this point, sleep beats everything. 

Doesn’t matter where I go or what I do, I just feel like I’m just trying to pass time until I die, and it’s never going fast enough. It just crawls past at a fucking snails pace. It’s demoralising. I guess I just don’t wanna be alive. Don’t enjoy it at all. No part of it. Tried to take medication and go to therapy cause I guess that’s what people say you should do when you don’t wanna live anymore, but none of it helps at all. Been on about 10-15 different medications over the past 2 years, not one of them did anything at all. Nothing. Been in therapy over that whole period too. Doesn’t help at all. Seen multiple therapists too, same thing with all of them. Don’t even see how it’s supposed to help, honestly.

Back with another therapist again now. Didn’t really want to go. Don’t much see the point. But I can’t work feeling like I do and I can’t get welfare unless I can prove I’m getting “treatment”. She was asking me what I’m hoping to get outta it and I don’t even know what to say. Don’t know what it even is I’m hoping to get better, can’t just pick a thing. It’s everything. Feel like I’d need a whole new brain to change how I feel. And even if I could identify some specific issue I want her to help with, what the hell could she do about it? Talk at me? I just don’t see the point of therapy. Don’t see the point of anything. So fucking bored of being here."

I've struggled with depression before, but this time I really don't see anything in the future that could change how I feel. I miss my ex, my old friends, basically my old life that I will **never get back**.

I don't know what I could do to make this better. Any ideas?"

johanslacker,2021-10-17 01:39:42+00:00,"Most people aren't good people, just neutral.","I've come to realize normal, common people probably self-perceive them as being good people. Since most of them won't actively harm or try to take advantage of another person. Yet we know so many things in the world are wrong without doing any single thing... people in my country are dying of hunger in some of the most secluded locations, products that we buy are made with materials that were adquired from impoverished countries by pennies, ensamblated by modern-day slaves in countries like China... yet none of us will do a single thing to avoid or change. Thus we're not good, we're just neutral and as long as none of that shit will touch us no one will do anything at all. We just outsourced slavery and patted ourselves in the back about how moraly superior we are to our ancestors.

And not even I feel complied to do anything about this. It's been like this as long as mankind has existed. Anything I'd do would be pointless and even myself would like to be a normal person. Goodness requires above everything else self-sacrifice. And even if someone is sacrificing some money to donate to charity, some time to recycle trash, some work to avoid wasting resources I feel unless it's entirely devoided of the need of comfort isn't enough. We all have a limit to how much we're willing to sacrifice to help another person even if we could do so.

And it hurts me to think about this. I can't stop thinking I could just sell all of my things and do so, but I won't. There's a part of me that is satisfied with all that suffering as long as I can get comfort for myself. All of my future plans are made with the sole purpose of trying to improve only my own current status."
abdelboua1,2021-10-17 01:23:07+00:00,I've distanced myself from everyone.,"I don't know what to say tbh, I've been through so much pain during my whole my life, from as far as I can remember I've always been alone, I've never had real friends, most of my life I've tried to be that funny person, who will talk to anyone about anything, always trying to smile, make them laugh and help them out in anything they struggled with, but at the end of the day, I lifted them up while they never saw me as anything but a waste of time and space. 

I always felt like I don't belong, like I'm some kind of alien, and the fact that no one ever saw me as their equal didn't help out, the icing on the cake was in college where I met a lot of people who, like always, never considered me as a friend, but I've met a girl who I absolutely fell for, and I also met a group of people that seemed cool and chill, at the start it seemed like the first time in my life I would feel human, but it quickly turned out to be a huge mistake, as she used me to get to who was at the time a person who I thought was one of my closest friends, she never had any feeling for me, even though she made it look like she did, while in reality she liked that friend, and she aslo used me to get into that group of friends, who, after some time, ousted me like everyone has already done at some point, they would cut me off when I tried to communicate, they made fun of me, they made fun of how I look, they wouldn't take me seriously, they belittled me, they never cared about me. At one point I told my closest friends about how miserable I feel and about the sadness that's eating me from the inside, but they didn't care, they thought I was exaggerating because i always laughed whenever I was with them, they weren't able to figure out that smiling and laughing is like a shield that prevented me from falling apart.

Fast forward to summer break, not a single message from them except for that one time one person texted me, but it was to ask me about that friend and if he succeeded in his business project he was doing during summer, but except from that, absolutely nothing, so as college started I just distanced myself, sitting alone and not talking to anyone, I'm like a shadow, I feel so freaking numb, it's like I'm here but my mind is somewhere else, it's just... I don't know..."

*~Myself, verbatim, around 7 hours ago*

---

Now, I'm well aware that a self-diagnosis of depression from an 18 year old seems like one of the most stupidly overdone and melodramatic things ever, but bear with me.

In retrospect, the warning signs arguably go back to Freshers' Week three weeks ago, but at the time the highs were enough to make up for it. The highs, however, are gone now – Tuesday the 28th September was my peak. 

Anyhoo, as for the symptoms that have actually inspired my present fear:

• Mood swings. To be more precise, I tend to find it really, *really* easy to enter a low in my mood, some petty thing working to make  me feel isolated, alone, sad and bitter. This is the earliest one, going all the way back to three weeks ago, but at the time there was always something that would pick me up. That's not the case anymore, and the lows are growing even more extreme.

• Changes in sleep patterns. Sleeping at night is as difficult as ever (I've always had to wait at least an hour or so in bed before falling to sleep, often more), but now I find myself far more tired during the daytime. Every attempt at reading or productive activity between lectures yesterday just ended in me nodding off. I had nothing today, but though I had plans to use that time, I instead just spent the whole of it half-asleep, with the exception of meals.

• Feeling isolated from the people I know. One of the best things about the past few weeks for me has been actually being part of a tight friend group, but that simply seems to be slipping away now. The main inciting incident recently (though it had already been beginning to take place before), stupid and petty as it is, was finding out I'd been left out of a DnD campaign the group was planning – perfectly understandable as it was specifically meant to be a 'girl's night' thing (with the singular exception of the GM), private and meant to let them learn the ropes, but even so nothing has felt the same since. Now I suddenly feel like an outsider to the group I was formerly enmeshed in, awkward, foreign, an embarrassment constantly questioning my presence. And frankly, stupid as I know it is, I genuinely cannot see things ever feeling the same now. Which brings me onto:

• Deliberately isolating myself from the people I know. Over the days since, I've constantly kept to myself, permanently staying in my room whenever I don't have a lecture or meal to get to. Whenever I hear voices and activity, I ignore it. Whenever I see the others, instead of going to be with them, I stay away and try to pretend to myself that they don't exist, painful as it is. I even got a comment on this from someone earlier today, asking where I'd been as she felt like she'd hardly seen me.

• In general, all my worst traits are coming to the fore. I am irritable, I am envious, and I am bitter. Easily driven to all these emotions, and with a constantly toxic inner monologue. None of this is new, but I swear it was never so strong a part of me as now.

---

I have little reason to be depressed. What reasons I do have are petty, and even these ""symptoms"" feel stupid and inconsequential compared to the sort of thing I'm all too aware that people go through. But nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that even if I am not in the early stages of depression, a matter of weeks has still taken me from feeling on top of the world to feeling like utter shit."
wafflerider57,2021-10-16 20:10:13+00:00,Can anyone help me? I just can’t go on anymore.,I know this seems untrustworthy but I don’t have any shame anymore. I am borderline homeless and going to lose everything. I can’t even pay a bill. I lost my job about a month ago because my health got so bad I couldn’t work and i am in the long process of trying to get disability and food assistance. I blew through my savings in a month. It’s taking forever. It could be another month before I get food assistance And disability is looking bleak. I know it’s my own fault for getting this way but it is what it is. I’ve lost my car and have no food. I know this is awful but I have no shame anymore. I don’t have any family because I grew up living couch to couch with random relatives and when you’re 18 you’re basically out in your own. My credit is also toasted so I can’t even borrow enough to get on my feet. I shouldn’t be middle aged and facing this. Idk what to do. Can anyone on here maybe cashapp me some money and I can pay you back when I get on my feet? I know this sounds awful but I have no shame anymore. I’ve been eating one potato a day for a week. I am going to try to go to a food bank if I can get a ride next week but churches are so backward around here idk if they will help. It also doesn’t help being gay in Kentucky. Anyways I know this sounds like a scam and I don’t really care if you think that or not anymore. I’m that broken and soul crushed. It’s not a scam though I swear. Even if you can cashapp me please send some good vibes up. Thank you.

i just don’t know what to do anymore and have come to you all for advice. i’m not sure what sub to put this in bc this may be due to my adhd or it could be due to my depression or something else entirely. i’m being treated for both so idk idk any advice/ insight is appreciated"

Economy-Lobster-9550,2021-10-16 13:29:51+00:00,Depressed bf?,"Hi, 

So my (F25) boyfriend (M23) broke up with me twice within a span of a week. He was diagnosed to depression and anxiety when he was twelve, and also has adhd. Started taking SSRIs when he was in college but recently decided to stop taking them.

 We were in long distance relationship, 3.5 hours away from each other. He called me one Wednesday and told me that we need to break up because he can’t stand long distance even though he still has feelings for but he needs to protect his mental health. Even though I was supposed to move to his city in a year and come see his almost every weekend, and spend summer there as well. I was crushed cause it came out of nowhere for me, and nobody has ever hurt me so much. Like we planned things that Monday and Tuesday. I went to his city on Friday to talk in person, and tell him that it’s a fear based reaction and maybe we should not rush decisions because he’s not in the best place mentally but I’m always here for him and want to support him because I care about him so so much, and he just can’t push me away like this. He cried and told me that he missed me and he’s just a really confused person now but he’s willing to try things. We spent weekend together and planned things again. I left his city on Sunday and he was like thank you for not letting me do a dumb decision. We talked 4 hours over the phone on Monday, but on Wednesday he called me again (kind of ironice that it happened at the same time just in a week), and told me that this is not working for him AGAIN. I’ve been in such emotional rollercoaster, and the way he went about breakup was completely dismissive, something that doesn’t sound like him. I’ve been really trying to reconcile how a person who cared about me so much (and I don’t think he faked it) is able to hurt me twice, knowing how crushed I was and that I’m always there to support him and accommodate his needs. We decided not to talk to each other for a bit. 

Im just wondering if it’s the side effects of his ssris withdrawal or he just doesn’t like me enough to fight for what we have.Despite that he hurt me so much (which makes me feel like I’m just disposable and he has not prioritized my mental health in any way), I still care deeply about him. He also told me that he has not spiraled this bad in terms of his mental health in years. And he only seems to have 2 friends in his city, and one of them is a complete self-absorbed prick, which I don’t even know why he’s friend with. What would you do in this situation?"

They were the only person I trusted. I thought I had found my soulmate. I sacrificed my own fucking mental health to help them and everything I get back is being treated like trash.

Welp guess now that we're practically strangers I can't lose anything out of our relationship anymore. I was scared to tell our school councilor about my friends problems because whenever I brought that topic up they'd get angry. I thought if I said anything they'd end our friendship. That problem is nonexistent anymore though.

They were vulnerable around me and opened up to me. I'm betraying their trust but ,well, we aren't friends anymore so who cares."

I feel like a shell of myself, I’ve felt like this for many years now. I remember thinking depression only looked like staying in your dark room for weeks at a time, because that’s what my mom’s depression looked like. I have learned to function very well in very stressful and intense situations which is why when I brought up my feelings of depression to the people around me, they tried finding solutions rather than offering me their ears to listen to me. I don’t really blame them I understand.

I had also took it upon myself to get therapy. It did not end up helping me, I don’t even understand why I was there I just felt like it was something right to do but who could know me and help me better than myself?

Life happens and I go along with whatever that happens to be that day. It feels like there’s only one way my life is going to end anyway and I can’t see a reason to bother trying when that’s the result. 

There’s also the constant thoughts that everyone is talking about me behind my back and no one appreciates what I do. The worst part is that I don’t know if it’s even true or not. Maybe it’s all in my head and I’m the asshole when I get irate towards people who truly did nothing wrong. Or maybe I’m right and I’m just the idiot that everyone is laughing at. I can’t help but get triggered when I hear whispering or people talking on the phone. My brain automatically assumes it’s about me and I’m sitting there trying to figure out what I did wrong this time.

Being placed in care due to my mothers selfishness and constantly failing at everything like trying to kill myself.
Basically, I get I’m not the only one who has shit life, however, it’s just really draining just breathing. I sleep all day and still wake up exhausted, I’ve tried reaching out to so-called experts and I get advised to do fucking Yoga. Because yoga solves all the fucking problems in the world. I was even told once my traumas were too much for the expect to handle and there was nothing they could do for me. My parents are both fucking idiots, honestly…they shouldn’t have had children, especially together."

They was in one of their moods, we BOTH slacked on cleaning and he gets confintational. I got really angry when they confronted me about something dirty and explained why (although I did have an additude... that's on me.) I apologized soon after and it was like talking to a wall. I went to take a nap to see if it was lack of sleep. 
They start cleaning in the room when I had the door closed. This wakes me up. I ask why they were cleaning in here. They say ""it's because it's full of dirty dishes and trash."" This struck a nerve with me, so I locked the door. They try to reenter and I just said I want to be alone.

And suddenly today I had the energy to go out for lunch and actually communicate, even if it was little. 
Now I’m back home and I’m suddenly having the urge to plan for my future and get out of this rut.

Unfortunately speaking from previous experiences, this high isn’t gonna last long and soon I’ll wake up ready to end everything again.

I used to think depression was about always being low and sad and angry, but now I realize it’s a lot more complicated than that.

throwawaythoughts333,2021-10-15 15:46:06+00:00,Making same mistakes again,"Hello, sorry for a long post. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. Thank you for whoever reads this.

I'll start with events 4 years ago when it all started.  I am 22 year old male. I used to work in a bar where I met a girl I instantly fell in love with . We got to know each other well, went on dates etc. She was everything I ever wished for.

I'm from a small village and I have some good friends here. We  were always considered to be the  ""bad guys"" because we partied a lot etc. I never done drugs thought.

She always assumed I do drugs and one day I decided to take some to impress her ( stupid I know) I guess to keep up with the bad guy reputation. Problem is, I fell in love with cocaine.

And that's when my life went into a downwards spiral. I started taking cocaine for breakfast everyday. I turned it an angry mess, our relationship slowly got ruined. I was angry at her one day and tried sleeping with her best friend. I was nothing but a scumbag. I was a cheating,  lying scumbag. I didn't see that at the time but now it's very clear for me to see. She deserved better than me

After overdosing once, We broke up and she moved away. I decided I had enough and went sober.  I went through some very rough time then. I was very deeply hurt and depressed. Day by day it got better. 

4 years have passed and I still never fully got over her even when I was with other girls but I was living more or less fine. I don't really like this town but I have some great friends and reasonably good new job.

Anyway, after all these years, last weekend I was out drinking with friends and I met an old friend who offered me a bag of cocaine for some reason i  snapped back to my old habits and bought a bag.

I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol. And out of all the placed I could of met her again she walked in to the kitchen where I was dashing out lines of cocaine in a state where I could barely stand or speak. I tried telling her I wasn't the man I was when we first met,  but of course she didn't believe it, why would she ?  Somehow I managed to achieve some sort of success with her. We danced and kissed etc. But she's probably just lonely since coming back to town since most of her friends are gone away. We never had sex that night but I couldn't have sex even if I wanted to due to state I was in.

I woke up next morning and all my feeling for her came back, all the love it took me years to forget, but I knew that it was over, it was just a one night thing. It crushed me. All these years breaking away from my habits wasted when it came down to a person it mattered. I was still the same lying drug addict in her eyes as I was 4 years ago.

It's been a week and I feel empty, only emotion I have is constant hint of anger and sadness in me. I stopped eating or doing anything except working , I work 9-5 and then I go to my garage where I work on projects and drink alcohol until am I able to sleep. Maybe I am still the same scumbag I was 4 years ago. Iv been having suicidal thoughts but I know I can't do that since I need to look after my family. I would rather suffer myself then let my family suffer. 

At first I thought it was just a comedown from drugs since I haven't touched them in so long. But I still miss her more and more everyday. I have dreams about her at night where we are happy together. I messaged her a few times but she's always busy and takes a long time to reply.

I'm just so lost, all these years to recover just to slip back into my old days when it mattered the most. She gave me an opportunity to fix what I once broke but instead I proceeded to ruin it further. 

Thank you to whoever reads this. I just wanted to get this of my chest or speak to someone anonymously."

m001001001,2021-10-15 13:56:00+00:00,"Depressed people, you’re the reason for the depression","Just like the title says. You’re the reason for your depression. Simply stop being depressed and start seeing the good things in your normal day. Do you know how many people have it way worse than you? Examples: Starving children in Africa, people washing themselves in toxic rivers I. China etc. 

And then we have you. Most likely you’re feeling “useless to this world” or “no one cares about me”. 

First of, no one is useless. Each person contributes to the manpower. Get a job, work, buy things, have fun. Get objectives to do. Easy as that. You’ll contribute to your countries economics in a way or two, at least. 

If you feel like “no one would care if I die” then yeah that’s true. Maybe your mom or something will care, but after 2-3 months no one will remember you. And the fact that you care about that is why you’re depressed. Also, most people (like 95%) would be forgotten sometime. Mostly after a year or so. 

I honestly can’t see the point of being depressed. That’s such a waste of time. And it’s even more embarrassing to wanting to take your own life over no one caring when you die or some shit. 

These words come from me, a 14 year old that has 10 times more fun life than you.

Obs: don’t come up with that shit about “I don’t know how life is when I’m an adult”."

bobsmith27050,2021-10-15 10:24:18+00:00,Why am I always not good enough,"I’ve struggled with seeing a point to life for a while and along cutting and being suicidal. It’s gotten as bad at times that I’ve researched ways to kill myself and also learnt to tie a noose. However my parents seem to always find a reason for me not being good enough (they know I’ve been suicidal a few years ago but not currently). I struggle with school in the sense of I don’t enjoy it or see a point to it however I get A and B’s in everything and get my work done.  My parents decided to contact school because they think I’m not doing enough and that because I’ve struggled with motivation to be active during lockdown even though I’m sporty. They always just find a way to have a go at me and i can’t take it day after day, I really want to kill myself and end all of this because all their doing is pushing me closer and closer to the edge."
Anxiousfox101,2021-10-15 09:25:15+00:00,What to do if I fail out of college again?,"So, this isn’t a rhetorical question. I’m legitimately looking for advice. Considering this is depression central, I figure at least one other person on here must have failed college due to not being able to do anything. But anyway, let me give you the 411. I failed my first semester of college. I said fuck it, and spent the next few months searching for a full time job. But I could not get hired anywhere. So, I decided I would go back to school. So, I did. The first semester back, I actually did really good. But this semester is not going too well and I see it as a legitimate possibility that I fail out again this semester or in the next. So, basically I’m wondering if anyone has experience with something similar to this and maybe some advice on how to get through it. My mom would be super mad, but thankfully she wouldn’t throw me out. Still, I’d want to leave my house ASAP because it would be extremely tense with my mom and stepdad. 
Tldr: I could fail school again, does anyone have experience in getting past it?"

FaithlessnessOther,2021-10-15 03:45:07+00:00,I have 0 Energy to go on,"Ugh so a little background I am a recovering heroin addict and have been clean almost 3 years. However I feel like about 2 of those years I’ve been seriously depressed. The first year everything was new and different and exciting , so that brought happiness. Now I’m just sick of everything , but I know going back to drugs will make me more depressed and suicidal again. Then on the other hand I sometimes think at least when I was getting high I was happy sometimes. I’m not suicidal currently , but just have 0 energy for anything. I sleep most of my day away even if I’m not so tired. Some days I sleep 12-16 hrs depending on what’s going on. I have sleep apnea , so I use that as an excuse as to why I sleep all the time. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I don’t even listen to music anymore , because I just don’t enjoy it at all anymore. I used to be one of those people that always had headphones in listening to music constantly. I don’t enjoy sex anymore. I have no sex drive at all. I don’t want to be around people anymore. I don’t like going out unless I have to. I own my own business that I ran into the ground , because it’s hard to work for yourself when your depressed. I know that I don’t HAVE to do anything. When I had a normal 9-5 job I knew that I had to wake up at a certain time and be somewhere and do a job. Now I only work when I’m so low on money that I can’t survive. I live with my parents , so that amount can get pretty low. I just feel like such a failure after running my business into the ground and spending over 15K on things that are just sitting in storage , because I don’t have the motivation to deal with it. I get so overwhelmed when I see it all , because it’s such a mess and so unorganized it just makes me more depressed looking at it all. I also have horrible ADHD , so I can’t focus on anything. If I do attempt to get things done I usually start 20 projects and finish none of them. I just miss being happy. I miss simple things like getting dressed , doing my hair and makeup , actually caring about what I look like. Now I just throw my hair in a bun and put on sweats and a T-shirt. The summer is my absolute favorite season! When I’m not depressed I’m outdoors 24-7. I used to love the beach , hiking , jet skiing , amusement parks ,ETC. This summer I pretty much sat in the house all summer , because I had no energy to do anything nor did I have any interest in the things I used to love. The winter is coming here in NY and I have horrible seasonal depression , so I already know this is going to be even worse in the coming weeks. I have a therapist, but I feel like I don’t get much out of it. I don’t even make half of my appointments, because I don’t have the energy to get up. I’m on Paxil for depression and gabapentin for anxiety. I don’t think the meds are working for me anymore , but I don’t see an actual Psychiatrist . My doctor refuses to change or increase my meds. I’ve tried exercising , therapy , changing my diet , etc. Nothing seems to be helping. I’ve even been thinking about getting back with my shitty ex , because I just want some sort of “excitement” in my life. So sorry for the lengthy rant , but I just wanted to vent to some people who don’t know me. Thanks if you read this ! Stay strong my fellow depression warriors."
Luca_02-59,2021-10-15 03:11:30+00:00,"Well hello there, death","Hello, I'm just some guy in my low twenties having an existential crisis don't mind me I'm just venting.

I reeeaally want to believe that something exists after we die, just anything. Any sort of either physical or non physical place where there is some sort of consciousness. But sadly I don't. 

And I find it very scary and uncomfortable to think about what it is like to not exist anymore.
And I've never believed in anything, this is my only life, one shot, one opportunity to sieze everything you've ever wanted and all that. But when it's over? ITS OVER, DONE.. Finished.
Like, I'm pretty sure I'm going crazy thinking about it, at least it feels that way. 
I've already spent 22 years doing absolutely nothing.
Or well at least the past 8 I guess. Just passing time, no hobbies, no friends, barely any family left. 
And I try to think how this can keep up, but it won't. I know that. But I'm still not doing anything. It's like, I care. But I don't? I'm comfortable. Even if I should be panicking. 
I can almost literally see the dark and endless pit that I've been digging myself into. And I've been digging without a care in the world! 

Oh a girlfriend? 
Sure I love her, alot. but naah not what I need right now, or something.
A helping friend from my childhood? Wow you're useful, better stop answering your texts before you make too much sense. 
My mom and siblings, for once, actually asking me how I feel? 
Ouf, never really prepared for this.. this could get quite ugly.. better lie straight to their faces about how I feel fine, it's been a bit difficult but things are getting on track again, oh yeah I've been looking for work, oh no I absolutely did not mean to burn myself on the stove yesterday I just got stuck in my thoughts. Really? Well even if I did need a therapist we can't afford one can we?

You ever just feel like this thing we're all doing, this life thing, isn't for you? I don't feel like I react to things as I should. Happiness, anger, sorrow, pain, comedy, bliss, hate, love. I don't get it.

Sorry for rant just typing out my chaos or something"

I was told I had anxiety when I was younger, but I feel like helping myself helped me more than any pill ever did or could. While I still struggle with my anxiety, what I have been feeling lately is much more unfamiliar to me. It's almost like opening your eyes, and realizing that what you wished and hoped for for a long time is never going to happen. There have been a few good things in my life recently, but I'm afraid that those few things are going to fall apart too. I started snapping a girl that I really like that went away to school, but in the back of my mind I'm so used to failure and heartbreak that it feels inevitable it will lead nowhere except disappointment. I don't want to be like this, and I want to learn from my experiences with anxiety to finally fight back against my negative thoughts. I just don't know how. I have a few good friends, but they aren't the type of people I feel like I can lean on for this. I know that they mean well, but they just aren't those types of people, if you get what I mean. I'm not sure what I was expecting to get out of this, maybe it's just to vent or look for advice or positive energy. What I do know for absolute certain is that I'm scared, but I don't exactly know what I'm scared of. Sorry for the long post and thanks for letting me share my thoughts with you all."

ftssgd,2021-10-14 23:14:07+00:00,"I started questioning my sexuality, told my friends, then realized I was just confused. I feel like I ruined my life.","At a certain point in my late teens, I started questioning whether I was a little bisexual or not. I had some fear over some gay feelings as a kid, but I’ve come to learn that’s pretty normal. I had zero fear of people thinking I was gay or not because I was naïve. 
At a party, I got drunk and mentioned that I think I may be a little gay. I got drunk another time and said the same thing. Eventually, I got curious and ended up blowing a guy. I never told anyone about that, and at the time I wasn’t ashamed of it, but now (years later) I’m mortified. 
I feel like I’ve lost all respect from my friends and I’ve lost all confidence. Sometimes I’ll think about it and panic. I have no fucking clue how to move forward from this. It feels like I’ve ruined my entire life and I hate the people who made me think it was ok to experiment with that shit. How the fuck am I supposed to move forward?"

I don’t know if I have any good life prospects left and I feel like my life is over before it even began.

In some aspects I improved, like school, my sleep and I was eating more. But the feeling is always there, the problems are still there, all my effort to improve wasn't enough, even If I did my best.

This year was about doing what is ""less worse"" and I feel like my whole life will be this way, because this year I had to take ""less worse life changing decisions""(no idea if this phrase makes sense, I'm Brazilian).

All you have to do is click my profile.  Quick cliff ones- polydrug addict, ex-prison  in early years, but now business owner and doing half okay (apart from the title of this thread!)

But I mean, I feel like everything is so readily accessible, drugs, porn, easy hook ups and lays. And the Internet has created devolution among people instead of evolution (and I'm not talking about technology, but about respect and common courtesy among each other)

I sound and feel like a really old traditional man, even though I'm 32 i have very traditional values around faithfulness and respecting elders... even though i grew up in the ghetto as a drug runner from 15, looking at me, you'd think I was a big jock 6'2 - 220lb meathead douche who would kill you not think twice about beating your ass, and leaving you in a ditch - but looks can be deceiving.. and in a very nice protective person. Especially of the vulnerable in my community. In the past if vulnerable have been targeted, I step right the fuck in. We should protect our community against the degenerates.

I feel like I was born in the wrong era sometimes, and just wanted to vent  the 1950s look heavenly to me. I understand my hypocrisy about complaining about the Internet over the Internet by the way, you don't need to point this out.  I just wish traditional values were still a thing of modern era, but each year I watch them slip away... I'm part of the problem through human weakness, and that saddens me to some degree.

theuselessfailure,2021-10-14 16:29:53+00:00,TIL my parents never taught me to handle my emotions.,"So currently I’m on a spiritual journey, more like just healing my inner trauma and coming to terms with the fact that basically every family member I have, and close family friends abused me verbally emotionally and occasionally physically, for a long time. 

I’m also fairly sure due to my attachment style that I was neglected, now another problem with this journey is that I don’t remember much of my childhood, my brain just cuts it out. I have very little memories from before the age of 12 &amp; very partial memory between now and then. 

On my journey I am doing something called shadow work, basically it’s a prompt given for you to right about or work through the emotions of. My prompt today was “How were you taught to deal with emotions as a child?” 

Now after a good few seconds of thinking, I realized, even when I was taken in due to an attempt, neither my mother nor father really tried to understand how I was feeling and help me through it. Actually, if i showed too much emotion it would be discounted or often punished in one way or another. I think I still have yet to see how badly my parents abused me. 

I sat and thought back longer, even when I had outburst, if I did it was because id been pushed to that point, even now I’ll let people push me to the breaking point before I snap. 

Idk made me question everything, curious to see what others have to say?"

Minako859,2021-10-14 16:05:57+00:00,"Lost, broken, defeated &amp; unloved ….","I am completely miserable, I am sad &amp; lonely all the time.  Both my parents are dead &amp; the remaining family I have don’t want anything to do with me because I’m gay &amp; an embarrassment to the family.  

A few years ago I was involved in an accident that left me unable to work &amp; on disability.  After that happened I became extremely depressed from losing everything that was important to me. My new limitations &amp; mental state slowly drove away the friends I had, now no one talks to me &amp; I sit home alone all day, everyday.  This isn’t life, I’m not living &amp; I am in so deep there is no light at the end of the tunnel anymore, just soul crushing darkness, I want all of this to end with every fiber of my being.  I did not know it was humanly possible to be this unhappy, yet no matter how much I cry, or how hopeless it feels, regardless of the overwhelming pain &amp; isolation I’m in I still don’t have the courage to end it.  

I can’t go on like this, I am deeply terrified that this last thread of saintly I’ve been clinging to is going to break &amp; I’ll have no other option but to be committed to a mental hospital.  All I want is to find some sort of peace where I don’t feel this way, the quiet darkness of death feels like the only shot I have at that.  But no matter how hard I try I can’t “pull the trigger” … 

Im sitting here with a knife, a big bottle of pain killers &amp; jug of vodka but can’t do it, I am a coward. Instead I’m going to let myself live in this misery, I’m going to sit by &amp; watch it get worse, everyday I’ll fall a little  deeper into the black abyss until the last piece of my sanity breaks &amp; my soul is gone forever.  

I don’t want to accept it but I know where this path is leading, it’s bringing me straight to a mental institution where I’ll spend the remainder of my life in a cold white room, drugged out of my mind in a single hospital bed just being a drain on society &amp; the workers who are forced to take care of me. 
 
 …. I often dream of a family member or friend who suddenly realizes how badly I need help &amp; how easy it would be for them to give it.  I fantasize how they’d rush over to give me a big hug, to apologize for everything &amp; assure me I won’t ever be alone or feel unloved again…. then I quickly realize that’s not the world I live in &amp; im supposed to save myself, but the truth is I don’t have the capability or strength left in me to do so.  

Lost, broken, defeated &amp; unloved …."

I have also never had a boyfriend and feel pressure especially from my family to get one as 'no one will want you', 'you're not 21 anymore' oh and 'you need experience' as they've told me, even though they were the ones that stopped me from hanging out with friends growing up and said that they 'would break my legs' if I got a boyfriend and now all of a sudden they expect me to just magically get one to keep them happy. I am 26f btw.

Ever since the pandemic started, I felt very empty. I went from being optimistic and happy to becoming pessimistic and depressed slowly over time. I’ve had multiple sad events take place over the past 2 years and it got worse over time. I even had suicidal thoughts at one point. 

For the past month, I’ve been smoking marijuana and took psychedelics for the first time. I’ve heard about research that scientists are doing on psilocybin and it helping depression, especially through microdosing. I’ve heard mostly good things about it. 

I actually have been feeling better about myself and have a little bit of hope for my future. Marijuana helps my anxiety issues and I feel so much less nervous under the influence. I took mushrooms a week ago and ever since I became more positive about my body and want to show self-improvement mentally and physically. I actually started actively working out and educating myself more on topics I enjoy.

I genuinely think these have been actively helping me keep away from bad habits. I’m hoping to continue working on myself and one day see myself as what I always wanted to be."

bigggbitch,2021-10-14 00:44:53+00:00,My issues with my parents are adding to my depression and idk if I’m right in feeling this way,"Apologies for how long this post is going to be. 

So I (F17) have over the past year come to many realisations about the way I’ve been treated by my parents throughout my childhood. As a result, I’ve distanced myself from them even more than I already had when I was younger. This is playing a great deal on my mental health and is making my overall environment not something I wish to be a part of. I have never felt like I can trust my parents or have their support on an emotional level. Don’t get me wrong I am very very grateful for what they have provided me with over the years but this is more of a material thing, I genuinely really am grateful for this. However, I have a few issue which I simply cannot forget about and are playing on my mind very heavily at the moment and I want to know if I am the wrong for feeling this way and as a consequence making my own environment a bit too toxic, for lack of a better word. I wish I could tell someone in real life this but I’m too scared of the consequences.

Firstly, my main issue with them, especially my father, is the way that they chose to “discipline me”. I say it like this because I know that this is the way they were brought up but it doesn’t mean it’s right. Ever since I was little for any mistake I made even if it was small I was hit and over the years it would happen for the littlest things which didn’t warrant such a response and sometimes I didn’t even know why. I wasn’t “beaten up” but I was hit hard enough for it to hurt and I don’t bruise easily so it never left a mark. An example of a few occasions which stick out to me are once when I was about 8/9 I was sitting on the toilet and at this time I wasn’t allowed to lock the door. Out of no where, I see my dad burst through the door he grabs my arm and starts to hit me a few times, at the same time he’s telling me that if I hadn’t done what I did he wouldn’t have to do this, he doesn’t like doing this but he has to and it hurts him more than it hurts me etc and I still to this day have no idea what I did. Also, when I was about 10/11ish all the family was in the kitchen and my father was washing the dishes I was playing a game with my younger brother, who in their eyes is too precious but we’ll get onto that later, in this game it require us to softly punch each other on the arm, however, he turn around and I end up grazing his nose, I did not cause him any pain. I began to apologise profusely but it was too late, my father stopped the dishes held me up against the door and started hitting me multiple times and I genuinely had never felt so scared in my entire life. I then told him I apologised and he was like yea I know I had to do that because of the way you spoke to your mum. I never said a word to her. As of more recent times, I was 16, one night after I had a long day I was sitting on the sofa at one end and my day at the other end and my Mum on the opposite sofa. I was so exhausted that day that I just fell asleep. About 10 mins later I’m woken up to my father shouting, I’m still half asleep so I’m not really paying attention but I realise he’s screaming my name and getting angry that “I’m pretending to sleep and ignoring him”. He keeps this going for a while to which I raise my voice, half asleep, and shout “what”. The next thing i feel is my arm getting dragged towards him and he hits me on my arm extremely hard. I wasn’t functional so I had no idea what was going on until I felt that. Because of that I stopped talking to my father and was very distance with my mother because she just let it happen. I get home from school the next day and my mother starts to act all disappointed with me because I’m not talking to my father, she tells me off for not accepting his apology which is him messaging me one sentence saying that he’s going to pick up my medicine. She then proceeds to guilt trip me into speaking to him again, which I wasn’t ready to do. There are only a few incidents which stuck out the most to me which I keep replaying in my head and it won’t stop. Because of this I’ve always been scared of my father and never been able to trust him or my mother. Even during our good times or day to day life I’ve been anxious around them but 1. Never shown it and 2. Only just realised it was anxiety. It doesn’t happen as frequently now because I try to avoid them both as much as I can but I know that my father still thinks that he can do that to me. He still raises his hand to me and will still sometimes hit me if I do something wrong but not as hard as before but because of how it was before, this is likely to trigger a panic attack for me. What I fail to understand is how this man can tell his son that he should never hit a woman or fight a girl but do that to his own daughter. Now I feel extremely uncomfortable being around him or touching my parents at all, hugging them or them showing me affection gives me so much anxiety that I feel like I’m going to throw up. They cannot respect the fact that I can’t deal with touching them and just a few weeks ago I refused to hug my father and he just grabbed me and I tried to get out but he wouldn’t let me, this gave me a panic attack.

As well as that, my whole life I’ve always felt like I mean nothing in comparison to my younger brother. My parents thought that my grandparents favoured me more because were very close, but prevented my brother from going to my grandparents as much as I did so they didn’t form as strong of a connection so my brother didn’t want to go there even though my grandparents wanted him there. As a consequence, they over compensated for it at home, he would get all of the attention and I don’t mean it in a selfish give me attention way I mean it in a I just want your help sometimes or I want you to love me to sort of way. I thought for the longest time that something was wrong with me because they couldn’t love me like they love him. I’m not saying they did nothing for me but I’m saying that it was clear who was more of a priority for them. They believe that he can do no wrong and this was even in his behaviour. He would misbehave at family events and my fathers friends would tell him that his son is acting up, to which my father would get angry at his friends for saying such things. He would constantly get in trouble at school and instead of telling him it’s not right, they’d tell his teachers off. I personally was not one to get into trouble at school so I can see why he may get more attention in that sense but I used to ask them for help with my work or something and they would always do things with him but when I worked hard for my good grades he would use that to say that he’s so stupid and victimise himself. They have a whole shelf with his achievements and pictures in the living room so when I took a small area on a tiny shelf for my trophies, they were sent up to my room a month later. They give time to his activities like football and told me I could do something if I wanted but never followed up. They’ll make excuses for him not to go to school if he doesn’t feel like it. One day my day was getting his new car delivered and they let him take the day off school to see the new car. Growing up I never felt like they loved me as much as they should have so I learnt to not need their love and as a result I cannot love them the way that I should. It got to a point where my brother was getting away with murder and I was getting hit for the most insignificant things all the time. Recently they’ve come to realise that my brother is actually not as great I think but they still make excuses for his bad behaviour, and behaviour which is displayed to me, saying it’s a boy thing, you have to let him do it etc. They care more about me now, that’s clear but it’s too late now I don’t need them to care about me I can’t deal with it now because I’ve dealt with it already and moved in but now I get uncomfortable when they try to support me in a more full on way and truthfully I don’t want it. 

Not as important, my father and brother especially, loved and love to make fun of my weight. Since I stared to put on weight around age 7/8 I would have my dad making fun of me and my brother soon started to do this too. I was diagnosed with a few medical conditions which explained the weight gain and I was struggling to control these but they still continued. I felt horrible about myself because I was just a “whale” and “too lazy”. Even now that I’ve lost over 20kgs and I’m actually skinny I still get my bother making those comments. 

Also, over the past year or two I’ve started to create boundaries for myself when it comes to my parents and I’ve also become extremely depressed and anxious because of multiple things including these. I think I’ve always had depression and anxiety but it’s really bad now. It’s the reason why I’ve lost so much weight and at the beginning of the year I stared to sh again and I had planned to commit suicide. There is a reason I stopped sh and I didn’t go through with it but that’s not important to this. My parents know none of this but my mum had to find out that mentally I wasn’t doing well because I went to the hospital for it. I would have never told her because I’ve never felt like I can and I don’t trust her because I’m a very private person only one person has ever heard me say I’m depressed and this is starting to become news across my whole family and I can’t deal with people knowing and it kills me inside that people know. Anyways, I get called selfish when I set these boundaries and they try to make me feel bad, I get called lazy because I have no energy to do anything anymore, I can’t even clean my room. My mum goes on saying that she wants to help me and I’ve told her I don’t want or need her help, I do agree this is harsh but I would rather be straightforward than lie about it. I don’t have the energy to pretend like I want her help and support. I’ve learnt how to do it on my own because I’ve wanted her support like that for so long that now it just feels like an insult for her to want to give it because when I needed it I never got it I had to deal with everything on my own. When I was little they made me feel so small and I learnt that the only person who had my back was me so I learnt how to make sure I was good and how to give myself the support and now I feel uncomfortable with what she’s saying and I can’t handle it. 

I know that they’ve provided me with a house and food and clothes and they’ve bought me things I’ve wanted. I know that they do love me and care about me but it’s taken me most of my life to figure it out. I’m grateful for what they have given me and I’m grateful that they’re going to help me pay for university but I don’t think that I love them how I should. I don’t plan on keeping close contact with them and I am very blunt with them but I genuinely do not wish to use the energy I don’t have to pretend like they haven’t caused me and are causing me so much pain. I cannot look them in the eyes and being around them gives me more anxiety than I’ve ever felt. I do feel bad for the way I’m being and I feel like the problems I have with them I’m making too big at times but then I just remembered how scared and unloved I used to feel. What 7 year old should wish that she was never born? I’m not saying they did nothing for me and they have done things for me which I really do appreciate I just am so confused about how to feel. Deep down I know I don’t love them like I should and I want the least amount of contact with them in the future but I feel like I’m overreacting and making this a big thing but if it’s affecting me and affected me to the point where I can’t look at them properly it does actually seem like a big thing. Am I making this bigger than it is and am I right in feeling this way about them? Is my treatment of them too harsh?"

vrtxlogic66,2021-10-13 23:05:33+00:00,Nothing is getting better (kinda long sorry),"First post so don't really know how to do this but i just want to get some feelings out of my head that have been going around my head for a while now and explain why trying to reach out for help has made me regret doing so.

I've just recently been feeling as though nothing feels worth it anymore. for the better part of the last 2 years i have actively seeked professional help for my low mood and anxiety, and throughout this time i have never felt worse. i know it sounds contradictory but ever since seeking help i have never felt more isolated and alone.  when i first reached out i was probably in the lowest point i had ever been in, in my life. i did it as a random act of desperation as it was increasingly starting to feel like the only way out way was suicide. after reaching out to the services recommended to me by my educational services, i had to wait for 3 month for a text message asking to arrange a phone call., i knew that i would be placed in a que when i reached out but those 3 months of waiting only worsened my thoughts as i started feeling hopeless and forgotten. 

After going through all the typical basic personal info stuff and briefly out lining my problems i was assigned a therapist. after waiting another month (November by this point, i seeked help in July) i finally met someone who i thought i could talk to, and for a time i thought i could until i was told that the person i was meeting with is transferring me to another ""more experienced colleague"". i wasn't comfortable with this sudden change but i didn't want to be a pain and ask not to be. so i waited 4 month, in which time the pressure of upcoming final exams were not helping my mood, i had a number of various 1 off meetings with random therapist via videocalls leading up to April.

In early April i met my (up until recently) permanent support therapist. They where really understanding of how i had been feeling throughout the whole process of being passed on from one person to another. we started CBT sessions and trying to work on coping methods. Anyone who has done CBT knows that often you are assigned ""Homework"" to do in the time between the weekly meetings. I did every task and coping system that i was asked to try, always thinking that they will some how make me feel instantly better (stupid in hindsight as nothing is instant i know). this had been going from April until early September when they told me that they wont be meeting with me anymore as they thought we had made significant progress. i didn't feel the same but i didn't want to confess that i felt no different, if not worse, then when we started. 

Its been just over a month since then and I've been trying my coping methods that we outlined in the sessions, but they don't seem to be helping. I'm still trying my hardest to fight my depression but i feel like in still losing. i go to bed every day hoping, praying that i simply don't wake up as it would be better for everyone, no one has to bother putting up with me, my mum can focus on my sister and not have to worry about me anymore. i wont be bothering anyone if I'm just gone. I wake up with this thought every day and every night its the same wish, to simply die in my sleep. I'm too much of a coward to do it myself yet its the only way i feel that will make everything stop. All day in college everyday in tired, I'm often distant and this has taken an effect on my friendships. Nothing is getting better despite the fact that i fight everyday and it feels like every way out of this pit that I'm in is slipping away. Last week i tried to talk to one of my closest friends about how i had been feeling and he, also having gone through the mental health system, has said that he couldn't help but feeling like no one is as concerned with our issues because of our age and gender (17m), i don't know how true this is but it has done nothing to help my feelings about myself. i don't know what to do as I'm hesitant to ask out for help again and i feel as if it would be better if i just died.

I'm really sorry for this stupid rant/ vent, but I'm just feeling angry at myself for not being successful in my coping methods, and hopeless as life has lost all meaning to me and suicide has seemed to be the only option to me for months."

But I’ve been having problems with my mom, she had been gaslighting me for a while and blaming me for everything, but she never takes me seriously about my problems. And that is not the only reason I want to do it. I want to overdose but not to the deadly point. I just want people to realize I really need help, but if my own mother won’t listen to me, who will?

Guilty_Arm_2389,2021-10-13 22:23:06+00:00,I need help,"So I had my ACT today, Oct. 13, and basically this was the worst.day.ever.

How would it feel if your parents threatened you about getting a good grade on it last night and then you didn't finish 2 of the 4 tests? Then you get yelled at home by your parents, again, because you don't know time and time management? And then you get lectured from one of them, and then they'd brag about going to university and being one of the best time managing students and how they were so smart about everything and all that?

Basically, I've cried more than 3 times today, if in my parents' opinion, I could count, that probably would be right.

I'm pretty sure I am the only person who just didn't finish the first two tests, and I feel internally miserable that I won't be able to retake it.

I told one of my proctors about me not finishing the first two tests, then I just burst out crying. He took me out into the hall, and I've said it. I've said it all.

He said that it was just a practice test and that I'd have to worry about the real crap later, but how am I supposed to feel okay if my parents are like wolverines, rushing down and making sure I get no C's at all.

My school hasn't been giving a lot of homework(except our math teacher), and my parents are extremely concerned about that. I tell them that it's to relieve stress from us all, but the only word I hear is college, college, college. How do you want me to go to college if you didn't go to college yourselves??

I know they want the best from me, but how can I do my best if they are always pushing me from my back?

I really need help. I really do."

He never done anything in the house to help us. He never wash his own clothes, He never clean the dishes, he never clean his room, he never mop the floor, etc. He is so immature, I am sick of him.    

I am a fresh graduate, I still live with my parents too while looking so hard to find a job in the pandemic. But I at least help my parents cleaning their house even with my current status of mental health.      

I've been looking for a job in my country/city for months now, and my scanner is really important to me. He used it without my permission and lost the cable. When I asked him find it, he refused and got angry saying it's not my scanner while I literally bought it with my money a decade ago. It was a simple thing I asked him to find the cable which probably is in his room, but he refused. I got angry and started talking shit to him, and he came after me and about to hit me, my mother stopped him, he lost at debate and trying use physical instead, I came after him too about to hit him because I got angry but my father stopped me.     

For context: since we were a kids he used to hit/punch/kick me a bunch of time when we had conflict. Now that I am an adult too, I don't appreciate if he is going to do the same thing he used to do as a kid, of course I will fight him back. I honestly don't want to live with this guy. Maybe I should tell my psychiatrist everything I mention in this thread.

Sorry for the rant/ sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post."

CalisthenicGenius,2021-10-13 15:00:08+00:00,I’m mentally getting worse.,"I find myself never talking to anyone. I only talk to my girlfriend who is very supportive and loving. I don’t have any friends at all. Not even one. 

My family members never talk to me at all. When my grandparents do talk to me, it’s only ever been condescending, judgemental words. Saying that I can never accomplish anything. It’s obvious they look down on me and don’t believe in me. Why? Because apparently i’m just too stupid according to them. But they treat all my siblings like pure gold. Especially my sister. My sister never talks to me unless she wants something. The only family member that talks to me like a decent human fucking being is my mother. 

I don’t talk to my family members at all besides my mother because of how they treat me. Frankly with the way they talk and act towards me, I don’t want them in my life what so ever.

To make matters worse I also have a very hard time creating friendships. 

I use to have a small bunch of blokes I hung out with heaps. Until I was nothing to them. It happened very under the blue. Completely unexpected. They stopped putting in any effort to hang out and talk to me. They stopped inviting me to events,  parties, road trips and hangouts. They would post it on their Facebook and Snapchat story. So I would always see it. Eventually they kicked me out of their friend group. After 5-6 years of friendship. It didn’t help that they did this at a very low point in my life. Now when they see me uptown they all give me the “oh it’s you look” like it’s such an inconvenience and they turn and walk the other way. Sometimes they even grunt disappointedly when they see me. One of the blokes in the group has a girlfriend and even she glares me down with such hatred. Like I murdered someone. She was like that the moment she first saw me, and met me. Naturally my first impression of her wasn’t great. All of this absolutely breaks me mentally.

All the other people I was friends with at the time also used me. For my car, money, etc. Especially this guy I use to class as my best friend for 11 years. Even though he never once acted like a best friend. 

I want to get out of town I live in. No one wants to be friends with me in my local area and I have too many bad memories in this town. I want to escape it. All of this has got me really depressed."

For the past while I've been off drugs like weed and alcohol I thought that maybe that would help and it did for awhile but now I'm as sad as I was on them.for context I dont have to many freinds like 4 I talk to each of them one time every two weeks.and for me sadness leads to anger and I've just been thinking of beating the fuck out of someone just before im having a bad day and the relationships in my family with me are falling apart I have nothing in common with them and I love them but I know I'm only gonna see them in holidays

-0Z0-,2021-10-13 00:23:56+00:00,The only thing I do is hate,"Hello...

Aside from all the problems I already suffer from and the awareness that I posses about myself regarding my own personal issues this is one I understand but I rather wouldn't want to understand.

I hate everyone around me, for every small thing they do and all the good things they do. I have become incapabel of accepting that others are and do better than me, so instead of coping with that, my mind has turned to hate those around me, whether they have done me wrong or not. It is a disease and I am reaching its limit. Loving is harder than ever. Those who I call my friends are just the people who I hate less than others. And the worst thing about all this is that I hate myself even more. I can't even look at them the regret, pain and consequences of telling everyone the truth is too much. I feel the loneliness grabing me by the shoulder again and everything I feel is fear, anger, hate and regret.

&amp;#x200B;

I know how to end it all, but that will mean for me to do the unthinkable. And honestly I don't want to go without telling everyone that I am sorry.

I regret hating them everyday and I resent myself for hating."

CNM77,2021-10-12 22:43:36+00:00,Feeling Loneliness and Hardship.,"Hello everyone, 
I have been suffering from heavy depression due to a smearing campaign on Facebook.  This campaign has ruined my professional life and destroyed all my social life. I still can't find a way to shut it down. Even with police intervention the harrasment is still ongoing.  The people behind this smearing campaign are powerful lawyers who want me as a dead character  in order to silence me. These lawyers did horrible things to my company with fake government documents to blackmail me for money, and this action can drive them to prison.  So the only way to protect their carrier is to accusing me of paranoia.  The police intervention can not help me further since it is a cyber crime and they don't care much about such conflicts. On the other hand no lawyer want to take this case as those bad lawyers are to be concerned a mafia.
I wrote a letter to briefly explain myself and wanted to publish it on Facebook so I can get my company back on the road but I received a threat phone call from a stranger to leave the city or bad things will happen to my family. 
I know that sharing my story publicly will bring more support to my situation and definitely will repair my reputation and my bring back my previous clients....but on the other hand I will live my life with even more fear that something bad might happen to my family. 
I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts in those last weeks. I know that life is hard and unfair but i still can not accept that people with more money can do whatever they want.
Is there any way to explain the situation to my family who doesn't know the details of those threats? I do not want them to know so they can live life in serenity. However sometimes I feel that I have to tell them everything. 
I am lost with my thoughts and feeling that my disappearance from this life can be peaceful for me but devastating to them..
Am I right? Am I selfish?  Am I weak ?........"

Hairguy_Blondie,2021-10-12 21:50:06+00:00,Feeling lonely,So I have suffered from anxiety and a little bit of depression for the last 2 years. In June of 2019 I got hit by a car a week before my graduation. And I was in my house with my own thoughts and feelings for like two months while I was waiting so I can walk again. And during that time I felt really alone and I still do! I feel like I don’t fit in with anyone my age I’m now 20 years old. Still nothing has changed in my life I joined tinder in 2019 I couldn’t even get a match for the longest time and when I did the girl would just stop talking to me. I still haven’t had my first kiss and I feel like I’m going to be alone forever! I do have an intellectual disability so I try to be honest as I can be. I remember matching with a girl like a year ago and I did tell her that I did have an intellectual disability and she totally just unmatched me. So I’m just guessing that I’m never gonna have any luck when it comes to relationships and I feel a lot of anger and Envy towards people who do have A relationship I really don’t know what I’m gonna do because I just feel trapped or  cursed that the universe just hates me. And I’m never gonna find a girl who gets me.

aurelie-beckers,2021-10-12 20:58:36+00:00,my unimportant vent,"My best friend is still severely depressed and I'm beginning to notice the only guy i could talk to about my problems is also doing worse. 
I do have a good family and friends but I can't talk to them about it.. I'm cutting ties with most of my friends for no reason other than the desire to be alone since i think i will only be a burden once they find out.
My trust issues won't let me tell anyone what's going through my head, except for some stranger online who lives far enough to never meet.

As i was sitting in the bus, we passed a church. When i saw the cross, images of people hanging on trees appeared in my head. I was thinking of me jumping off the roof and the moment my 'day dream' was over, we passed a undertaker. Then my thoughts went to how someone my family knew killed himself by driving into a lake. Which made me think again to my traumas I suffered during driving lessons. Tears began to fill my eyes but i tried to not cry in public. 

These last weeks, thoughts of death have been filling my head so much. Whenever i stand at the top of a stair or something like that, i'm doubting if i should let myself fall or jump. But i seem to not be able to.. So i go downstaires with my eyes closed.

Every time i'm about to eat, i feel so guilty. Every time i ate, i feel so bad i did it. The whole day long, only the thought of food seems to make me gain weight. But i don't have enough willpower to skip them. I tried a few times to throw up after lunch or dinner, but it won't work, even with a toothbrush. The simple fact i can't do such an easy thing, makes me get angry at myself.

My self harming has gotten so much worse. It's almost on a daily base now.. and i am less scared to do it, to go deeper. For the last days, i have been searching on how to overdose without suicidal intentions. And doing other stuff too..

It's really annoying.. i can't focus on my studies, at all and my friends are leaving me. I did push them away a little bit, but this just makes me realize how lonely i will be, now and in the future. There's no one left to talk to. No hobbies i enjoy anymore. The only thing distracting me are my classes (every day from 8:30 until 6). But even then, my mind gets distracted by simple words such as 'knife, cut, depression, sad, alone, death,...'

I'm not feeling like i am living anymore. It's as if i'm just present for the sake of being here."

The girl was probably only my age (15-16), and you could tell she was underage, as she was wearing her school uniform.

I feel like a loser writing this but I need help. I am 28 F which makes it more embarrassing. I’ve never had celebrity crushes until I was first diagnosed with clinical depression and I went into a rabbit hole. I’ve always had this old soul thing, where I’ve always had nostalgia for past decades, not only the aesthetic but thinking my life would be better in a different decade ( especially seeing the world with Covid )

I also deleted my social media 1 year ago Bc how bad it affect my mental state and only came on Reddit to get support. 

I got out of it, but a little background is I am a survivor of (childhood&amp; adult sexual abuse) &amp; never had a real relationship due to it. I was doing well mentally until I had to see my abuser (which is one of my family members) 
by accident by walking into a family event and not knowing they would be there. 

Fast forward to now I am 28F. I went to a concert. It was a 80s rock band. Being a rock and roll super fan I love as excited to see this band. They were amazing live &amp; I’ve always had a crush on the young version of the guitarist. 
I’ve read his books and watched his interviews in the past. 

after the concert I found a way to stalk his Instagram &amp; watch all his old interviews &amp; old performances. Triggering my obsession. 

I’ve spent days watching it but realized it’s ruining me and the young version of him doesn’t even exist. He’s old and ugly now.

I just became obsessed with the thought that if I was alive in the 80s I could of dated Him and be apart of the exciting life of rock n roll. 

I realized I’m just seeking excitement and validation and nostalgia. I also feel I will never be in a relationship due to my past abuse. 


 Knows this sounds pathetic but I’m here seeking support"
sadaboutsummin,2021-10-12 16:10:40+00:00,Failing everything; want to die,"As the title says, I am failing everything and I want to die.

I’m in a awkward place in my life rn. I moved abroad to try and escape my depression but that hasn’t worked. Back in my home country (UK) I had a shitty job, virtually no friends and no future prospects because of a lack of education. Before then I did really well in school, but dropped out with no qualifications because of depression. The main trigger was that I got rejected by my dream university. My whole life I had been depressed and I thought that if I worked hard I could go to my dream university and things will be better. That was my only hope. So when I got rejected my world crumbled.

I tried taking the qualifications a year after dropping out and failed all but one because of depression… I tried applying to a universities that didn’t require those qualifications (art school) but got rejected again… 
During this time i was working in a dead end supermarket job. I had no friends there and the pay was terrible so my life felt meaningless. I decided after the last university rejection that I would use my limited savings to go study abroad as the requirements are basically to just have the money to pay the tuition fees. I got in so I quit my job and moved to a different continent. And now that I am here i am failing again. I didn’t expect to need to study as much as we have to. In all honesty I just wanted a laid back course to do so I could have fun exploring the country. I underestimated how much time the course would need. I don’t live I student accomadation so I am completely isolated. I don’t have any native friends so I don’t get any practice using the language. These things make me depressed, which makes me lost the motivation to study or even attend class. Now I’ve fallen behind so much that I feel to ashamed/embarrassed to attend class. I don’t want my lack of skills to draw attention to myself. As I child I got severely bullied so now as an adult I fear being ostracised by others for any reason. Speaking of which, this fear has led me to hide who I am in a sense. I pretend to be someone I’m not to fit in with the few “friends” I have here but I feel sad because I know I can’t be honest abou the struggles I am having. My adhd means I find it hard to focus in class or when studying alone and it means that I can’t organise myself. I haven’t told the school because of these stigma here and because my school doesn’t seem to have any support available to international students. 
I don’t want to go back home to the UK because I really hate it hear but I can’t cope with having to repeat the semester because I know I’ll be the only one. I only have enough money for 2 semesters so I’ll feel sad and ashamed that I only learnt one semesters worth of the local language when I go back home. I really don’t know what to do. I have no one to go to for help. I feel really sad and I hate my life so much because I’m such a failure. I wish that I could kill myself to end the suffering but I’m too much of a coward :("

VeryMentallyStable,2021-10-12 12:37:37+00:00,The goldfish you bought me died today…,"You remember it, right? The one I told you not to buy cause I wouldn’t be able to take proper care of it cause I can’t even take care of myself? Maybe you don’t remember. Bet it’d be pretty easy for you to forget, last time we saw each other was about 2 years ago. Harder for me to forget though, I had to feed the fucking thing twice a day, every day for those 2 years. Remember telling you that was another reason I didn’t want you to buy it. Knew you were gonna peace out at some point and I was gonna be stuck with the fucking living, breathing reminder of you. Couldn’t just kill it or let it die. Couldn’t give it away cause I don’t know anyone. Had to just live with it. And you got to just fuck off.

Gotta love when people do what you did. When you tell em every reason under the sun why their “help” is gonna be bad for you, give em mountains of evidence of all the times it’s happened before. After all, who’d know better than me, right? I’ve only lived it a thousand fucking times, seen this shit play out over and fucking over again. But of course, you did what they always do, threw my words away cause I’m “unstable” and “depressed” and “don’t know what’s good for me”. Sure, maybe I can’t even trust my words sometimes. Maybe I don’t know what’s good for me. But I sure as shit know what’s bad for me. And yet people throw the facts away cause the guy saying em has some major chemical imbalances and so I guess everything I say is invalid by default then, huh? Funny, never heard of someone actually helping a person by gaslighting them. Cause that’s not help, it’s just fucking arrogant. 

Course, none of that matters to you. You get to make the mistake and then just disappear. You never need to learn cause by the time the teachable moment rolls around, you’re a speck on the fucking horizon already. Funny how all you specks look the same from way over here, only you’re too far from each other to ever see there’s more just like you. 

So I buried the fucking fish. The other one’s still alive though, so I guess the nightmare’s not over for me yet. Wouldn’t cry over my own parents, so I’m not about to cry over a fish. But I still had to go through the whole range of feelings. It’s my fault it died. Maybe should’ve changed the water more or something, I dunno. If you never bought it for me, probably would still be alive somewhere. So it’s still my fault. If I had’ve actually died when I tried to kill myself before you bought it for me, could be it’d be swimming in a tank somewhere still. See more value in the fishes life than my own, so I’d probably make that trade.

Y’know, at least I feel like I’ve learned something this time. Cause I’ve been burned by this shit before, but I think you burned me the worst. Hell, never had all these scars all over me before I met you. Clearly you twisted the knife a little further than anyone before you. But I think that maybe this time I’m ready to say “fuck it” and accept that no matter how badly I wanna believe it from someone, and no matter what they might say or do to convince me that they’re good for me and they’re gonna stick around and they don’t care how broken I am cause they love me anyway, that I can’t trust a single fucking person to actually mean it. Or at least to back it up with anything. 

Cause that’s the shit you only see with hindsight, can’t see it when you’re still stuck getting lost in someone’s eyes when you look at them. Sure you were good in some ways. Think part of you did care. Think you actually believed most of the things you said when you said em. Think you did go outta your way a couple times when it was pretty clear you didn’t have to, when other people might not have, like when you were the only person to visit me in hospital post-suicide attempt. When you let me stay in your guest room after I got out. But for all the good, there was a lot of bad. I think you knew I had feelings for you that went beyond friendship for a good while and I think rather than bring it up or cut it off, part of you liked it, liked the attention. You knew you didn’t feel the same, you probably knew it was fucking torturous for me to be in love with my only real friend and not know if being around her was hurting or helping more, but it would’ve been “awkward” to talk about it. So you never did. You just let me deal with it till it breached my fucking chest like a baby xenomorph, in what is still the most pathetic moment of my life to date. 

Then afterwards, you said you’d still stay friends with me, and that’s probably my bad for asking, but also, if you didn’t really wanna be, you should’ve said so. Would’ve been more respectful than clearly distancing yourself but refusing to admit anything had changed, even when I asked you about it directly. What, I’m not worth you having to feel uncomfortable for the duration of one fucking conversation? You think it’s better to make me play the “are we still friends” game for months upon months, where I still don’t have a definitive answer, years later? The fuck happened to all that, “I’m not gonna leave” shit? Or the “You’re really cool, and you deserve to be happy” garbage? Guess I only deserve to be happy if and when it suits you…

Anyway, the fish is dead. Just like I said it would be. Our friendship is buried somewhere in the backyard with it. And I guess, like with all dead things, the only choices you have are to move the fuck on or join em. Not sure which I’ll end up doing yet, but I do know it makes no fucking difference to you either way."

SoupRonin,2021-10-12 12:14:10+00:00,Taking a trip...or so i thought.,"Friday I'm getting on a plane for the first time in my life and leaving my state to see a friend. She is (or was) going through some rough times with a breakup and she asked me if I would go and hang out with her for a few days. I was ecstatic to hear her ask me that cause I kind of have feelings for her. I wouldn't push her into that after a breakup though. And she knows how I feel about her.

 So last week we both picked out a good time and an Airbnb for me to stay in and it was settled. But it felt like as the days went on she started losing interest and getting quiet. Normally we would be talking every day for hours. But then it started being like a few texts every day. So being the 30-year-old depressive anxiety-filled person I am I start having doubts and on Saturday I question if I should still go or not. She seemed still for it. But she's still quiet. 

So today it seemed she finally starts talking to me like she normally would and we start talking about the trip. And all of a sudden she asks me if I was expecting anything romantic from us out of this trip. I told her no and asked her why? I knew what she was going to say though. She said she started seeing someone. I'm crushed after hearing that. I didn't have plans to pursue a relationship with her on this trip. But I felt like if we hung out together something would happen. I can't even get a refund on the ticket or the Airbnb now. If she had told me a few days earlier I would have probably canceled. I feel like I'm going to be so depressed around her now if I go see her.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I still go? Or should I back out and forget about the money. I mean I can still go and just avoid her..."

By their own admission they didn't raise me and left it to my older sister who is only 3 years older than me. When they grow very old and want nothing more than for me to come and take care of them for a small moment.  I want them to remember that I'm too old to care about anything other than the money I'll throw at the nursing home for their basic needs. And damn it they should be nothing but grateful.

InevitableWorld4770,2021-10-12 02:36:46+00:00,"Lost my dad 2 months ago, still strugglig hard….","

\Long post

Two months ago, I lost my father, suddenly.   I took him in for a fairly routine and quick surgery, and unfortunately things went awry in recovery.  I was talking with him in the recovery room, and he had a massive stroke right before my eyes.  The nurses kicked me out, and a few hrs later they finally let me see him again.   The complications from the stroke were extremely prevalent.  He lost all right side function, and his ability to speak.  It was traumatizing to say the least.   He could completely understand what you were saying to him, but he couldnt get any words out.  I sat by his side and tried to comfort his as best I could.   They took him back for a second surgery to see if there were any issues they could resolve, and he didnt make it out of that surgery.  He was 61.  We walked into the hospital that morning, no worries in the world, and he never walked out.   

My dad and I were best friends.  We had both went through some tough times in the past, and really gravitated towards each other 7 or so years ago.   We were inseparable during that time.  Im a single dude, i dont have any kids,  and I just feel so lost and alone now.  Im so grateful that we got to spend so much time together the past few years, but damn, I’m having a hell of a hard time right now.  

I got furloughed last year during covid, but I had a decent side gig that paid the bills so I wasnt stressing it much.  Gave me lots of time to spend with my dad which was fantastic.  But since I lost my dad, I decided to get a regular job to get some routine back in my life.  Im not sure if its helping, but I’m going through the motions at least.   Trying to put on a brave face, trying to keep my moment going forward, but I’m stressed to the max, and my motivation is at all time lows.  I feel like Im not sure what I want out of life, not sure i want kids, not sure i really want to get married, I’m just here i suppose. Keep asking myself wtf is life going to throw at me next.  Think about selling all my shit and traveling for a while, maybe trying to buy some land some land out in the woods and living like a mountain man.  I don’t know wtf to do haha.  Im a mess, guess ill keep shit on autopilot till something makes sense"

cadenorris2,2021-10-11 23:14:45+00:00,Lonely and Depressed all the time.,"So I guess I'll start with my life story and maybe y'all can help me figure out whats wrong. 

I am 18 and a guy. I used to have a lot of friends, and even had a best friend since kindergarten. Then we fell away in high school. We were inseparable, and I didn't feel lonely then. 

My family is... Strange, to say the least. My dad did some pretty bad stuff, my mother is a narcissist. Pretty much everyone in my family has a mental illness of sorts, it runs in the family. 

I have two sisters, both a lot older than me. 7 and 14 years. They had a harder upbringing than me. My oldest one got the worst of it, and is now an alcoholic with a daughter, and the dad died a couple years ago from a heroin overdose in Arkansas. She's been to jail multiple times, and is quite literally, insane. She got kicked out of the house when I was very young. But from everything she's been through, it doesn't surprise me in the slightest that she is crazy. Im the closest thing my niece now has to a father.

The one closest to me (7 years older) went through a lot too.  My parents did some not cool stuff, and it left it's mark. She had an episode of psychosis that she unintentionally took out on me, and was in a psych ward for a couple days. She has now cut as much contact with our parents as possible.

Then moving on to me. I didn't go through what they did, and I definitely got the least of the psychological damage, but for several reasons I was always isolated. Always lonely. Even when my cousins would come over, I would just play video games while they did fun stuff. I got addicted to video gaming, and looking back, I don't blame myself for that. My dad was always overseas, and my mom was always on Facebook. My mom didn't have a life outside of taking care of me. My closest sister (7yrs older) could probably explain more about why our family is dysfunctional, but I quite literally never felt happy in my life. Looking back, I've ALWAYS been depressed, and just never realized it, because my parents kept telling me it was normal. Of course, it wasn't, and I would turn to the only place where I could find social contact. Video games. 



So my close sister eventually gets married, and she discovers something shocking. Her husband's family isn't dysfunctional. They all are super close, and enjoy being around each other. And my sister takes a long time to feel welcomed (another consequence of our upbringings, feeling like a burden on everyone) but when she does, she is met with a love that she has never experienced before. She hurt me emotionally a lot in the process, but she woke me up to the situation I was in. Of course, it was life changing. I didn't know what to think. My whole life had been a lie. She eventually convinces me to live with them, and after some incredible stress in my life when my other sister moved back in, I agreed. (I was probably 16-17 at this time, so no more than a couple of years ago) Of course, it takes some time to feel welcomed, and every couple of weeks something would happen and I would get berated for something, which also hurt. 

I eventually felt welcomed in their house, but I was still lonely. So they ask me to go to church and get to know the youth group. I go, and once again it takes me a lot of time to feel welcomed, but I eventually do, and since I was a junior at that point in time, I eventually become one of the senior guys in the youth group, and a lot of people loved having me around. I got really close with the other senior guys, who id all known from a long time ago, but was just getting to know closely. 

I should also mention that I did band in junior high, and marching band all throughout high school. I made some pretty good friends, but I also always felt excluded by my band friends. (I'd hear that they would go out to lunch and not invite me, go to parties and not invite me, etc.) But for the most part, i was being held together. I gained seniority in the band, and became a leader. All of the clarinets loved me, and liked having me in the section. (A lot of them even had crushes on me.) 

So I just start to make some pretty good friend groups, but here's the thing. I still felt lonely. All the time. I couldn't shake the feeling of depression (I was eventually diagnosed with MDD and GAD) even though I was with people EVERY SINGLE DAY. Oh well, at least I still saw people every da- BAM. COVID happens. Welp, I'm now a hermit. That five month summer was terrible. I lost so many friends, and got into one of the worst ruts of depression in my life. Almost killed myself multiple times. Then we get out of it, except in masks, and some people are doing school virtually, so that really helped me feel extremely isolated in general too. Thanks, china. 

So then it's senior year, I ask two girls out, get rejected both times, have terrible self esteem, then get asked on two dates, had a good time, but nothing came out of it. I get quarantined because my sister had gotten covid, and I went into another horrible rut of depression. When I got back, it seemed like no one even noticed that I had left. 

My school started to slip, and one of my teachers who I really respect started talking to me about it. I didn't really go into details but she let me make up all the work that I didn't do. I never got around to it by the way. 

I almost failed my calculus class just because I couldn't make myself do the homework. Getting out of bed was a big enough struggle. Hell, staying alive was a big enough struggle. I eventually graduate by the skin of my teeth and leave that world behind for good. 

Now I'm in college. I started doing ROTC, but dropped it because it was too much on my mental health. I now play guitar for the Baptist campus ministry here at my school. And it's great, but it's once a week. And I feel like even those connections arent meaningful. I don't have any ride or die friends at all, and I eat alone. I walk alone. I am alone. My roommate is never home, he's always with his girlfriend. The people in my hall do stuff without me because I have an Android and they don't want to deal with that (?). I've gotten professional help before, but it's always CBT, and journaling. And medicine. And it works for a couple weeks, but what happens when I go into another rut of depression and can't even keep my room clean, or eat? 

Everyone else has friends. I don't. And I can't keep living like this anymore."

I do not find much joy from work, felt like I was told that being an adult with a dream job would be the best part of my life, but that doesn’t feel true. I have adhd, anxiety and depression. Adhd was only treated with medicine when I was younger. Anxiety and depression was treated a bit with light medication in highschool. Now that I’m working, I either get stressed to the point of an anxiety attack or now I’m just really depressed. Get a feeling in my upper stomach, right above the belly button. Once I started this job, got a therapist I see every week and a psychiatrist for medicine. They have helped a bit, but I’m still really depressed. I wake up and just do not feel like getting out of bed, even though I can’t fall back to sleep. This feeling won’t go away until I hang with friends, but I can’t do that all the time. I dunno, I feel like something is missing, the key to my happiness.

I was born in a Colombian slum in 2005, and I was born to a barber (my mum) and a vigilante (my dad). My dad went around the streets of Cali (that was the city we lived in) at night, making sure that women weren’t being raped and catcalled. One Sunday morning, I found out that my dad had been shot dead, whilst attempting to save a woman from being raped. Ever since then, me, my mum, and my 3 sisters have moved all around Europe. We started off in Napoli, then to Charleroi, then back to Napoli, and eventually to Newcastle (where we live now). I’m so scared that one day, one of my sisters is going to get raped, and I sometimes cry at night, at the thought of it. I’m the older brother, so that might explain why I’m so protective of them, but it still hurts knowing that it might one day happen to them. On top of all that, I get stressed out about school and homework, and have self-harmed over it. Thank you for your time"

Forever_Lonewolf,2021-10-11 16:42:54+00:00,Need advice! How to find work when depressed.,"I (28yo m) had a job interview today. I feel bad about it, I don't think I have the job.

My family tells me not to underestimate myself and to apply for a good job. But I'm afraid, I don't believe myself, I'd rather go for worse job.

I recently dropped out of bachelor's studies, got to my final exams, but then I didn't go to them. I felt like I don't deserve it, so I gave up.

I think I'm depressed. I do not know what to do. I tried a psychologist but it didn't help. I would rather give up everything.

But death is not a possibility, I do not want to destroy other people's lives, it is enough that I destroy my own life.

I try to look normal, act normal, but it is so hard to be like that. They may think that I am ok and hire me but than what?"
WasteOfOrganicMatter,2021-10-11 15:59:06+00:00,Another pointless rant about whats on my mind today,"Somebody called me an attention whore the other day. Then over the weekend someone made some comments about how I need validation and affection from others in order to feel even remotely worthy. I guess all of it’s true, which brings us to the question of what can be done about it. I’ve got this idea in my head of things that could happen that would change how I feel about myself. But I think in actuality those are just pipe dreams. They won’t happen and even if they did I doubt it would really change anything for me. Or perhaps thats just me trying to protect myself from the reality that they won’t ever happen.   
 

Its always amusing to me when people make comments about how I have the power to change how I look. Granted I could lose weight and that might help a little bit, but all it would do is take me from a 3/10 back to a 4.5/10. I used to post myself on the r/rateme to try and get an idea for how attractive people thought I was. I’d wear my nicest clothes and get rated around 4 or 4.5 on average. I can’t even imagine what would get now. Probably closer to a 2. But thats okay right, looks are totally subjective and aren’t at all the measure of an individuals worth. Unless you live in a society where if you lack generally pleasing aesthetics and any real skills or talent. Then it just becomes one of many areas where you are lacking. I have to stare at my own face throughout the day when I get on video calls with clients and even though I can hide the image, it still pops up by default when I join a room.  
 

Fuck everything."

For the past 1,5 years my life has gone downhill, and now I find myself dealing with quite a lot of problems on a daily basis (**excessive overthinking and overanalyzing, negative thoughts i can't control, feeling awkward, feeling like i have no social skills (especially not with girls), not liking myself, being hard on myself**).

I used to be so much more happy and confident when i was younger. Now I overthink everything, and feel like I'm ""missing"" something socially. I don't really like my personality, and everyday i have to get myself worked up and remember things like: **""just look confident"", ""your friends do love you, remember that"", ""you are not your thoughts"", ""your mind is tricking you"", ""forget the past"", ""remember to be positive and love yourself""** etc. etc. 

Often i don't really want to get out of bed, what is there to enjoy when I overthink every single social encounter i have?

Basically, I'm just so so tired of being unhappy and not being satisfied with myself socially, and I genuinely don't know how to get better. I have tried so many things. **So i just wanted to hear if anybody had any tips or stories they would like to share, or simply just feel the same way.**"

my life is not as bad as compared to others but i still feel like it’s bad and i feel guilty about it.
i had a decent day until a minor inconvenience and now i feel destroyed and just very low; and i can’t help but notice how little the people who hurt me/my family care about it. 
i really don’t think they notice the bad state i’m in. they just think i’m a crybaby because i miss my friends. 
that’s not the reason for my depression or my state at all. it goes way back. i don’t even want people to care, i just want them to respect me and be aware that i’m fragile.
fuck i feel so stupid because people have been in way worse experiences than me, i’m sorry but i still feel like shit.
no it’s not because of my “friends” or because i have a bad perception of myself, etc etc.... it’s just because i used to be so happy and innocent when i was a kid and i have let down that girl... i wish i could go back to those times.
i’m not blaming anyone else, just myself... i just want to be brave enough to finish everything but years have passed and i still can’t be able to do it, but every little thing really crumbles me."

I'm turning 30 in a year and change and i have done exactly nothing with that.

HonestAd9686,2021-10-10 22:09:00+00:00,Is something wrong with me or is this not normal?,"So,I'm like an average 17 teen year old but with a select few differences 

My biological father is dead
I never truly met him since he was abusive towards me and my mom 
Like he called me a toy to his friends 
He ended up shooting himself with a gun Later in 2014
After they divorced 
Then my mom got with a different guy which is the dad I have now he's been in my life since i was three 

Anyways I have felt as I've been judged everyone else has a normal life and what not it seems around me 

Cause all my dad does is buy me things and doesn't want to talk to me or my brother but he loves to play games with my younger sister
And When we do try to he tells us to go away and sometimes gets mean and says things 
Also if i call him out with unfair things he gets rude and used to get aggressive and said things like you'll never get anywhere in life,and I'm a bitch,and a lot of worse things too,it's gotten physical before but it is less often then it used to since my mom got involved 

Also if i have a different opinion he tries to argue with me about it or lessen it or if I do something differently then he would say it's dumb or try to say logically this is why it's wrong
Then I don't know if it's out of not arguing for sakes but sometimes my mom will agree with me but when my dad says he has a different opinion she changes hers and agrees with him 

I feel as im more welcomed and accepted anywhere besides my home cause no one else has done this to me 
So I care about him but despise him at the same time,is that wrong?"

Why is it that because some statistics tend towards certain aspects that I am so hated. Don’t get me wrong I see the irony in the statement. 

I just don’t get it. I can be how good of a person, yet I am so hated. 

Like the premise of the idea that someone is worthy just escapes me. There is no point in trying to love people if in return hatred, anger and bias destroys us.

houjous,2021-10-10 03:52:24+00:00,It seems my rant is to much,"/r/depression blocked this but I need to vent so lets see if I can get banned on 2 subreddits:   


 

the interesting thing about medication is after a few years of trying to find the right fit for me (still ongoing) you start to see the limitations of it. once something becomes a core belief value - those things become immovable or at least very hard to change. I found a close balance for my mood and I regret to inform that my value for my own life is so arbitrarily low it's laughable. You might ask: how do you know there is no more room for improvement? Because I'm not feeling effects of depression or anxiety at a ""high"" rate as the last few days. I only get about 1 panic attack a day and my depression is only moderate compared to a few weeks ago. sleep is fine, eating is fine, I'm not spiking anxiety as much. everything feels like if I had the mindset I had going into this bout with depression I would still be in school or working. so what does this mean for me? One of two things. Scrap all the meds I'm currently taking and try again. Which would need a 5 day period between the time I take my last pill of my current medicines and when I can start new. I've done this 3 times and all of them almost killed me. or do nothing. follow the minimum guide-lines to keep the current med list going and fade away from society till my parents no longer want to hold the contract we hold and make them and the government pay me money to do nothing until I die.

I'll piss someone off with that last statement but I have to say that this check that the government gives me is around $500. If you think that's a lot...my monthly medication bill before insurance is around $2500-$3000 a month. After about $7,500 the insurance kicks over and pays 80% until I hit 10K I believe then they pay for everything. Also I'm still paying off loans from going to school back in 2011. I still owe about 4 grand. If my parents weren't as kind as they are I would need to look for housing too which is around $900-1200 in my state. Base monthly insurance costs, food, internet etc....im looking at an overhead of about 4.5k of spends a month roughly to just break even.

Side note: have you ever had to deal with people who are super empathetic...like they know your life is just awful and they choose to respond to that your still alive by saying something like ""your one of the bravest people i know,"" or ""your so much stronger than I could ever be,"" or some statement that shows signs of insight? Sounds super comforting right? Na because how much depression fucked with my mind I /only/ see it as them being sarcastic or facetious. I know they mean well but in my mind I'm just a joke to them. I know its wrong but nothing I can do about it. I'm actually more comfortable with people saying I'm garbage. I haven't been bullied since 9th grade(28 now) and since then everyone I've been in contact with has always been super nice to me. there is literally no correlation or causation for me to have those views."

We dated a little and she was my last relationship I always knew she was special and that she was the one that got away but seeing her today in her dress was absolutely amazing and completely and totally devastating. She looked so beautiful I use to dream of marrying her.. I mean that's always been what I wanted in life is a wife and kids when ask what I wanted to be as a kid the first thing that popped in my head was a father and a husband..seeing everyone happy is tearing me apart inside.. nights like tonight I wish I could just disappear.

I have an amazing boyfriend who loves me dearly, he moved in with me four months ago and it's been peachy.

I can’t. i can over come i can just do it and i really don’t want too. but they don’t want to her it they just want me to try and to stop making excuses and quitting. 
does anyone know is this is the right way to test depression? Is this what everyone says and you just power through the pain till it’s not painful anymore? I keep telling everyone that i can’t keep doing it and i’m just tired and i really don’t care and i just want to stop but they don’t let me. i feel so alone. what do  i do? I wish i could just take a pill and go back to normal. :( i’m sick of doing this. I can’t talk to my family, they don’t want to hear it. I can’t talk to my teachers, they don’t want to hear it. i can’t talk to my friends they don’t want to hear it. i can’t talk to my therapist he doesn’t want to hear it. What the literal fuck am i supposed to do? If everyone just sticks their fingers in their ears and say “i don’t want to hear you just complain if you aren’t doing anything to get better.” am i just supposed to wait till get to the end of my rope and die alone and in pain?  I understand everyone is trying to help but this can’t be the only way there has to be something other than ignoring it. It’s impossible to ignore it’s everywhere i look it’s surrounding me and it’s all i see, hear, touch, smell and taste. Its ruined everything i knew  and loved. my memory is gone my drive is gone i don’t care what happens to me and I don’t care what the fuck I do because nothing matters. I can’t kill myself but i keep thinking about how everyone would take me seriously and stop telling me to suck it up if i gave them a little scare.
 i can’t ignore it is it’s everything i am. without it  i am nothing. i am just a  hallow shell waiting for something that doesn’t exist in my current time. I’m living in hell if this even fucking counts as living. if i die i’m noting. if i live im noting. i’ll just be forever in pain like i am now. there no fucking way out i’m fucking trapped and suffocating. what do i do? i need something. i thought i would find something in therapy but  i just hit the biggest dead end since it’s all the same advice and now i really am hopeless.  pleas what do i do?"
apamlich,2021-10-09 19:04:40+00:00,I’m giving up,"I’ve been dealing with depression since I was 12 so for me suicide was always an option and unfortunately I grew up in a household where everyone was dealing with so many problems that I never mentioned anything about my dark thoughts.

Cut to now, I’m 21 and I recently(four months ago) lost my mom to cancer.she was basically the only person in my life. She was My mom, my dad, my sister and my best friend.

to be honest This time I hit a new low. 
I hardly get out of bed and when I do I just crash on the couch. I don’t do anything other than watching tv and listening to music, which is mainly bc They trigger my maladaptive daydreaming and that is the only thing that has stopped me from attempting suicide.

I visited a psychiatrist and I’m currently on an antidepressant; but it’s been almost a month and I haven’t seen any difference. I also went to therapy and My therapist recommended getting out of the house and doing things that I love and I really tried them but I can’t focus on anything good and my mind seems to only see the worst in everything.

I’ve reached a point that I’m so scared of being left alone with my thoughts. I need to be constantly watching or listening to something so I don’t think about how miserable my life is.

I don’t wanna die but at this point I don’t see any other option.

Dr1zzyGr1zzy,2021-10-09 10:56:04+00:00,how to help someone with depression.,"okay so, one of my friends is struggling with depression for the past 2 years. I had no idea that he was struggling with this issue at first but, a few months back he told me about this and I was quite shocked ngl. we are friends for a long period of time now and I had no idea that he was going through so much all this time. when I heard his side of the story all I could do was hold my tears back and just listen. he has not told this to his family because of some problems and also cannot afford any therapy or any kind of help. I told him that I am here for him at any point in life but I know all this sympathy won't help him much, I even told him that I can help him with his therapy and I actually want to do that, I cannot see him in this state and I all willing to pay or do anything for him. But all he does is deny my offers, I cannot see him like and I running out of options. I don't want him to take any dangerous step in life and I don't want to lose him. are there any other options that I can choose in order to help and get better? pls help"

I don't know what to say because it all just ends up a huge blob of text that rambles everywhere. I just wanted to post that I'm struggling really hard right now, and I'm afraid. All I want is for me to love myself, but I can't do it. I wish I was made for this life, but I feel so unequipped. I don't want to keep drowning anymore and I feel like everyone else in my life can't help me anymore. I'm so angry and scared and I just want anything that's not this. 

I know you all are struggling with the same type of baggage, so I'm not special, I just felt like maybe if I said something I would feel better.

mantraoflove,2021-10-09 07:54:16+00:00,:/ bleh,"Honestly not doing well. Im very tired of coping with life, anxiety and depression. But perhaps I can speak of something to get off my chest, albeit, the issues run much deeper than this. 

Earlier this year i had to take care of my bed ridden brother for 3 straight days. My brother had a bad reaction to something and it causes an autoimmune response that first shut his pancreas down and during the time of taking care of him for those 3 days, he couldnt stop vomiting, i had to hold the trash can for him and care for him very closely. His vomit started to be nothing but black liquid because he refused to eat and it began to tear his stomach lining up. He began to hallucinate heavily at the 1.5 day mark, which we thought was due to lack of sleep from throwing up so much. But it turns out he was going through low blood sugar and therefore keto-acidosis. After pleading to take him to the hospital for days my dad agreed to take him to the hospital. During the last 24 hours prior to taking him, he had gotten very bad. He had no idea who we were, fought us, all while disobeying all commands. He kept trying to lay on his back and then he would start trying to throw up and we’d have to grab him and aggressively pull him onto his side until he threw up on his side so he wouldnt die from getting throw up into his lungs. The morning we took him to the hospital, i had to carry his limp body to the car alone. (Dad physically cant help due to his health condition). 

A bit Later that day I got a call saying that my brother had died as soon as he got into the emergency room…his heart had stopped and after using the defib paddles for close to 10 minutes, they brought him back to life. He almost died over a dozen times that day. We were told he was likely completely brain dead and would die that afternoon. I told my brother goodbye that day, thinking that he was gone forever, due to the doctor’s prognosis. 

As a last chance to save him, He was flown via helicopter to a specialty hospital and after over a dozen surgeries and 8 million dollars in medical bills, my brother somehow survived, now being a literal walking miracle that dozens of doctors still cant explain, as so many systems in his body had shut down and stayed that way for weeks. 

He somehow came back with just diabetes and minor brain damage. Yet gratitude is hard for me to find. Sometimes i think to the black vomit and having to literally save his life dozens of times from himself (due to vomiting while laying on his back) to the point of complete physical and mental exhaustion, I dont even remember it all because it was constantly back and forth taking shifts with my dad. Its all, like a weird trip that never happened…but it did. I wish I could feel grateful that he is back. But i am just a damaged person (prior to any of this) and now i am more hurt than ever. Life keeps throwing me more and more damage and its hard to keep taking such heavy blows to the head. Ive already lost so many loved ones…this tease of death honestly hurt the most though"
marie31xo,2021-10-09 07:49:39+00:00,Totally drained,"It is crazy how being so depressed and emotionally upset can literally drain the life from you. I hate to admit it because I fear that people will think I’m crazy, but I feel actually dead inside. Just going through life like a zombie. I am so exhausted from being so sad that it’s turned me numb. It’s a wild concept to think about …. how feeling so much turns into feeling absolutely nothing. Really over going through this cycle of feeling all the feelings to feeling absolutely nothing. I sincerely hope this is not how my whole life is going to be."
Dreamville_Chris,2021-10-09 05:50:59+00:00,I need to vent,"Hey everyone, I’m Chris. I don’t usually talk about things like this but I’ve just been feeling really down recently. It’s usual for me. Aside from one really good friend, I don’t really have anyone else to talk to. College has been really stressful, got issues with parents, and still dealing with a breakup that happened over a year ago. It sounds silly but I dated that person for many years and we broke up last year on not so good terms. This person is still constantly in my thoughts and dreams. I miss her but she’s moved on. I just feel so alone. I have no other friends aside from that one friend but I know that sooner rather than later, they won’t be here because they’ll have to live their life. And then what’s next for me? I don’t know. I felt like I haven’t accomplished anything aside from constantly being sad and angry. I’m still trying to find myself as a person, heal from all the pain and loss I’ve experienced throughout my life, and become a better person overall. But it’s getting to a point where I don’t know if I can keep going. I really have no motivation to keep pushing through. I don’t even know what I really want to do with my life. I just want to be happy. I want to start by making some friends. Even if they are online friends. I just don’t want to feel so alone anymore. 

If you took the time to read all that, thank you so much. I appreciate that. If any of you want to talk about anything, I’m here. Have a great night everyone :) ."

Im not super old i would very much appreciate it if someone could talk to me a bit"
OmgChimps,2021-10-09 02:57:49+00:00,I cried for hours today,"I don't expect anyone to ever read these, spend your time with someone who matters.

I feel so alone, I can't open up to anyone because the real me isn't worth loving.

Cleaned while crying but now this space feels empty without the clutter.

Going on what feels like 20 years of just never being good enough.

I'm not a good enough son, grandson, brother, uncle, lover, nephew.

Everyday I feel like punching something until I break both my hands while screaming. Maybe I should do it.

Debating on getting a new phone just abandon my friends and family, they'd be better without me anyway.

I don't want my depression to control me, but everytime I do a little better I encounter more obstacles.

The few things I find joy in are slowly fading, I feel like I'm about to destroy all my possessions.

I need to quit my job, I love it but it's destroying my mental health. 

Sleep is hard too, lights on helps, noise helps, I'm afraid of the silence. Sometimes I wake up in a panic of where or who I am.

I'm too scared to tell anyone I think my memory is failing, sometimes I forget where I am or who I am.

Now I'm crying again."

Throwaway_69999,2021-10-08 22:01:16+00:00,"I think my girl could be cheating on me, and I feel like shit for not trusting her","Alright so basically. Me n my gf have been together for 2 years and there has never rlly been anything other than one break up which kinda was a fuckin' mess but it doesn't rlly matter. But here's the problem, so she's rlly good friends with this one guy, which i'm also pretty good friends with. They've been neighbours for like fuckin' 13 years or sum i don't remember but ""recently"" he moved away. So i mean of course they're close, and i've always known that. But i don't know at what point i should say stop, or like- do something. Like sometimes she will literaly forget abt me (not rlly, but that's what it feels like) and only talk to him for an entire day basicaly. yk she'll laugh at his jokes loud as fuck, and she'll like walk wit him n shii. And i'm a very insecure n overthinking type of person so it makes my anxiety go fuckin' crazy and sometimes i just can't handle it. But the thing that made me come here and ask for help is bc i just got home from a 5 day trip/vacation with my entire class (gf n friend included ofc) and i feel like everything got worse and better at the same time. The first day went okay ig. There were SOME things like them walking together for like a mile or two while i was walking all alone. Which made me rlly depressed bc i could just see them up there having fun while i'm back there with a full anxiety attack. There were some other things i don't rlly remember but i know there's something else. But yeah, the 2nd day is where i kinda got rlly fuckin' mad. Basicaly that day we were just ridin' around, taking pitstops. Walking around, seeing stuff. Yk the usual shit. But holy fuck this day took a turn for the worse lmao. The weather was gonna be shit (full rain all day). So basically we needed to walk a mile or two (again) to get to this like fuckin' stone farming stuff, yk, yeah. And i was having fun, yk, Doing stupid shit, jokin' around. I was having an O.K day at this point. We got some stuff explained to us first, and then we needed to do some stuff ourselfes. basicaly we got some hammers n we needed to break sum rocks n stuff, it was kinda weird tbh, but whatever. But while i was preparing n stuff i see (out of the corner of my eye). My friends walking wit his FUCKIN' ARM AROUND HER. I legit froze, everything just didn't make sense. Anxiety came, and it stayed. Oh it stayed. Man i was fucking mad, i wanted to break sum shit so that's what i did. I tried to avoid her, and show her that i was. Yk mayb she would pick up on the pieces, and think. ""oh shit, that wasnt good"" but yh, i tried to ignore her, and just try to be happy. And it worked.. alright ig, yk the entire time my friends was just wit her most of the time and it just didn't make sense man. But yh i was okay until we started walking again. Yk bc i began to have some time for myself, and then the anxiety came.. HOLY FUCK, it came harder than ever. I couldn't smile, i couldn't do shit. Man i was fucked up, was she cheating on me? is she a cheater? and in reality i kinda realised.. Oh shit i don't trust her. (BTW at this point she didn't know abt my problems wit anxiety n depression. She knew that i've had it in the past 'cause she saved me from killing myself like 6 months ago or sum, but i guess she didn't think i still dealt with it. But i do, i rlly do) But yeah, i wasn't happy, and now we needed to walk even more, like we still had fuckin' 3 hours ahead of us. 3 hours of hell and pain. It was raining, i was depressed n full of anxiety. It was just bad yk. But yh i just stayed mad n shii for like 2 hours untill we made it inside again. Where i saw something that made it worse. She was like holding his hand n stuff, and just NOT talking to me. At all. Then we made it outside again where we needed to wait for the bus for like fuckin' 30 min or something (made it even worse) But then like in the last 5 min of waiting i see him (my friend) jumping on her FUCKING BACK. Like she was carrying him, what the fuck. Like bro literaly my best friend came up to me n was like ""yo u seen that? It seems like she's rlly into him yk, laughing at all his jokes n stuff. Kinda sus don't u think?"" And yk, i agreed. 100%. But yeah, we came home. The bus ride was horrible. I was in pain, and when i came home i just couldn't take it anymore, so i texted her. ""yo what the fuck is going in between you n [insert name here]"" as u can tell i was MAD haha. And as u can expect she said. ""he's just a friend"" OMG stfu, i know he's prob more than that rn. In the end she apologized and said she would stop talking to him that much, i was happy (ish). And the rest of the day we just had fun kissing, cuddling. Whatever the fuck happend i don't remember. Then the next day rolled around, honestly the worse day of 'em all. And belive me when i say this. She lied, she fuckin' lied. She ain't talk to 'em less. Oh hell na it's still like normal. Walkin' around, having fun, yk making me get anxiety n stuff. The thing that made this day the worse is bc basically we both had these bracelts made for us both with the others name on it, but mine broke. And i felt like shit, i legit felt like a fuckin' asshole. At dinner i just kinda didn't talk, and tried to hide my wrist. After dinner i got ""forced"" into the girls shed where they were just watching some series n playing truth or dare. But i just sat in the corner with my phone... Mad, depressed, anxiety filled. The usual. I think it was all the stuff combined that just made it that much worse this time. And yk i'm a very active person, i talk much, joke much, and so on. So i knew that she def noticed me just sat in the corner on my phone completly stonefaced, not laughing. No reaction what so ever. After like 45 minutes everyone wanted to go outside. I didn't wanna go, but ofc my gf came over to me n was like ""come"". Bru i couldn't say no, so i went. But at some point when we were walking to the place we were going i just said ""na fuck this"" because i felt tears coming, and i just couldn't take it anymore. So i turned around, and left. I sat down at some random wall and broke down. Full of tears, and i never cry, trust me. Before that i hadn't cried in like 6 months so like- yeah, haha. Man i was sad as shit. Everything just came to me at the same time. Depression, anxiety, my gf. EVERYTHING. After like a good 15 minutes i decided to walk into my shed n just.. chill. But ofc the door was locked, so i couldn't. I walked like- kinda the way over to where the others were, but not rlly. But the i was my gf, she was looking for me. I was ""fuck this"" hood down, and walked away, but na i wasn't fast enough. She came up to me n was like ""u good? y did u leave? u alright?"" I just stonefaced the entire conversation. I lied, but i'm pretty sure she knew. Actually i know she knew bc she told me later, but whatever. I walked away again n after sum time i went into my own shed again 'cause i knew some of my boys were in there. Eventually they cheered me up, they didn't know what had happend but they knew sum was wrong. After some time the girls began coming n asking for me bc idfk. They didn't say (at the time) but they stood by my side n just said ""i need a good reason"" spoiler alert: they couldn't tell them one, so yeah they left. They said seeya tmrrw, and left. But later in the night i got a message from her asking if we could meet up, i was unsure at first. But came when i realised she was like crying n shii. I found out it was bc she didn't know why i didn't trust her, why i didn't tell her what was going on. Which honestly makes sense, so i ain't gon' blame her. But yeah, i told her ALMOST everything that was going on. The one thing i didn't say was that i was still worried abt her n my friend. 'cause yk i didn't wanna seem jealous. But yeah after that we said goodnight n went back to each of our sheds. The next day was ight, Me n the the boys went for a morning swin in the pool (we had like rented it) and then we went on da bus. Went for a couple of pitstops, n then went to this lil' city there was. Yk I had alot of fun, nothing rlly happend. And it was good, it was fun yk. I had fun. And the entire night was rllly good Aswell. That night we snuck out for like only 10 min 'cause she got cold so we went inside again. The next day was tday, the day where I'm writing this. Just so you know. But yh this entire has just consisted of getting home. So riding busses, boats n fuckin' trains lmfao. I got sum anxiety n stuff tday bc they were a lil' TOO close 4 my liking on the train. Yk again they were like touching hands, she had her legs chilling on him. And it seemed like they had some sort of special connection, but whatever I guess. i'm just kinda worried, what do I do? Cause this girl brings me to my lowest, but also to my highest."

A few days ago I loved life again, everything was going right, now I’m back to before thinking about worries, panicking, suicide, and drinking to get rid of these thoughts. 
It seemed like nothing could stop me but it’s just so easy to fall back into the familiarity of anxiety and negativity. I think my dads death fucked me up so much more than i thought, I’ve just been filled with so much anger at literally everything that I’m becoming a prick and a paranoid nervous wreck.

FlRacer,2021-10-08 03:04:48+00:00,I don't know who I am anymore,"I ruin everything that's good for me.

I don't even know why I came here except I'm sad all the time lately. My depression is literally ruining my life and I have no one to tell. Every time I think I turn a corner I end up back at square one. I'm so sick of this bullshit cycle. 

I do good, I have good weeks then all in a few hours it'll come crashing down. One thing will snowball to another and I'm a raging depressed ass hat who has no regard for others and once I've realized that I've let myself get out of control the damage is already done leading to more depression. Tonight a small argument turned into a full out fight because I let my depression get to me and I became defensive, before I knew it I decided to argue back and the next thing I know is I'm all alone yet again with no one to listen because I'm the bad person.

I've lost all of my friends thanks to my wonderful ability to disconnect. I only have my wife, which seems selfish because at least I have someone, but I still feel so alone. It's fucking hard making friends at 29 you can be vulnerable with. I so desperately want people to talk to. Family isn't around thanks to not being able to understand depression and telling me to just suck it up.

I do the bullshit affirmations. I do all the things everyone says. I wake up everyday and tell myself it'll be a good one then just move through the day in a void. Sometimes it seems like I don't do anything at all then all the sudden it's time for bed. At least I like sleep. Sleep never lets you down and it's always there when you need it.

I miss school. I miss being stimulated with things I enjoyed like racing, the outdoors and cooking. I miss being able to control my emotions. I miss being me.

I've watched my family turn to alcohol and I desperately don't want to end up like them but when does it end? When do I have the opportunity to feel better? When do I get the chance to say today's my day? I just want to feel better. I just want one day where I do t second guess myself. One day to be proud of me. Sometimes I desperately want the occasional beer to turn into 20 just to feel something.

Probably never. It's been 29 years of crap and I've got nothing to show for it or anyone to tell about it. What's a other 29 without anyone.

I just want to be accepted. I want to be proud of myself.

I'm scared I'll always be alone and experience life and all it's wonders by myself.

If anyone reads this just be extra nice to people please. Maybe even a little selfless from time to time. Sometimes it'll help them more than you know.

funeral_crasher69,2021-10-08 02:51:57+00:00,My Meaning In Life,"This is a PA Announcement to everybody struggling to find the answer to this question, ‘what is the meaning of life?’.
FIRSTLY: Nobody has the answer, ones purpose is defined by the actions and desires of the person in question. Each person is different in this regard.
Some of you in the sporting world may be familiar with Tyson Fury, for those of you that are not I will quickly summarize Mr. Fury. 
He is the current Boxing champion of the world holding several of the world titles at this very moment. At one point he was 300lbs, an alcoholic, drug addict, and suicidal. 
Fury explained via his Instagram recently in a video dated October 5th, that materialistic items mean nothing. He has a strong point here.
When we die, nothing is ours any longer. In a way, we simply borrow all of our possessions, so do we really own anything? This raises the alternative question.
If we don’t own the very things we possess, then what do we own? Fury answered moments in time. Moments in time are all we truly own when we die. 
Since hearing this my purpose in life has been to make as many of these ‘moments’ as possible despite physical struggles such as finances or depression. 
Trying new things, embracing different forms of literature such as books, movies, and shows, as well as being a better friend/family member. 
Fury is right, all we own are the memories we have. The beautiful thing about memories is they can be made for free. 
I hope this helps, if this still doesn’t give you the encouragement you need I suggest you watch Tyson Fury inspirational videos on YouTube, he’s an incredible man and he helped me in more ways than he will ever know. Good luck guys, take care."

MafiaDonHamster,2021-10-07 12:51:42+00:00,Too drained to eat,"Idk I'm just at a complete low rn, I do take medicine and normally I combat my depression pretty well, but some days are worse than others, and obviously depending on time of taking meds, depending on sleep levels, stress factors, etc. the 'prevalence' of depressive tendencies vary. Today just so happens to be a super bad day. I don't feel suicidal per say, I'm just so fucking drained... 

I have no energy to do anything rn, my stepmother recently told me to find the willpower to will myself through that lack of energy, so I figured hey, at least if I just get anything down that'll be good. 

And I planned on that. I planned on just at minimum putting some nachos and cheese in the microwave. Super simple, right?

And yes, I'm still sitting here. I figured I gotta be able to will myself out of this, my head hurts, I'm hungry, but still.. I can't motivate myself. It should be so easy, and that just makes me feel even worse about not having energy for it, which takes even more of any energy I could've had. 

I was trying to play some games to keep my mood up earlier, but as time went on I lost engagement in those, too. Now I just want to go lay in my bed, but I'm lacking the motivation to even go there. 

My body is screaming at me for not just getting the food, since I know it also worsens the lack of energy and the bad mood to starve, but I have no surplus, I don't know how to ""just get it done"", I told myself: ""I'm gonna do it now, regardless, now I'm doing it!"" planned on it, and nothing happened. I'm still sitting here. I don't know what to do. There is candy in my room but A. my body is not at all tempted to eat that, and B. (probably also the reason for 'A.') I know that'll only give me a sugar crash, dumping pure sugar into an empty stomach will just guarantee my mood getting even worse in an hour, and probably some nausea if not vomiting.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk what to do here, idk if I'm even looking for an answer, the issue is now my brain is also going ""well does it matter? what's the point? If I'm this impossible to deal with, if I'm this incapable, wouldn't it just be easier to let me die? Why do people around me even care if I eat? I'm only burdening them, I'm wasting my family's money by being alive, I'm wasting their time and energy that could be spent on like a billion more fun things, what do I even give them in return? What's the return-investment here?"" I know they tell me I'm a person, not an investment, but growing up my mother and stepfather (I don't live with them anymore) always raised me and my siblings that way, so I feel like it still diminishes my worth that I am useless and a burden more than anything. 

Why keep me alive? 

Anyway, I'm lacking surplus so bad, but I also know that my girlfriend would be devastated without me, she's the only one I understand the motivations behind. I'm her girlfriend, of course she wants me to be alive. But my family, I don't get it. I'm replacable, I'm not the only child they have so it's not like it'll be a big deal if I disappear. But I also know that's just the depression talking...

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion I have no idea how to get myself to go make the nachos, the good thing is I'm at least set on what I want to eat, which is more than I was an hour ago, but getting it done is so hard, I don't know how to make myself do it? If anyone has anything to say that could motivate me, that would be great, and if not, that's completely fine too. If anyone wants to just like share their similar problems in the comments that's also completely fine, if no one reads this that's fine too.

VeryMentallyStable,2021-10-07 10:29:57+00:00,Why the fuck can’t I kill myself?,"Don’t know why the fuck I’m still here. I don’t know what’s stopping me from killing myself. I don’t have any fucking hope for the future or any of that shit, wouldn’t fucking care if it did get “better”, I’m fucking bored. Don’t have friends or family or any of that shit and if I did, I don’t give a shit how it’d affect anyone at this point anyway. I don’t have anything I’m living for and yet I still just can’t physically get up and kill myself. Feel like a fucking program, like I’ve been hardwired to not be able to do it. Like there’s some invisible wall in my head. Like there’s a gap in my programming between the part that wants nothing more than to die and the part that could actually make that happen.

Instead I keep writing shit like this, even though it doesn’t fucking help at all. Doing the same fucking thing over and over again, expecting a different result. There’s not point. Ain’t a fucking thing anyone can say to make me feel better. Not gonna take shrooms or smoke weed like people keep saying, done it all before, not my thing. Not gonna do any of that mindfulness shit or journaling or anything cause I’ve done it all before and it doesn’t do fuck all. Doesn’t make any fucking difference to me if other people relate to it, if I’m “not alone”. Cause I am still alone. And if I wasn’t I’d want everyone to fuck off anyway. There’s nothing I’m hoping to hear back, yet here I fucking am still, waiting for words I know don’t exist.

Wouldn’t make a shred of fucking difference if I died right now either. Maybe my mum would be “upset”, by which I mean she’d probably use it to play for sympathy and play the fucking victim as per usual. But fuck her. She doesn’t even have the right to be upset. Don’t give a shit about that. Don’t have any other family at all. Don’t have any friends either. Only ever really had one anyway, but that was years ago. Deleted all my social media and shit not long ago cause I kept posting shit that bordered on giving away how fucking awful I’m always feeling and I couldn’t stop myself from doing it. So I nuked the accounts. And not a single fucking person has made any effort at all to check in. Not one fucking person could even be bothered to fake some fucking concern. Not that I’d want any of em to contact me again anyway, I’d just tell em to fuck off and take a hint if they did. But still, woulda been kinda nice to think maybe *someone* gave even half a shit if I fucking offed myself.

I’m just so fucking bored of being alive, bored of every waking minute for as long as I can remember now just being the existential equivalent of driving a toothpick under your fingernail. There’s no good to it. Can’t remember the last time I was anything resembling happy. It’s not just a phase. Not and episode. It’s been this way for fucking years. Just fucking over it yet I still can’t break the hard-coded fucking limit in my head stopping me from putting a fucking bullet through the roof of my mouth."
deadbuttdelish91,2021-10-07 09:40:22+00:00,How to carry on? (30f uk),"I'm getting increasingly frustrated with my depression and anxiety; and it's making me question the idea of suicide more and more.

Depression started at 17 literally it was like a light switch being turned on. It Crippled me. I was studying at the time however I was left bed ridden and surrounded by my very unsupportive family, when I was out of my bed I continually banged my head against the wall begging them to let me die.

I am 30 now and the depression has been off and on for the past 13 years. I have used and abused booze and weed in the past to suppress certain feelings however the past 4 years I have been sober and on antidepressants. I have an understanding doctor and have had councelling but did not help me at all (I actually was ""dumped"" by my counceller for still feeling suicidal after 12 sessions- apparently there was no point in carrying on with the therapy) 

I feel alone, unloved and a huge financial and emotional burden on those around me. I have not worked since January this year and the past 10 months have been a foggy haze where I have felt almost frozen in time. I am currently on a waiting list for CBT however it's a long wait (I'm in the uk) which I understand, but I have no one, literally no one to talk to. I live with my partner however he has not experienced depression or been around someone with depression before so admits he doesn't know what to say or do as he doesn't understand the condition. 

I woke up this morning like, ""what is the actual point"" I feel like I'm just sat here waiting for death....each day suffering more and more. Each medication my dr puts me on doesn't seem to work and I'm anxious about the CBT because what if I don't make enough progress during my sessions and they dump me again? Then my options are absolutely nothing.

I KNOW I should feel privaliged and happy- I have a good over my head and food in the fridge BUT I do not want to carry on any more. I have no interest in continuing with my life. I wish I could just go to Switzerland and be euthanized to be honest."

Today, i worked as usual from home since the beginning of the pandemic. Each day work is demanding as usual, but i felt my mind wasn't as stabile as before and that's why i got my prescription from the psychiatrist. 

This afternoon, as i working on a simple statistical excel table, i felt my breathing was different. As i continue without giving mind to how i breathe, suddenly comes a feeling where i want to cry. Slowly its getting faster and i wants to cry even more.

I paused for a while and try to slow down and breathe deeper, then i didn't feel want to cry anymore. 

And i thought to myself, what made my body act that way? I know my mental health isn't at its best, but what thought triggers this event? I don't know

The only thing that kept me from doing it all these past years was hope that I could change my situation. As a teen it was hope that once I left home I could leave my abusive environment, in undergrad it was hope that once I finish I could have a successful career and possibly meet someone who will love me, after undergrad I felt so confused and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and almost ended it then, but then I had hope that if I got back to school I could change my career.

Now, I’m almost done with my graduate degree and I doubt I could find a job in this line of work nor do I really want to. I feel like a failure and a waste of space and worry. 

I also used to think about about my family and how they would react to losing me and that also kept me from doing it. But now I just don’t care anymore, I don’t care that they love me, I love them too and they know that. But I’m unhappy. Very unhappy. I’ve cried everyday for the past two weeks and have had no one to talk to but myself.

I just got done thinking of my plan to end everything after spending my first Christmas with my wonderful little sisters this year. I cried thinking about it, and now I’ve logged back into work but I’m shaking. My body must be scared because it knows this time it’s serious. 

I’ve tried therapy but I just don’t think it works. They don’t understand my situation and they can’t guide me through my thoughts everyday. 

I don’t know what else to do. I have no one to talk to."

I feel lonely for some reason despite having friends and family with me . I have tried everything like getting out more  often ( I’m an introvert so don’t do that much ) , studying for long periods of time , reading , hanging out with friends , video games , watching anime , etc . I really don’t get it coz I used did the same stuff like binge watching anime and Netflix and playing video games a year back and I was really happy back  then but I don’t know what’s happening now , and no I don’t feel guilty . Please someone who has had a similar experience,help me out ."

I want nothing more for it all to just stop, and I know there’s only one way for that to happen, but I can’t make it stop. If I’m gone he won’t forgive me, and that kills me. It would just be one more thing that would eat at him at night. I don’t want to do that to him. I love him. I almost wish he’d just hate me so there would be nothing holding me back, but for now I have him. So I have to deal with my shit."

Simba823,2021-10-06 15:04:59+00:00,Losing someone.,"2021 has been awful for me. I've lost 2 lifelong pets, lost friends and I've suffered romantic rejection after romantic rejection. As the year went on, I became more and more convinced that I was some monster and not a human. That I couldn't be loved by anyone  


I still believe that, but I met someone a bit ago that made me feel differently for a blip in time. It was honestly so amazing, we'd spend whole days talking and flirting. There was kissing, cuddling and hugging. They would actively seek me out everyday, always hang around.  


I loved it, made me feel human. They even kept me afloat when my dog of nearly two decades died. But I fear that's over now. They've felt colder and colder, taking longer and longer to reply to messages. Never engaging me in any kind of romantic interaction anymore.  


I hate this feeling so much. I hate watching them slip away from me and I'm powerless to stop it. I can't help but despise myself. This has been a massive reminder that I'm going to be alone and I need to learn to survive by myself. I'm just so tired of it all."

VeryMentallyStable,2021-10-06 14:48:56+00:00,Wanna rip my goddamn brain out,"Sick of having the fucking thing. Would rather be lobotomised, live like a fucking zombie, if I gotta live at all. Can’t escape a fucking thing while my brain still carries all this shit around. Can’t just “let it go” either, people say that but I don’t really know what the fuck it means, my brain doesn’t have hands. It ain’t an action I can physically take. 

Every waking fucking minute is like being trapped in a private fucking viewing of all my shittiest moments. Hell, I don’t have anything but shitty moments. Can’t look at an object in the world without being reminded of some fucked up thing I don’t wanna think about. Can’t even butter my fucking toast in the morning cause I think about a conversation I once had with a girl I used to be best friends with about how much it sucks when the butter doesn’t fully melt cause you waited too long. She was the only actual friend I’ve ever had and now we don’t talk cause I fell in love with her and she didn’t feel the same way. Been 2 years since I saw her last, don’t know why the fuck I still think about her. But I still can’t put butter in fucking bread without feeling like I gotta throw it across the room. 

My whole head’s just shitty memories like that. Fucking thing insists and remembering every little mundane fucking thing to associate it all with too, like fucking butter on bread. Can’t escape it. Just wanna be dead or asleep or just so zonked out I’m not even really here. Wanna just wipe the fucking thing and start again.

Won’t even let me just “live”, least not in most people’s sense of the word. Can’t be around people cause… well shit, don’t even know how to fully explain it, other than to say it just doesn’t work. Doesn’t feel right. Like I’m missing a piece that I’m supposed to have to be able to feel connected or whatever. I hate it. Hate being around people. Makes me wanna be alone. Don’t even think I see a reason to try anymore anyway. Don’t want another “friend”. Definitely don’t want a girlfriend or any of that shit anymore either. So I guess there’s nothing I want from people at this point. And without em, I might be fucking lonely, but at this point, think I’m more lonely with em.

Can’t fix this shit. Medication doesn’t help. Been trying for years to find the “right mix” like people say, but none of them do a fucking thing. Same with therapy. Doesn’t matter with one I try, DBT, CBT, EMDR, doesn’t matter how much I “click” with my therapist, none of them have helped with anything. Just wanna be brain dead. Or real dead. Don’t fucking enjoy anything anymore anyway. Don’t have those “little moments” here and there, don’t have anything but fucking suffering. Been like this for so long I just want it to fucking end."

dejael,2021-10-06 06:11:04+00:00,This is hard.,"Its hard finding a reason to keep going. It feels like Im doing everything wrong or that Im too slow or too far behind where I should be. I literally dont even know what I like anymore. Im numb to everything. Life has evolved into a set of flashcards, reshuffling over and over again. Nothing is new anymore. 

Not to mention social connections and stuff. Its so hard to stay connected to ppl you care about when you cant find life interesting anymore. They take it personally too, which really doesnt help. I dont want this to be over, I just wish I knew what to do to make life enjoyable again. All it is now is stress, stress, a bit of food, a bit of sleep, and more stress. Im truly miserable."

I've gone through this cycle where I breakdown, screaming, wailing, hitting things, crying. During the ""fit"" I feel so much pain, my heart literally hurts... I really want to ""fix"" myself, I have people in my life that I want to help, and I'm sick of wallowing in my own pity. I know I've said this to myself so many times yet I still don't act, I don't have the ""strength"" to sign up for college, to go to my doctors, ect. its putting me into a darker and deeper hole where all I'm thinking is, ""if i love these people so much why can't I bring myself to do these things? maybe i don't love them enough?"" then i beat myself up even more because i feel so disgusted with myself... I've reached out to who I thought were life-long friends, literally cried my eyes out to them about how I've been feeling and they still doing attempt to contact me, I've asked for help from people I can trust and I feel so un cared for, I know everybody is dealing with their own shit, i know life sucks for everybody so why should I feel so bad.... idk how any of this started, I do feel so much better getting this off my chest, but i want to do better for myself, we all deserve to be happy... i just want my happy back bro.."

Rachelcla93,2021-10-06 04:22:27+00:00,Just an excerpt from my journal/mind.. trigger warning,"I’m trapped in this endless hell surrounded by darkness, pain and fear. It’s an endless cycle, wake up, hurt, hate, sleep… Oh sleep! The best relief you can get. At least you would think it would be. If anything it’s just as dark, just as lonely. There your thoughts roam around as if they own the place and the only rent they pay is suffering and self-loathing. They trick and tease you promising relief, other times peace, but never happiness or hope. You just keep spiraling down your black hole, hoping for the end and only finding deeper pain. So you take your thoughts and shred into yourself seeking feeling or meaning and finding nothing but a darker hole. Others blanche away when they see the scars not wanting to feel uncomfortable for a minuscule moment, not wanting any part of you. You’re broken, why would they? So you jump back into the hole falling deeper and deeper, waiting for it to end. You think at the bottom of the hole there’ll be two doors. One offering the sweet relief of nothing more. No more pain, no more sadness, no more hatred. The other is unknown but most likely a dead end or deeper hole. The scariest part of the black hole you’re in is eventually you stop trying to escape and just accept the singularity of your life; depression."
Own-Marzipan-6416,2021-10-06 04:03:36+00:00,"rant: lonely, lost &amp; giving up","every month things just get worse and worse and worse and i can’t even see myself finishing this year, let alone going into 2022 and having to live through another year. My ex was my best friend in the whole world and we weren’t even together for that long, and it’s been longer now without him that than we were even together for, but i still wake up almost every single day in shock and denial. I Had very few other good friends before I met him but no one I ever felt nearly as close to or comfortable with as a friend and Now I cant connect to my old friends the way I used to anymore and I cant trust ANYONE. The only 2 people i still like talking to are in college on the other side of the country and I’ve tried making new friends on bumble bff and talking to new guys and i’ve gone on a few dates but I just feel so uncomfortable and out of place being with anyone else, platonically or romantically. I want friends SO SO BADLY but I cant connect with anyone and I have no interest in anything anymore. I spend every free second i’m not working laying in bed mindlessly on my phone or watching the same show on netflix over and over or just silently staring the wall just trying not to lose my mind, and when I cant control it i go sit alone in a parking garage in my car and cry and scream for hours on end so my family doesn’t hear me. I love my job but I cant handle interacting with other people or having legitimate responsibilities and I spend all my breaks crying in the bathroom or my car. My ex emotionally encouraged and supported me so much throughout school and picking my major &amp; throughout the semester I was with him I got the best grades i’ve ever gotten In my entire life, Now i don’t even have the motivation to sign up for classes let alone actually take a class and do work for it, I only have a few semesters left but everything about this degree just makes me think of him and I don’t know what to do with my life at all anymore. I cant get a therapist or any kind of medicine (It’s a long story i’m not even gonna get into) because of my narcissistic and invasive parents who’s insurance plan i’m still under and I’ve been using CBD/THC for years to try to help but it’s just created a terrible dependency issue for me that’s sinking me down in so many ways and i’m trying to just take a break from it for a few weeks rn for financial and tolerance reasons but It’s so hard and im just hitting empty carts all day hoping to feel ANYTHING. I think about ending my life literally all the time but as of now I Don’t think I would actually do it because I lost a friend that way and we weren’t even that close but It was still very traumatic and I don’t want to hurt other people even though I know It won’t matter to me when i’m gone. I wake up every single day and cry knowing i’m just going to live the same day over and over again and i’m so lost and so hopeless. No matter what I do or how hard I try to move on or do something with my life It just pulls me further back into this dark place."

Wife was the breadwinner I was the stay at home dad, now I have nothing now that she's left me, and that's more on me than anything else. 
But I'm at the end of my rope, I've been depressed for 2 years with lost of self harm thrown in to boot. I have no luck with women, can't support my kids, no friends or family to talk to, and all I can think after all the stupidty that is my life is to end it.

MysteryGirl1122,2021-10-06 02:06:05+00:00,How I’m feeling,"I just joined to but I don’t know exactly where else to put my words on how I’m feeling as try to make sense of it.

Every day, I wake up earlier then the last and each day I have the hopes of going back to sleep but those hopes never come true. I look down as I walk by the mirrors in my room and think how I’m barely worth the toothpaste that I’d brush my teeth, so I just don’t. I cant decide where I should be, in my bed but I’m too awake for sleep or to be up but I’m too tired to function. I use my time to do school to get the check mark on my grade book, I work to pay bills, and I fill my life with filler people.

You might ask what are filler people, but those people Are people who allow the clock tick faster and just make the end of my misery seem that much closer. 

I never can decide if I should eat because I’m bored or not eat so I can be skinny like those girls on Pinterest that I know my body structure will simply not allow. I try to think about working out but the thought of leaving my room in my new town makes me cringe and the action of working out never motivated me. Before I know, I’ve sat on my bed going through the spirals of watching tiktok or thinking about my purpose as I feel I’m reaching for nothing…..

I hope this isn’t triggering for anyone as these are just my feelings. If there is any advice… please feel free to comment"

Its just funny coz a few days ago i actually thought im finally getting better but man was i wrong. While It did dwindle a little then, it's now back a million times worse. I know im a coward and there's no way i could do the do but part of me wants to write the letters... just in case. You know.. now that i think about, it, i'm a simple person. I don't ask for much, i don't pray for anything grand, I only wish to be left alone and allowed to live in peace but even that seems impossible. I thought of running away from everyone but where do i start? Would that even make any differences? I feel like the sadness, wherever i go, they would follow me. No matter how fast i run, they always seem to catch up. I am tired. Mum, dad, gran, everyone, i am tired. I know my sobs are quiet but if you would just look closely, my eyes are practically screaming in pain. Tired of all the hate being thrown everywhere, tired of fake love, tired of faking happiness, tired of just everything, i wish i could just end it. I know, i don't have the right to utter these words as i don't do anything much around the house or anywhere but i am truly extremely tired. Idk tho. Im confused. Am i really what i think i am? Or am i doing this to potentially get everyone's attention? Am i a sad addict? I dont know anymore. I wish everything would just stop. I just wanna have a quiet moment. That's it. Nothing else.

Nousername902,2021-10-06 00:35:00+00:00,Just need to type into the void,"Almost 10 years ago I tore my ACL (completely), MCL, and LCL while trying to lose weight to join the military. First surgery tried to fix everything but ultimately failed. Screw broke and had to be removed after a year which became so painful I had to go back to crutches before the second surgery to remove it. After the surgery I found out the ACL from the cadaver never fully healed to my body, it was very red when it should have been white. The screw was broken in a way that a portion is still in my knee because removing it could have cause it to break through the rest of the bone possibly piercing my artery or central nervous system. The doctor I had told me “you might have a case for medical malpractice but you will never hear me say this again” (he wouldn’t speak about it again because he and the first surgeon worked in the same union and about to retire. no other doctor would speak on it because they ‘didn’t have enough information’) the surgeon told me my acl was in such bad shape that if I had a third surgery I would likely need an additional one just for a bone graph. Later my knee got really painful again and started giving out randomly. Eventually I saw a more highly accomplished surgeon (was known for being recommended for Ravens players) he said he was very confident he could do the repairs without a bone graph, I was happy considering that would be one less surgery….. that was two years ago…. All of this was on my left knee. Now it’s been in pain so much and so often that the limp is causing immense pain in my right knee, left ankle, and back. I’m a welder so my job isn’t easy on my body either, and this is all I know as a profession…. I’m so tired of going to work and coming back in so much pain that I can’t do what I need to let alone any hobby I want to do. I’m tired of using vacation time just to cover days that I’m just in too much pain to work. My job doesn’t offer short term disability so I don’t even know if I could afford another surgery. At this point I just wish something would cause an amputation of both my worthless legs. I used to love going to a paintball field, I was pretty good at swimming, I was able to squat 400 lbs. I’m. Just. So. Fucking. Tired of having to go to a job just to go home and “heal” in just enough time to hobble to work. To get used. To get to a workable shape. To get used. To get to a workable condition. To get ground down. To just waste life. To resent every god damn thing."

Noodle4DaysBoi62,2021-10-05 23:25:27+00:00,Am I getting better?,"Hey, the first post I make on reddit is this. The irony lol.

I got diagnosed for mild depression and my parents were shocked. 

And they made me try some things that could help me get over it. Like:

- My dad taking me on drives where we just listen to music and he drives 
- Taking vitamin c and d tablets (the doctor told me to)
- Eating healthier in general
- And talking about my feelings more to them

I got better for a month, but then my dad stopped asking me how I felt. I don't feel comfortable talking to my dad about my feelings cause, well, there's just a lot. I'm closer with my mom I guess. We all have very different opinions on stuff.
So my dad stopped asking me how I felt probably cause he got busier cause of work. And I don't know how to just, speak. 

I self harmed before for a day. It was like 8 cuts, and they were just scratches anways. So it wasn't that big of a deal. I want to do it again today. 

I also want to go to therapy but at the same time I don't. My parents don't want to take me there. And they are still very paranoid about COVID. Idk. I'm really scared haha. Im getting anxious while writing this."

She sees the world in black and white,
She wishes she could see in color,
She can't find her way,
No matter how hard she tries,
This demon inside, 
It eats her alive,
She hurts those she loves,
And they will never understand, 
Her explanations are just out of hand,
The world will laugh, and maybe cry,
But this girl you see,
With brown hair and blue eyes,
She's so broken and damaged,
That she's still surprised, 
She has the breath to keep her alive."
Zacharius10,2021-10-05 14:15:00+00:00,My struggles with depression and self harm.,"My ex girlfriend dumped me on Valentine’s Day this year. I was already depressed at the time and she knew, she knew about my horrible relationship with my dad and how I had suicidal thoughts at times, especially after one of my best friends took his life late 2019.
After we broke up we were still friends, that was up until she started posting about how she hates Sagittarius men (I’m a Sagittarius), and completely mindfucking me.
She would call me and want to talk to me and then treat me like shit next minute.
I blocked her at the time after a huge argument because she practically hated me and pushed me away when I hadn’t done anything wrong.
Fast forward throughout the year she would randomly call me and text me, but when I would calmly ask her about why she hated me, she would get aggravated and shut me down.
She called me one time when she was going on a date with some guy, and said “Zac I think I’ve been stood up.” Then said “Oh wait don’t worry” and hung up. After this happened I relapsed again and cut myself multiple times. It just made me upset that someone I used to love so much wants to hurt me so badly.
More incidences similar to this have happened throughout the year.
She contacted me yesterday and we were talking and everything was calm, but tonight while on the phone to her I said “I know this might make you mad, but I really need closure, why did you hate me after you dumped me on Valentine’s Day?”
She started saying she didn’t want to talk about it, and I kept pleading, that I needed the closure. Because I did, after she dumped me my confidence deteriorated and I just fell into a hole of self hatred thinking I’m nothing.
She started laughing on the call while I was almost in tears at how upset it was making me, she then said “Goodbye Zac” and hung up. 
I honestly hate doing this, seeing someone I loved so much and always tried to help when she was going through times self harming and having suicidal thoughts, just completely hating me now and I don’t know why, and just constantly treating me like shit.
I honestly want it all to stop I feel so worthless."

I'm like generally pretty happy. But lately I've been struggling pretty hard. In March, my aunt killed herself. She drowned herself. It has been a big shock. I never knew she felt like that at all. No clue whatsoever. She was always happy when she was around me. I legit had never seen her even remotely sad. I have talked to my dr about it and got prescribed anti-depressants.. which deff help with the little moments where I feel it spiking and then the meds deff cut it off..  but then I have these bigger spikes where I can't control it and I start crying..

CloudOcty,2021-10-05 06:14:23+00:00,Doing everything wrong with my gf,"Hello, first of all sorry if my english isn't perfect.
I'm 22yo

I Need to explain why I am sad because I can't take it anymore.

I was with a toxic girl for 3y distance relationship, I knew I didn't really loved her but I was unable to break up, I was afraid of what will happening after. After finishing my degree I travelled to her place and we found a house where we lived for.. 3 weeks, After I break up with her because I had the force.
While I was with her, I saw an old friend (A girl I'll call C for this post) where we had a good time but we were too ""friends"". My ex discovered it and was angry but asked me to tell her I didn't loved C. It hurts me because I'm someone who hates hurting people. 
But even if I had to stop talking with C, I hide it to my ex but later she discovered again. After that she said "" it's Me or C, even if you love me, I don't want you talk with her""
She was toxic because not only C had this, all my friends and family were "" toxic"" and tried to make me lose all of it 

Anyways, after I break up with my ex, I talked again with C, I was afraid she didn't wants to talk me anymore but she accepted, I called her and I we talked for an hour and laugh after 2 years without talking. 

After some months of talking, I said I loved her and her response was the same as my sentence. I was so happy but the begin of the screwing up began.

We were in a distance relationship, the 1st quarantine in France began, we talked all day and night I was really happy. But after I saw her 2w in my house, I went 1w in her house but after that, I did a party with a friend and I meet another girl, which I.. cheated my gf with her..
I would do a surprise to my gf by going to her home without telling her but in my trip, I needed a place because my train was the next day. I slept with the girl but when I asked her at the begin, I wouldn't cheated my GF.
Irony isn't it ? I cheated my gf while I was going to do her a surprise

We did a week not really good with my gf, I didn't tell her but after I left her home, I start talking again with the other girl. We were really close to the other one. Back in my home, I talked in priority to the other girl
Next month, 2nd quarantine and C discovered I cheated her. She asked me to tell her everything but I lied to some points, and after she asked me to tell Her I don't want to talk with the other girl anymore.

The same thing as when I was with my ex.. but this, It was my wish, I didn't want to break with C
After this, C went to her home and the next month I gifted the other girl by my friend's help a little piece of something that's makes us laugh. And I called her to explain I love C, not her but I was too good and not enough direct.

After that, I went in my GF house, we took a bigger apartment and everything was perfect even if sometimes she was afraid I talk again with the other girl.
2days ago, my friend sent me a message to ask me where I lived for a letter with the gift that the other girl tried to send me.

I refuse, and C asked me to call the other girl for telling her to explain that I don't want her. The call was short but I wasn't enough rude.
Yesterday, my gf asked me why and when I gifted the piece. I tell her all the truth but now.. She's thinking about to break up with me. I don't want that..
I want to send another message to the other girl to tell her, I never loved her, I love C and all was a mistake but I already did that 2days ago but kindly..

I thank you for read my story, I already see a psychologist next time I see the psy is in 2w but for now, I'm afraid, really depressed and I want to finish all that story."

My half brother has been missing for 2 weeks his name is Caleb and I don’t know him the best. I was adopted when I was 5 and didn’t knew he existed until 5 years ago. The beginning of this year we connected over Facebook and I got to meet him and we’ve been close since. He has mental heath issues that make things tough but I still love my brother. He’s been missing 2 weeks yesterday and he’s not on his meds so who knows how he is, it’s been really hard into of everything else going on in my life, I just hope they find him 😢"
Franjkmetal,2021-10-05 04:28:11+00:00,My thoughts.,"Many times I thought my self, Why killing Yourself If out there are worst people living a ""life"". My point is I'm thinking that I'm a piece of shiet, just because I do nothing with my life and isolating myself. 

Many things that I want to do... I can't do it because of my fucking depression. Dude, I really hate myself for not take care of the People I love and is not because I do something wrong... Is because I just being in my room sleeping all day. I literally I'm starting not feeling emotions for other people (Like for a Relationship) 
I don't like women or men, I have like 1 year without having sex with anyone and my last sexual encounters don't even feel good anymore... Sometimes I watch porn and I just don't feel nothing is boring and meaningless, at this point actually nearly everything is meaningless. Why this frequently thought is haunted me. I'm trying to live  but all that I do is killing Time.

I have been on different jobs, and I left for the same reason. Everything is feeling empty, I don't care about buying ""stuff""... At this point I don't care if I just slowly kill myself smoking cigarettes. I feel so ashamed I don't even like the taste of cigarettes anymore I just smoke it.
Many friends are gone. I don't talk to anyone I'm slowly becoming a Socially Inept, that kinda bothers me, at this point I don't even know how to talk ""Normally"" to another human being, because I don't have anything to say. Everything is just awful, I kinda miss my childhood and all my childhood Friends are now just memories that I keep, for at least something happy to remember.

Im becoming more and more isolating everyday pass.

I have some friends... Can pass a whole month and I don't talk to anyone because my shitty mind thinks that I just bothering... So I just stay quiet. I'm pretty sure that is all my fault, I guess I need learn and accept being alone. I try to talk with them but I just have that feeling that they don't want talk to me anymore, If I don't talk first they don't even write me a message.

In very rare occasions I hang out (Individually) with 2 fiends, I can have a very good time with them playing video games etc. But then they just Disappear...

And that's basically my life right now. At least I have a medical prescription and taking my pills but I have nearly 2 years and many times I don't feel anything. 

Why I'm not just killing myself and that's it?

I have feeling that I don't want to hurt my family. But I know they don't live forever. And then, What is gonna happen? Feeling more confident to kill myself because there is no one left that I can possibly hurt. I just wanted to told you about my thoughts that I have frequently... I hope I can change my mind and not being this like this anymore. But I don't trust my own mind... I'm scared."

AuroraMaybe,2021-10-05 02:20:56+00:00,I Feel So Conflicted,"I don’t know what to do.

I never learned the skills I needed to learn to become an adult; Cook for myself or know how to properly stress for the weather, or anything. I still struggle with basic math and social skills. My mom never taught me and she was very overprotective so I hardly went out without her.

Here I am, 21 years old after her death several months ago, in a new city and thrown straight into adulthood.

They wanted to teach me to be independent, money and so much more. I am learning very basic cooking, but it’s not enough. I am learning how to manage my own money, I still need clothes for winter. I just recently quit my old job and started a new one for more hours but I’m not ready for the position I applied for due to my lack of knowledge but they’re keeping me on board so I can do other positions.

I started going out alone a few months ago, and I enjoy that freedom. I couldn’t even go down the hallway to throw out garbage without supervision back when mom was alive.

My mom was going through a court case, it was passed over to me to continue but it’s too hard for me to handle. Everyone will be angry with me for letting it go, it was her legacy.

My cousin’s fiance’s in laws recently proposed that I move in with them up north, because I haven’t learned what I was supposed to here and my cousin and her fiancé may be leaving for their work and will be gone for extended periods of time and I’m not ready to be alone yet. They think it is best for me. My cousin thinks the pets there will be good for my mental health and I’ll be helping out with the farm work.

I’m in therapy twice a month. I seen a doctor for the first time in a year for the first time last month and he immediately put me on antidepressants.

My cousin’s fiancé, I guess he’s been keeping track of how much I eat daily because my depressive state makes me not hungry as I should be, told me today that because he’ll be working soon he won’t have the time to make sure I eat and cooking for the both of us that I should find basic things to cook for myself to eat.

Is it bad that i that I agree with everything they’ve all said? I know I’m struggling, they can see that. I have trouble eating when I’m upset, and because I don’t know how to cook for myself I also struggle with that.

My mother’s first year anniversary is also coming up in a few months, I don’t want to be alone or want that month to come. December isn’t the happiest time of the year, December is the month where we were kept in the dark  of our former home and were hungry while making funeral plans for after Christmas for our mother.

I’m so conflicted with my thoughts, it feels like decisions were made without me and I am alone."

Puzzled_italian,2021-10-04 23:20:58+00:00,Depression or Munchausen,"TW - suicide


Depression runs in my family genes, I’ve lost a relative to suicide, my nana is depressed, uncle and sister too. We discovered about my sister G 3 years ago, found her crying after drinking bleach, brought her to the hospital and hoped for the best until she was diagnosed with depression and borderline disorder. It was a punch in the gut and an experience I wouldn’t wish to my worst enemy. 

One and a half years later I started to struggle in college, couldn’t bring myself to keep up with my exams, started failing but couldn’t tell my parents because they had so much in their hands with G. Things got a little better with time but then a year ago it all went shit, I was way behind with my course and started tracking my mental symptoms with an app for depression disorder (PHQ 9 test if anyone knows what it it) and I got “severely depressed” as result. But I never told anyone because I though it was a copying mechanisms and that I was trying to bring attention to myself. Now I’m feeling like shit, worse than ever and I’m scared I’ll do something to myself and, since no one knows, no one’s going to be there to stop me."
Throwaway17X54,2021-10-04 23:18:16+00:00,"Cyclical depression, hopelessness and fear","Hi,

I know what I have to say here is nothing compared to some of the posts, but I need to just write it down somewhere, regardless of anyone reading it, or helping me, I just need to say what I feel.

By way of background I’m a guy in my 30s, I am lucky in that I have a good job, a nice house, an attractive girlfriend whom I love, and a loving wider family - and to all external appearances my life is, well, perfect.

So I really acknowledge I have nothing to complain about and no reason to be depressed (if needing a reason was a thing) - and yet the spectre of cyclical downturns haunts me, I have a total inability to deal with confrontation as I am too scared I will say or do something which will get me in trouble.

My parents did an amazing job of bringing me up. However I did have negative influences in my life from a young age, my older brother was sort of a hero to me. He was in his early twenties, good looking, a body builder and night club doorman, he wasn’t a nice person and still isn’t. He is someone who warped my young life, by shaping me into someone capable of nothing more than doing an imitation of him. I pretended to be tough, I treated girls badly, I was disrespectful to my parents, and I took the values they had inculcated in me, and replaced them with the low values he had coached teenage me in, at this time I was also derided for being “gay”, mocked for the way I dress, physically assaulted on occasion (pushed around and made to feel weak), told that learning and school were “ok if you’re not a real man”, and that i “didn’t live in the real world”  - made to feel that any accomplishments I did have were valueless. I love my brother, but I also hate and blame him for this, as I am sure it set me up for what follows. 

I cut myself for the first time when I was in my teens, around 15, I wrote detailed suicide notes to my family, they found them before I could plan anything, not that I think I thought I was going to do anything, I think I was just feeling hopeless, and in a black hole of depression.  Despite all you will read (or not) this is the thing I’m most ashamed of in my life, putting my parents through having to read these.  I used anti depressants at this point but they made me seizure so I had to stop.  I was also having bad panic attacks daily at this point which were inducing vomiting. I didn’t know what the panic were at this point, I just knew that certain things in my routine  triggered me to vomit. Once I had broken the routine the panic attacks died down, they returned later in university.

At this same time I was being pressured, by my older brother to get into a career where I could make a lot of money.  I thought a lot of him, as I’ve said he was sort of a hero to teenage me, so I tried to pass science a levels and train as a dentist. I failed because it isn’t something I am natural at at all, and I was foolish to attempt it, and foolish to listen to him. I had to re do a sixth form year, and instead take arts subjects where I got A’s.

I wanted to be a writer really, and attempted a masters degree after getting a BA but another brutal bout of depression arrested me in my post grad year when I was around 22, and I simply wasn’t capable of completing it, it was another awful failure - and my morale and belief at this point was so low, from what I perceived as repeated failures of character that I again began harming and struggling to cope for a period.  I was taking large doses of codeine and co-codamol. If I could get the codeine I would do a couple of thirties, if I only had co codamol I would take 8-10 at a time to try and get some sort of relaxant effect from the codeine content. I’m not sure if it worked, or if it was just a placebo effect. I knew it was hazardous to take that amount of the drug, but I didn’t care. I tried to talk to a friend about it, she had cancer and I thought as she was suffering from a long term illness too we might find common ground here, but instead she called me pathetic. I guess that’s understandable as she was dealing with big things herself.  Again though this was another hammer blow to my esteem.

I blundered on in this for the next few years, until I got into my mid twenties, around 26, and now having trained as accountant (somehow) at the peak of my physical and mental powers I was struck down with another crushing bout of depression, this time lasting months, destroying my reputation at work “is he tough enough” and “he hasn’t got it upstairs” where things I overheard on my eventual return. This time I took razor blades to myself and put around 300 cuts on my body to the point I was bleeding out. My flat mate found me in a pool of blood and saved me, I needed stitches in several cuts, although I still think I wanted to live.  However it dealt a mortal blow to my relationship with her, my best friend at the time, and she moved out soon after. I couldn’t blame her, I was incredibly erratic at this point, cross dressing, wearing make up, and simultaneously wandering the streets of one of the most dangerous cities in the country, hoping that perhaps someone would hurt me. I don’t know what I was doing or trying to achieve looking back, I think I was just in a very awful place and dragged those around me down, desperately trying to find an identity that would keep me afloat. This bout was far more severe than previously, and there were some times I genuinely thought I would die - my arms, torso, legs, shoulders are still raked with deep scars from where I hurt myself, and people still ask me what they are. I tell them I got glassed in a pub once. I don’t think they are fooled.

In my early thirties this happened again, this was when I was making another effort at getting a graduate degree, and I had to defer several modules as I began to suffer acute symptoms. Unfortunately my employer was not very understanding and took to bullying me, which exacerbated my symptoms even further, I could feel the black swell of the depression gathering, like in a tsunami when you see the waters retreat only to know that they will return with a vengeance. This time I sought intensive counselling, again I was lucky that I was in a position to pay. Early on I was sceptical that this would work but it really did, I cut myself only a few times.  This was major progress for me, it was a real fight and I had lots of days where I felt just as bad if not worse than five years ago, but I feel like I came through it more strongly, felt that I had conquered my demons to some degree, and went on and finished the MBA I was studying, and even got a distinction. I was proud of myself for the first time in my life.

Now, I am five years on from this point and I can feel the storm clouds gathering again, sometimes the stress of life just feels like a mountain bearing down on my shoulders, I can’t sleep, sometimes when I do I have horrific nightmares, I can’t concentrate on my work, I am constantly exhausted, I am perpetually nervous, always scared, unable to process and deal with modern life, feeling directionless and adrift again - but to everyone else nothing has changed, and I’ve never felt so alone, I don’t want to drive people away again. 

Coming back to the opening paragraph, and my other fears that go hand in hand with this. It is ludicrous, I would be afraid to ask someone to move a car blocking my drive, or to turn their music down in case it escalated. For most people I guess their fear would be of being hurt, mines the opposite I worry that I will do or say something illegal, or violent and it will start a downward spiral dragging me to hell, I am living my life as if I am one misstep away from oblivion. And although this is totally irrational, to me it seems perfectly logical, and even almost inevitable, abs the pressure of this real or imagined problem is utterly crippling for me at times.  

I’ve never been passionate about my job, but when the darkness overtakes me it’s even worse, I feel completely directionless and rudderless and trapped between quitting me trying something new or sticking to what I know but don’t like. I don’t think that is uncommon for most people in fact, but couple with my other issues it puts me in a position where I feel like no decision is right, nothing I do can come out right and I become simply inert - looking round and thinking everything is hopeless which just feeds my negative feelings.

Anyway for anyone that has read to the end of this monologue, thanks! Fir anyone who didn’t make it, I don’t blame you.

Look after yourselves."

I'd despair so hard, I'd try in those three seconds to think of everything and nothing and I'd try to rearrange myself as I fell, wind and fear absolutely everywhere, to minimize the impact - a futile effort. I'd already be dead. It would be hopelessly painful and I'd be gone. That isn't what I want. I'm just sad that I always mess up."
kprincess77,2021-10-04 21:23:23+00:00,I don't know why....,"I have been depressed for years, I try to put on a happy face mask and show people that I am ""Fine"". Maybe I can fool myself to be happy again. I try listening to music, write again, right my story of my hard ships and even try to write my poetry I used to do. It made me feel better. I look at the blank paper try to put words together nothing comes. I don't know how to put how I feel on paper anymore. 

All I want to be is happy instead of the moody woman. Maybe I don't know who I am anymore. I know I got to write again but I just can't write the emotional feels I have. Maybe this is a start. 

Maybe I just need to speak to someone that is feeling the same way. Someone to talk to because I feel like I cant talk to people around me because.... they don't understand what goes on in my head."
Routine_Specific_892,2021-10-04 20:03:01+00:00,I cant cry,"

Im pretty sure im depressed ive took some online tests and they all tell me severe depression but i dont take them that serious because like i said theyre just online tests so they probably arent that accurate.

Anyways thats not my point this past week or two its gotten the best of me and i feel like complete dogshit and i have a lot of physical pains and i feel nervous and stressed out. 

Im pretty sure crying would help out a little but i just cant for some reason. I tried many things like listening to sad music but it just doesnt work. So i was just wondering of anyone could give me some advice. 

Thanks in advance"
SuckingGodsFinger,2021-10-04 18:26:35+00:00,Here for All,"I've battled depression my whole life and never had an outlet thinking my life was my fault and that the price of happiness wasn't worth the cost. In doing so I lived a life of destruction seeing that it was the only thing that made sense until I had my first born. I am still depressed, don't get me wrong, but it helped me realize that my life isn't just mine anymore and I'm thankful for that, granted the price of happiness is still fairly high. I just want you guys to know that I am here for every one of you, because that's what I wish I had before I became the person that I am. I want you to know that there is always someone there for you to vent to, or loved at that. Everyone deserves love. No matter the cost. I am here to give that to you if you need it."

user417417,2021-10-04 17:23:46+00:00,Depressed partner (24M) broke up with me,"My partner just ended our four year relationship about three weeks ago after a serious decline in his mental health over the last few months. 

After a date where he had two very bad public panic attacks, he broke up with me two days later. He cited “it’s not you, it’s me”, and said he needs time to focus on himself. He asked for space. 

Apart from being absolutely devastated, as this is my first major heartbreak, I am so incredibly worried about him. I am respecting his desire for space and am not contacting him at all.

He has distanced himself from all our our mutual friends. He has been unusually active on his social media since the breakup, and posting lots of pictures of him at work and hanging out with his work buddies. I took this to mean he was okay, but I ran into him on the street a few days ago (he approached me), and he stated that he hated his job, seemingly at odds to what he was posting. He didn’t ask me anything about myself at all, and just talked to me about his life. I told him I was worried about him, which he brushed off.

I am at such a loss as to what to do. I’ve been reading countless articles on what to do, half of them seem to suggest that I should just “give him space”, but the other half insist that I should keep reaching out, as he could be pushing people away just to isolate himself. I would reach out to his parents, but he doesn’t have a good relationship with them and I don’t want  to overstep his boundaries. What should I do? Help!"

I used to be so happy and sociable but now I don’t go anywhere. 
I think so much about suicide, and so deeply that I’ve got a master plan. 

However I’ve always wanted to try dmt, and I’m so determined I atleast try it before I pop my clogs. The thought of never trying it because I’ve killer myself.

My family and friends love me dearly but I’ve got to the point where I’m really not arsed anymore. I used to care about the reaction people would have to my death. But now it’s just so numb and dull.

Everyday I smoke weed and that’s the only happiness I string onto in my life right now. 

I’m appreciative that I got to live in this life, but I’m not going to suffer forever. My time is nearly here and I’m so thankful that I got to meet the people I’ve met. 

Much love. I try dmt Thursday, then I’m out."

Heisenburrito,2021-10-04 08:53:14+00:00,I was doing so well,"For 4 to 5 months I was working out, slowly regaining my ability to enjoy things again. I was losing weight and started to slowly do things creatively (writing and a youtube project).

Last month I got sick twice in a row. First there was a stomach virus that completely wrecked me followed by a flu like disease that may have been Covid. Since then I’ve been struggling to not feel like drowning in mental sludge. I try to pick up my routine of working out and watching what I eat but I don’t feel the push I normally feel to let me do the things I need to do. Like something is actively making me more tired the more I try to break free from numbness. Like quicksand. 

My main coping mechanism is eating and since nothing interests me again I think about eating nonstop. Eventually I indulge and feel worse for doing so. I don’t want to lose the progress I’ve made but it constantly feels like I have no control over my cravings. 

I know I just have to keep trying but it feels like every try gets slightly harder and I’m afraid of where my mental state is headed. It feels like I’m a bystander watching a train wreck that’s about to happen. The tracks are broken but there’s no way to stop the train before it gets there. 

I have a gf and two kids who need me. They can survive on their own but they love me and don’t want to see me this way. All the energy I have left to keep trying is because of them and I’m trying to hold on and get back on track but so far Ive failed for the past three weeks. It’s becoming hard for me to make it unnoticeable to outsiders. Thoughts of ending it are coming back. I have nothing good to say about myself. I feel like a failure. I’m running out of tries

I feel dumb. I can’t express myself the way I want to and I don’t think I ever can or ever will be smart enough to learn how. My self-awareness hurts me. I overthink everything while at the same time thinking there’s not much going on up there. It feels like I’m thinking nonstop but when I try to think of what I’m thinking about it feels like I wasn’t really thinking anything. As if my thinking is an illusion. 

I feel so lost and I’m too hard on myself. I don’t know what else to say. There’s a lot but I don’t feel like typing anymore. Or thinking. Or being conscious. I want to sleep."

I love her like I’ve loved nobody else and I want to give her the world shes really helped me mentally and spiritually, but as soon as one thing goes wrong I instantly get thrown back into my depressed helpless state that lasts until I kick myself out of it. It’s usually things that are either out of my control or things that are not that serious but I overthink it ALOT. I use to be avoidant. I’d ghost and ignore people when I felt I did something wrong, even if it wasn’t serious. I often find myself thinking about leaving even if Deep down I don’t want to. I don’t let her know about it nor do I EVER let it interfere with anything, but it could last as little as an hour or until I convince myself im fine. I’m just tired of so easily slipping back into my old ways and I’m afraid it won’t ever go away… is there anyway to stop"

Leaving the bar

A few brothers of mine happened to be there, a ruckus had occurred about a hour earlier. Needless to say they were still a little hype since the opposing party hadn't left.

While deciding who wanted to be out and who wanted to go back to the barracks....

Gun Shots ring out

Brother B is hit 3 meters in front of me. I see it but didn't believe what I saw to be true. Random Guy takes a round to the head 20 meters away.

LIKE AN ASSHOLE! I step over Brother B's body exclaiming ""B stop playing and get in the truck."" and move to assist the other victim. (I didn't know it was a headshot yet).

Conversation with Random Guy as follows:

Me: Hey bro I don't know head shots man but help is on the way.

Him: Auto breathing. (It's a lot like snoring, the eyes are open and starring off to the void)

Some Lady: Brother B's hit!!!

Me: O shit, hey dude helps coming....... (LIKE AN ASSHOLE! I WALK AWAY) \*He died a few days later\*

Me: \*Calling 911\* (This is a blur, I only remember saying ""Y'all taking too long, Aye put him in my truck."")

\*Flying down Dyer St toward Fred Wilson Ave E-lights blinking\*

Cherries and Berries pulls me over. We pull Brother B out of the truck...... There were attempts but, he was DOA...........

There is plenty more to this account. I've told most about this but no one speaks to me...... I just have another memory in my head on the never ending merry go round things that keep me up....... Wish I put Brother B in the fuckin truck......

I’ve lost my mom and so my mental state declined and wasn’t able to get into the college I wanted. Some other events happen I’m having to live back home with my dad but who is barely here. So it’s just me and my dog who is very old and also doesn’t have much longer. I’ve been trying to have a relationship for 3.5 years now and that’s not working. Today I even went out in hopes of going out on a date only to arrive and be stood up. I felt so dumb waiting almost 1 hour for him to show with no reply. I just wonder when my life is finally going to turn around like I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m always on the this Reddit and I just wish I could be someone else. I’m tired of being me.
naturessilence,2021-10-04 01:04:30+00:00,Creativity helps,"I’m 40 now and have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember. The number one thing that helps me is doing something creative. It feels like a cheat code where the moment can be so compelling that your worry is put aside. I have a band called Grey Fields (we make moody music similar to Radiohead) and even though I’m not making much money it’s something that feels true and meaningful to me. My point is if you’ve thought about playing an instrument, painting, writing, etc then do it. It’s not talked about enough but the creative process can be incredibly healing."

I barely get by and am in debt that I dont see myself getting out of anytime soon. I had a very traumatic childhood which I am still coming to terms with at 29 years old. I think more deeply than the average person which makes me more of an outcast. I am always underestimated. I am the maid of honor for someone who I have not been close with in 10 years.

stupidslutcocksucker,2021-10-03 18:00:07+00:00,I lost my first bestfriend★,"Hi guys! After my first ex, i lost my first bestfriend!

Everything started back in May. I had a friend of 9 years now. They were the only person I told everything about. Secrets, deep thoughts, etc. I trusted them. Now 2021 May came and they like started to text/talk to me less and became cold. It was like they were growing away from me.
I was confused like why? I did a lot of shitty things but damn, we were actually like bestfriends! But the most painful part was the realisation. 
They got closer to 2 of our classmates and literally left me for them. I have a past w one of them, she was the one who made rumors about me being a fag and etc. I got nothing to be mad about but still.

And finally, today was the day I unfollowed my bestfriend on every social media. This might sound like nothing but i just couldn't stand it anymore. They posted stories of their chats and that they are having fun, the same kind of fun they had with me. It hurts, its almost like our texts didnt mean anything anymore. And well, seems like it didnt. But i guess im just jealous and hurt. I havents talked to them anywhere for months now, only in school, i mean, they are my classmate afterall. But i cant blame anyone else but me for them leaving. As a fucked up, strong headed person i am. But if they didnt care back then, why now? I know the answer is obvious but it just hurts. Jealousy and sadness is what i can get out of my feelings. 

I haven't really told anyone about this, i had to get this off my chest. But really, i just dont have anyone to whine about this.

HeCantHaveKidsduhh,2021-10-03 15:12:45+00:00,What stops you ?,"Ive thought all weekend about ending it, I’ve been trying to think of reasons I shouldn’t end it. I’m really struggling to find any. 

So far the only reason I’ve managed to find is that I don’t want anyone to blame themselves for me doing it. Yknow? 

I don’t have any friends and that’s not an exaggeration. My phone has 6 contacts in it. 5 professional and 1 is my ex. 

I really want to end it but I don’t want me ex blaming herself, even if I feel like she’s not helped me in the same way I helped her. 

I try opening up to her and she just palms me off, saying only I can do it and it’s up to me. And all the cliche stuff people say. 
Truth is , I don’t feel like she cares, I feel like she just likes *saying* she does. It feels like it’s all lip service. 

I’m not blaming her, she’s dealing with her own stuff. I’m just saying , it’s hard to hear someone palm you off like that when you’ve literally gone into thousands of pounds worth of debt to try and help them 5 years earlier. 


I guess I can’t be saved. And even in my darkest hour I’m trying to think of other peoples feelings. 
Well maybe this time it’s time to start thinking about my own feelings. 

And I think there’s no saving me. I think I’d rather be dead than spend another week / month/ year alone. 

4 walls are not enough for me. I was happier in prison where at least I got some human interaction. 

Anyone else have odd reasons why they put off suicide ?"

In the beginning it was just pretty numb, not caring wether I was alive or dead. Last fall it got so bad that I was afraid of being to close to train-tracks and wrote a goodbye letter, but never actually persuaded anything. Since then I haven’t felt pure happiness.
I have a loving best friend, a boyfriend and a great friend group. A great family, but which I’ve felt somewhat disconnected from my family the past tree moths or so. 
I don’t want to leave them all behind, and I don’t want them to get sad for me leaving. 
But I’m just so tired, my body hurts, I have no energy, I just feel stupid and not good enough all the time. Things I used to love no longer brings me happiness.

All I want is just to be here with them, but being someone else. I don’t want to be me. I hate the way I look and talk and think and everything such as. The thing is a just want to get rid of me, I don’t want to live anymore and I hate myself. But I’m not ready to leave to ones I love yet."
Imaginary-Volume-402,2021-10-03 14:31:08+00:00,Getting blanked on WhatsApp,"I’m sure most people have felt the sting of getting ghosted/blanked online but has anyone had that experience happen with multiple friend groups all in short spaces of time? Tbh I’m not really bothered if it was someone I barely knew who did this but for friends who you’ve shared a history with, it really does sting.

I’m currently in uni and I’ve tried to reach out to my secondary school friends in the past couple years when I’m at uni. Most of them responded and we managed to hold a nice conversation but for 2 of them who I’ve always thought of as quite close friends since we knew each other since primary school, they just blanked me on WhatsApp mid convo after I’ve wrote a simple message like “so how’s your Japanese course going?” or “oh I thought you were taking a gap year?”. After that, every special event like summer or Christmas holidays is randomly message them and ask how their holidays are, but ofc, they continue to blank me. It really hurts more when you know that they’ve blanked you even after you showed your vulnerable side by continue to pursue them in the hopes to stay on friendly terms. And I know they blanked me because every time they have been online regularly and recently and my messages have all been delivered.

I can understand if people aren’t interested, but you can always keep things short, I don’t think it takes much effort to give a short sentence or phrase even as a simple reply. And that simple act, can make the major difference between making someone feel depressed to the point they dwell on the thought for a day and then every now and then pop up in the back of the mind, and not feeling that way. What do you guys think?

To add on to this I recently found that my friends group in uni have been going to events and doing stuff together regularly and they never invited me :( Again like I said, I wouldn’t be bothered if they were people who I barely talked to but these were people who I hung out with quite a bit back in first year of uni.. we had a history together and to find out that you’re basically invisible to them really hurts. I understand that there’s nothing wrong with people hanging with who they want to, but it’s still just quite saddening tbh. I know I don’t have anything against them because they’ve done nothing wrong but I just can’t help but feel a little bit angry when I’m reminded of them, but more so just feeling sorry for myself. 😔"

PoppyseedCupcake,2021-10-03 10:19:42+00:00,I just don't feel it anymore., I just want to be happy but I'm too afraid to be happy. I have a relatively new boyfriend that I've been for for 2 months now and he cares alot about me and treats me amazingly probably the best boyfriend I could ever ask for but I feel like my depression keeps coming back. Everytime I feel happy or feel like I'm happy a huge wave of depression and just self hate rushes over. I start to blame myself for everything that is wrong. Maybe its my upbringing or maybe it's the exs who made me feel like everything is my fault but idk. Some days I think about how life would be so much better with me not in it. I think about people and how much better they would be without me in their lives.  I don't know. It just seems so much simpler to just die and cease to exist than to keep going and acting as if people want me in their lives.

I can go as far as to say when these things happen they stay’s in our minds like trash being collected inside of us while trying hard to recycle an sort through those thoughts which improves our moods!.. until your neighbor’s or family’s dumb more in your pile to the point it gets so cluttered that it’s impossible to clear.. sometimes it builds up to much where we feel like we’re being suffocated in it!

SafeRoutine7,2021-10-03 08:37:17+00:00,Hurt emotionally,"TL DR:

Was attacked by verbal barbs and I am suffering emotionally, depressed. Need perspectives/advice.

I have been separated from husband due to his cheating and his family's abuse. Though his family members didn't directly abuse me, except his youngest brother's wife who is a sadistic sociopath, it's really evident that the family as a whole isn't good enough. This was an arranged marriage for me (late). My husband has been trying to talk after asking me sorry for what he did and wants to start afresh, and I was talking with him (not shouting like before) and made it clear to Stop calling me. I have low self-esteem issues too and right now and I am not in a good state. I'm living with my aunt right now, so She got irritated with my talking with my husband and afterwards threatened to break my phone. I was shocked and hurt by this. I have paid for the smartphone, my first smartphone brought just before my marriage (it took years for me to buy) and was triggered by this because even my husband used to threaten same (he wanted me to use the old model non-touch screen phone). She didn't Stop at this. She started attacking me emotionally and saying that ""see how you came back from your husband's house and your arrogance is the cause of this and you deserved more from your husband"" 

This hurt me [ rewinding a bit: Before my marriage, once after an argument, I had  messaged her that ""after marriage, she and her brother can think I have gone away from their lives (while doing kanyadaan to think that they are cutting all relationship ties) for good and live worry-free."" ] This was not good from my side and I regretted after, but My aunt showed the message to her brother, who I respect a lot, who felt hurt by my message though I didn't accuse him. If I knew that she was going to do this, I would not have messaged. I agree that I have also hurt them, and I am not perfect but it was written in hurt not arrogance.


I am bit straightforward and honest where others can't take it and accuse me of being judgmental (good intentions and not to hurt) so I try to be as sensitive and diplomatic. I told her that she never cared for me like on the day of assault where I was not able to even move my hands with bruises all over body, she didn't even lift a finger to help me (I honestly didn't expect though I would have been happy). At least she could have told me the truth that no one is going to come back to pack up (she lied to me that she is going to come help me over at the weekend with packers and movers). Afterwards, rudely she told me it's not her problem and to go alone (without her help) and bring my stuff. This hurt me because I would have done something by my own (packed essential things) on that day. By then my husband had distributed things to his shitty affair partners and others, who were too happy to get things for free. He burnt all my books which were my treasure, and I was HURT because I am too sentimental about my things. I know that someone else ( neighbour or a servant) would be helped by my aunt even if they had not been assaulted and could do things on their own.


She also started saying that I have been cruel to his youngest brother's wife who is a villager, egoistic dominating narcissistic (has made her submissive husband obey her), but still wanted my husband to torture me MORE and made many attempts too. He to appease her had even hit me in the in-law's house (village) for nothing. She's a dirty woman who wouldn't even rinse her kids shitted shorts kept near the washing stone. it was nauseating to see that. She was angry with me for it... and now my aunt is accusing me that ""are not they living beings and working there? Are you special?"" meaning I had to do all the work. I couldn't believe my own ears because I have not shown any arrogance but in fact I have been on the receiving end of illiterate villagers. This HURT me badly. my aunt herself hasn't done much in her in-law's house because she has good family and they are very clean (I love her in-law's family and place). I have done what I could sweep, mop, and cook food too, wash my plate and clothes,,but still He abused me for this as he wanted me to do everything alone (the facilities weren't good) making his brother's wife relax. 


The third HURT was when she compared me with my cousin sister in village who is younger than me, has kids, and saying that I am lowest than her and everyone in the world. I'm suffering because I am not a good girl who had an insensitive nature good heart etc.. I was so hurt that I have been crying from 3 days and got energy to post now. My heart and body has been badly affected by this. I had sort of panic attacks and had to go to a doctor. She cursed me that I am going to suffer in life more because of my bad nature. TBH, I have been on the receiving end of other's arrogant condescending attitude.

My cousins who are village people rub it on my face and hurt me. They have an arrogant attitude towards me that I don't know what to do. I can't act like them even if I wanted to... Once my relatives even interviewed me by asking me about recipes about cooking to know for sure whether I can cook. This was so humiliating for me, but when I answered confidently they were reluctant to accept that I passed the interview and pointed out that I am slow. Maybe because of my mouth-breathing problems, I look DUMB, but I am not dumb for sure. 

I don't know what they want to achieve by doing everything that hurts me, and it seems that they are getting pleasure from their condescending disrespectful attitude. This is not limited only to cooking, but in OTHER THINGS in life as well like studying, etc...such that I believed in that and grew up like that. I am now scared of living, of my future. If I stand up for myself, I am attacked more badly and my backlash is not good for them... like I am labelled as a villain and ostracized and told that "" I am a person who can't get along with anyone. I'm a bad person with a bad heart and so only I am suffering from life. I'm so worthless and low than them that I should not even think of comparison with them"" in their arrogance which hurts. Can't help, but think that blood related family members could damage one so badly. Them taking enjoyment from my suffering is cruelest thing in the world. My mental and emotional health has taken a beating now from such toxicity and my personal issues. I don't know what to do, I am not understanding.

I am not understanding whether my honesty, sensitive, and innocent good nature is the cause of all this. Because I am not materialistic, not too bold, and a simple-minded girl who loves humanity and forgives easily, am I so worthless?? Am I supposed to suffer so much because I am not aggressive and competitive in nature or an extrovert who shows off by talking? Am I Suffering so much because I am a motherless child??

Am I in the right or wrong? Am I an angel or fool who has tolerated so much harshness and forgiven them to only have them continuing? How do I even deal with such?

In the past I was bullied so much I wore padding to soften the kicks and the punches. I thought this was the same case as ""the new kid"". But I was pleased to find out its not that bad, the people were nice and everything seemed alright. But then I met a man, his name was Sky and he was everything I wanted. As a man myself I was certain I was gay because if the way he made me felt. I wanted to spend the rest of my days. I wanted to die next to him. I asked him out on April 2nd 2021. And he said yes and I was happy. We dated for 6 months. And I slowly noticed that he was changing, like his vibe was off every time I saw him. Then last week I was woken up to the sound of my phone ringing. It was a call from Sky's mother. She sounded very scared and upset so I asked what was wrong. She simply responded with "" he is gone"" then the phone hung up. I ran to his house as fast as I could with tears flowing like rivers down my face. I get to his house and there was an ambulance there, with someone inside. I demand I see whoever is in there. And they let me inside and I uncovered this blanket that was covering a body. It was Sky, he was dead. I then look at the rest of his body and I found he had a stab wound to the stomach as well as cuts all up and down his arms. I screamed as loud as I could. I had went to the hospital afterwards for treatment of shattered vocal cords. After his death, all my friends left me behind I was truly alone. And I still remain silent and alone. I feel at fault for his death and I wish I would have joined him. I want to see him again . I miss him ."

stphvn,2021-10-02 03:56:09+00:00,Going through everything again,"Hi. I just wanted to vent since I've been feeling quite alone lately. Idk if any of this is wrote correctly since english is not my first language.



I've been dealing with depression my whole life, I dropped out of high school due to it, and everything that it carries (my attempts, being on psych, truancy, lack of motivation, bullying, meds not working, other disorders being diagnosed, etc).



Eventually everything got better. I ended High School, I got into Uni, I've got a job, I got some friends, even had some lovers and all. Due to being an introvert and a quite asocial person (plus being hospitalized most of my youth) I never really knew what kind of things I liked or wanted to do for the rest of my life so I tried a couple of careers before deciding what I wanted to pursue in life, some months ago I felt like I took control over everything.



But I'm feeling miserable again. Even if I took control of my life I feel like is too late, I'm almost at my mid-20s and seeing every friend finishing their careers and me just starting it makes me feel like shit, even they laugh at me because of that and my dad doesn't lose an opportunity to tell me how disappointed he is, comparing me with some cousins that ended their careers when they ‘had’ to. I'm thinking about how much time I wasted being sick and (once again) I feel like shit. There's so many things in my head that I don't feel like talking about. It's been weeks since I anticipated waking up, since I was excited for the next day. It's been months since the last time I looked myself in the mirror and felt ‘proud’ of being alive and for surviving everything that I went trough. I just feel like it's pointless.



What's the point of living if I don't want to? If I hate what I see on the mirror? If I hate waking up having all these memories stuck in my head? If my existence doesn't make anyone happy? If I'm not happy? It got to the point where I can't even concentrate on classes again because I can't stop thinking about how depressed I feel.



I know it's not too late, I know that I'm young (I guess…), I know that the years that I ‘wasted’ I was healing, I know that I didn't got sick because I wanted to (who wants to be depressed? Ffs). But I can't help it. I tried to talk with my ‘friend’ about everything but she told me I was too old for this. I don't want to seek for help, I don't want to be on meds again. I just don't know what to do."
bestfunny2,2021-10-02 03:55:16+00:00,"Struggling to move on, with few friends, stress at home, over a guy from last year","I will be in 2 weeks 27. I feel like I am 24 and slept the past 2 years away literally.

This guy was someone who was flirting with me from 2015-2017. He ghosted me twice in that time period and the last episode was because he graduated. I had him on FB until he delated his FB account earlier this year.

I never have been with a guy and until Jan of 2021 just got on BC pills. I have irregular cycles, and until Jan-Feb won't know if they are equal. I had to switch medication in April 2021 because of a short cycle.

Basically my story goes like this, I walked in on mom and dad taking about guy and I in 2020. He appeared to be single. Now he's seeing someone. Until he delated his FB account, he was making meme jokes that could have been pointed references to me. My family won't confirm to save face (all mom said to me was we thought he was seeing someone or it was off) but we have a couple friends of friends of the family. These people could have gotten the comments he was making and telling him.

The number I had for him, I am now blocked and he won't add me on insta. So if I run into him its a total start over despite the conversation from 2020.

My family is going through a bad time as well (another situation). Again he could easily hear the highlights.

I cannot fathom how within 6-8 weeks I had the high of he asking about me, to the low he might be seeing someone. 

All my friends from college years have moved on, want nothing serious or message me when they want to. All of them are out of state and in serious relationships.

But its very clear to me that to some of these girls, I was a joke over this guy. 

So I am now starting over and am forced to accept. Accept I have zero friends, family won't speak about it as it goes through a business deal, and am forced to move on with my life.

boringcrabby,2021-10-02 02:43:22+00:00,My mother is wrong?,"My mom wonders why I hate my body and she tells me all the time “when I hate my life, I think about how there are people out there who have it way worse, and I think how lucky I am to not be one of those people.” It bothers me that she says this. So I hate my body but what she doesn’t know is I hate myself completely. Not just my looks. When she says that sentence I just think about the fact that I have thought that same thing tons of times. And you know what? It makes me feel worse about myself. That’s because I already hate myself, my body, personality, laugh, and everything else about me, so when I think “why in the hell am I complaining about my life” it makes me hate myself even more. Because I’m being selfish and it’s irrelevant that I hate myself. I need to care more about other people but I don’t. None of this probably made sense, I just needed to tell someone this."
ominousdominus,2021-10-02 01:38:36+00:00,I don't know what to do anymore,I don't know where to start but I just felt like reaching out and talking about my life. I've been married now close to 9 years and my marriage is coming undone (again). My wife and I had a conversation earlier in the night and she came on heavy talking about how she feels like she's in a loop day in and day out. I feel the same also only because I wake up every morning at 5 and work and come home close to 5. We have two kids (2 &amp; 5) and we really don't get to spend much time together. I get home and I am immediately trying to get the kids off of her hands so she can do her schoolwork and that goes late into the night and by the time she finishes I am always fast asleep. We have our daily routine with the kids and everything and the monotony is hard. We have no family nearby and very few friends because there's social anxiety issues we deal with. My wife is skeptical about trusting anyone with the kids which I understand but it's been a long time since we've had any alone time just to spend the quality time together. She told me during our conversation that she feels our time together has come to an end and does not want to continue to put in the effort anymore considering the first years of our marriage I wasn't that great of a husband and took it for granted. Come 2020 we were going to get a separation but we ended up working stuff out and I started talking to a therapist and taking meds for my anxiety/depression. She said that I've got stuff that I've got to work through and she doesn't want to wait for me to work through it anymore also. I'm heartbroken because I am trying my best at everything. I don't get alot of sleep and with this I am a grump. She doesnt think I can be happy with our family. I dont want our marriage to end because we have two wonderful children and we do so well with each other(or so I thought). I can't take it sometimes when we have these heavy conversations because my mind goes to dark places and I think of hurting myself to hurt her but given I had a sister who committed suicide I couldn't do it to my family. It's hard though because those thoughts are never a healthy thing for me and make it hard to get over the things she says sometimes. Most of the times my feelings get hurt like that I get mad and almost feel like I need to hate her for it but I always tellyself what's the point. I go back and forth to try and make something of it but I just get inside my head and spiral. I wish I wasn't this way because it hurts those around me and I feel like it would be better for me to be completely out of the picture. I think this purely out of anger inside me and seeking something to make me feel better but I catch myself going to my dark thoughts. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I was doing good at trying to be a better husband and father but at this point what do I have. I don't know what will make me happy anymore.

A wanted us to find another house to live in and i thought we could invite our friend K to live with us too. 
But A has started crushing on Ns boyfriends housemate. 
Me and A talked tonight and both her and N want to live with the boys. A said i can join them if they want, but it was clearly a ""you can come if you want"" kinda thing. 
I said if they do end up doing that, ill just find a place by myself. After i said that, A looked happy and went off to bed. 

I feel like im being abandoned, i dont really have any other friends, K has a massive group of friends but ill try with her. But im really sad my friends are choosing guys theyve known for a few days-3 months."

I know a lot of people use humor to cope. I have pretty dark humor and enjoy depressing humor on more private forums like this. But when one my classmates jokes about how mentally unstable they are («i wanna die lmao»)or something like that, it just gets on my nerves. 

First of all, it’s just really bland unoriginal humor. But it also makes me bitter. Like they’re stealing something away from me. 

I think i have a tendency to judge other people who talk abt their terrible mental health, but are very extroverted and energetic at school. I know it’s wrong of me and i dont truly believe that. I know im not very obviously depressed either, few are, but i cant imagine ever acting like they do while being depressed."

Like i imagine how it would look if i was beating up myself. Or watching myself get hit by a car or train. Crushing a mini version of myself between my fingers. Crushibg my skull like an egg. I dont fantasize abt suicide as much as fantasize about torturing myself.

I pretend to be productive but my lack of motivation has gotten so bad that I just self-sabotage. Every time I’ve worked hard for something in life, whether it be academics or career, it always fell into pieces out of my control. 

I now know that hard work really means nothing and I’ve given up on overextending myself or trying to meet deadlines. I’m not sure if this is depression but I just have the aching feeling like nothing is worth it. I don’t want to work hard for things if they won’t help improve my life. 

- I was a straight A/B student in elementary school and was bullied out of school. 

- I tried to have friendships and relationships but they were ruined because my strict parents wouldn’t let me go anywhere. Now I lack social skills as an adult.

- I worked hard to go to nursing school but right as I was about to apply, coronavirus appeared and the program was canceled. 

I’m just lost and confused and have no more motivation to try to live a somewhat normal life."

I work in the SPED department at an elementary school and one of the 5th grade girls I work with has been seen scraping her forearm with a pencil as if she is trying to cut her skin. A lot of her self worth seems to be in what a boy thinks of her; if he doesn’t give her attention or good response to her one day, it ruins her whole day. Her mother doesn’t care and dismissed the pencil thing as “art.” 

So I have a history of bad self harm and addiction to it and am just starting the process myself of recovery by going to a psychiatrist and a support group. So this is really hard for me to see in a girl so young. 

Do you guys have any advice for me on how to approach the topic with this girl? What do you wish teachers would have done in response? Or what could I do to support her and keep her from going down the same path that I am?

Any advice helps please"

I have had headaches, nosebleeds, physical pains, and a fever

Its hurting my relationships, I feel like i can't talk to anyone, and that if I were to they wouldnt undertsand my perspective. Im hoping that writing out what happened and how i feel about it might point me ina forward direction, and maybe itll help me stop being so irritated, idk. I just want to stop being so mean to my fiancee, they dont deserve it.

Right now im living in my mother in laws RV, on her property, rent and utilities free. We moved here a few days ago, and its been really hard for me to adjust. My fiancee and their mom have had a rough relationship growing up, and its been really hard for me to feel ok around her. Shes an recovering addict and my fiancee would tell me how they felt about her, so much so that i started really disliking her. I get really protective of my fiancee and had decoded already to not trust her or her motovation, but now I live there and I have this huge wall around her and honestly I dont think shes so bad. Shes a therapist now and she and I love talling about Psychology, she thinks a lot like me and I feel like an asshole now. She talks to me about how the things in her past corralate with things shes learn about now, and after we talk about it I want to share the facinating things I learned but i get that those exact memories are a part of my fiance's hurt. I know now not to talk about those memories to them, but I already did the damage. My fiancee and i would talk about everything prior to moving into their moms, but now I have to constantly think about what I say. 

I know its what comes with moving in with people, but its been really hard for me to adjust to living with peoples rules again. Im constantly reminded to eat food, what food to eat, what fun things to go do, that shower is always available by my fiance's mom. I know shes doing all this stuff to comfort us and help us get on our feet since weve been through so much, but all I feel is irritated.

Within this past week i have had to get two jobs, vaccinated, update everything on my car, pay for groceries and dog supplies, and leave my family, and i still have to just keep living and moving on. Now i just am suppose to make money and keep living until the next thing happens, but I dont feel like I even care for the next thing.

Before this week, I had lived about 30 minutes from my whole family, I worked and lived on a horse ranch in an rv with my fiancee and our two dogs. Our dogs could go run around whenever they wanted, i could walk out my dog and there were horses and dirt everywhere. It smelled like leather and sand and pine shavings. There was people who would show up and we all just loved the horses. I drove heavy machinery, i was learning everyday, and i got to work a few of horses that would be my project. I dont currently own my own horse, but its been my dream since I was little to have one and to have my own farm and do crazy stunts like vaulting and trick riding. I was learning the basics for riding and had access to a horse whenever i wanted. I love the process of getting them ready for riding, and my favorite is when i sit on a horse for the first time that day and I feel my hips loosen as we walk together. My horse there was Grace, she was a beautiful morgan horse. She loved food and would try to trick me into thinking training was over so she could go eat. She gave really good hugs. Were not there anymore, and my heart feels broken. My whole childhood i fought tooth and nail to be on ranches. 

My first ranch i worked on was back im 8th grade, at my exs moms arabian ranch. At the time i volunteered there, i was given a horse named Ginger who was my project horse. I worked with her on ground manners, grooming, and socializing and desensitization. I loved her so much, and i lost her when my exs mom moved him to another school, effectively breaking us up and taking away my first horse.

I was 20 when i started working ranches full time, im 22 now. Ive been between a few different ranches trying to find the right now, but landed at a training stable in acton, the one i was talking about above that had Grace. My fiancee and i both work on the ranch with another employee, named J. J is a 53 year old latino man, ex convict, previous addict, and had worked previous at this ranch but was fired for using meth on the property. He was rehired when covid hit because the owners were having a hard time finding workers. We were hired a few days after him, and all three of us lived on the property in our rvs. 

During the course of us working there, J would get really aggited ith my fiancee and would start yelling or arguing with them. My fiancee talked on many occasions with the bosses regarding his behavior, and we were sked to understand they jeed him for their business and if we could be patient while they found a replacement. He got into an argument with one of the bosses, and she fired him on the spot and gave him a few days to move out. My fiancee and I were so excited, other independent contractors who came to the ranch were happy, client were happy. J blamed him being fired on us. He spent a day pacing the property until my fiancee and I we alone. He ran up on with a pipe and tried assulting my fiancee and kept saying to fight J. We didnt, backed away from him and went to tell our boss.

They sat and talked with him about what happened, and they fucking REHIRED HIM!! Our bosses sat us down and explained they would do everything they could to seperate us, spliting shift and hours. Only let him work around us supervised, and they were planning to work the living fucking out him so he would learn a lesson. My fincee and i were stunned and fucking pissed, but we stuck around for a few more days. We let them lnow that we would leave if he pulled even one more small incident. Were werent set up at the time to leave, and even if we could we wouldnt. Too many of my family events were coming up, like my oldest sisters wedding which was on 10.31.

At the same time as all of this is happening, one of my childhood mom (not blood related but shes been another mom for me along with my blood mom. Theyre best friends and have been my whole childhood) was fight panceriatic cancer. We had just gotten then news she was getting worse, and that she had less than a week to live. So the week where J was being worked to the bone, my fiancee and i wrre gone to the hospital and my moms house so we could be with her as much as possible. She died September 11th, and it looked so incredibly painful. She used to be plus size, she had the biggest smile and the sweetest voice, and i was her favorite of my moms daughters. All her email and wifi passwords were my name. I never understood why i was her favorite. I hope i live up to it every day now.

After she passed, J was too injured to keep working so he took a few days off. My fiancee and i started working at the ranch again, and it was nice to not be around J. It was quite, it smelled good, the horses were nice, and i just got space to grieve. We talked with my bosses here and there to check in with them and see if they decided to keep him or of they found new people. They danced around the subject but said they were doing what was best for their ranch. They said over and over how they feared we wpuld physically burn out and no one wpuld be able to work the ranch, so they need J in case we do. We told them that we were already about to reach the point of emotional burn out and that our mental, physical, and emotional were veing extremely affect by J and his actions.

The day J started working again, he tried attacking my dog. So my dog Oliver has been trained a little for service dog work and has been my emotion support dog for the past 2 1/2 years. I didnt complete his training because i didnt feel i needed a service of him other than to break me from my dissosations, so i let him be a well trained dog. For some reason (probably cause he has amazing judgement) anytime Oliver would see J he would bark at him and put himself between me and J. I worked pn introducing the two of them together, having oliver come walk over to J and sniff him and say hi, but Oliver just didnt trust him.That day I had watched as J was loading hay to feed the horses from the inside of a barn, and Oliver from outside the barn was watching him. J started commenting and aggitating Oliver and being an angry old ass, so Oliver barked at him. J used the cart full of hay to lunge at my dog to try and hurt him, J didnt know i could see him. Istarted yelling at Oliver to get out of the way, and i chased oliver back to my RV so J cpuldnt touch him. J ran and hid in his RV and just shputed at my to leave. 

I went to talk to my boss about it, and she got mad saying she just wanted one day without conflict, then asked me to explain what happened. I got so mad and felt like she wasnt going to take me seriously and tht nothing was going to be done about J.

Since the inital incidents where J tried hitting us with a poll to that day where he trord to hurt Oliver, my fiancee and i hadnt felt like we could walk around the property without looking over our shoulders constantly. The anxiety and stress that it brought to my family was unbearable, but we had waiting it out to see if our bosses would wise up and fire him so we could keep working on our own. After she didn't gove me the space to talk, my fiancee called it and we were going to leave that night. I went to see my family after the incident, and let them know i was leaving and that i probably wouldnt see them again until my oldest sister wedding.

Its been really hard to process everything going on, and when i try to verbally process my depression with my fiancee it causes them anxiety. They feel guilt about leaving the ranch, and i feel as though when i want to tall about everything that happened that it will just hurt them more. Weve talked and theyve said their anxipus cause they cant help with my depression. I got really hurt because ive been saying how much i want a therapist, but i haven't gotten on it yet. They said if it was an important priorty that i would have worked more on it in the past 3 days, but now i just feel shame all the time. Id rather not even tell them how i feel if it just hurts them and  i am just suppose to go to a therapist anyway. Id rather suffer alome and silently and as terribly as possible than know my depression is giving my fiancee anxiety. They feel lile ill leave them and take everyting and go work on the horse ranch alone so i can be happy and in my dream again. I have been crying saying how hard its been since i cant be around horses anymore, how i feel lile i i don't have a purpose anymore, how scared i am to try again and to lose another horse, but they just feel guilty about how unhappy i am. I just want it to be ok for me to feel depressed about it and to be able to take some time to recover from everything going on, but i dont feel like i can. Ive been trying to figure out therapy, but i had to get so much shit together first. Weve lived here for less than a week now.

I have to work hard now and make money so i can get back to my family for my sisters wedding, there arent too many ranch hiring near me but i keep calling asking if the need a ranch hand, and i want to save up so i can do my circus classes agin, buy a motorcycle, and to buy my own horse so no one can ever take them away again. 

Idk when things will get better, but im trying to hold out and survive till then. Hopefully ill get a therapist soon, maybe some guidance towards my goals and dreams. Idk."

I won't pass the semester, not speaking about year or the highschool exam. I already wasted my life and it won't change because i can't change. I know I'll get beat up by my father today. I know I'll have a shouting contest with my mother today. I know none of these will change even in the slightest how I'll act. 

I've heard giving up is supposed to feel good, because why worry about anything, right? Well, I know that the only thing my giving up will amount to is getting my stomach smashed by my fathers fist because I am not up to standards. I just want to wither and die."

I've had over 9 jobs since I started working at the age of 15 and am currently working part-time at a warehouse. I regularly struggle with getting up in the morning and getting to work on time, which is why I've had over 9 jobs. I also have a habit of calling in sick when in reality I just really don't want to work. The problem is that I know I shouldn't be doing this and that I could very well lose my current job, but I can't seem to stop and that just makes me feel even worse. Here I am, complaining about having to work 20 hours a week when there's other people with depression who are able to work 40 hour weeks no problem. I have no reason to call in or leave early either. All I do is go home and lay in bed doing nothing. I hate work and I'm sure 99% of people do, but even though I know I need to work I call in anyways. Are my parents right about me being a lazy POS and a parasite? It's sure is starting to look that way. I just don't know what to do anymore. Why do I do this to myself and why can't I stop? For Christ's sake I'm at work right now and am currently thinking about saying I don't feel good so I can go home early. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME???"
BMHR4444,2021-09-30 14:53:16+00:00,4 months PP and traumas coming back up,"Why are you holding onto all the pain? You can let it go. You need to let it go. But it’s not that easy. I can’t just get rid of it. The memories come back every day. The voice doesn’t stop. I wanna shut up the voice. I wanna make it stop. Stop telling me I’m worthless. Stop telling me everyone would be better off. Stop telling me I deserve to feel hurt and pain so if you’re happy, we need to sabotage. I am NOT a burden. But I feel like everyone’s had enough of me. They’ve had to deal with how I behaved when my step dad was around. They had to deal with all the tears and drama from the assault. They always have to deal with my shit. But I can’t keep it in. If I keep it in, my chest just keeps getting heavier and heavier. It’s gets so hard to hold back the tears I just weep all the time because crying makes me chest feel a little less heavy. I don’t speak up and tell people how I really feel in hopes to spare their feelings. If they messed up, or I’m upset I’ll just keep it to myself so they don’t have to feel how I feel everyday. After being sad for so long you just kind of get used to it. Being happy is the best high ever. On a day where I forget about my sadness like on a game day out with friends. But then it gets quiet for a second and the sadness comes back and reminds me it’s still there so the happiness fades a little because who cares? We’re all gonna die anyway. I don’t think I was meant for this world. But every time I think about leaving I just can’t. Is this Hell? This is satans domain after all. I just wish I knew what I could do to make the sadness and the voice go away. If I can do that maybe I’ll have my life back. Maybe my hope back. My actual real true smile, not the one I put on so people stop asking me “what’s wrong” because the fact of the matter is that they don’t care. No one cares. And the people that do care? Well, they’re just as sad as me."

Spacetalks3114,2021-09-30 06:28:17+00:00,"Nihilism is the ultimate freedom, but in return, you lose everything that makes you happy. A piece of my origin story of how I ended up in this depressed position/suicidal mindset. Part 1:","I apologize for the jumbled format, I started this yesterday and I only spent like 45 minutes on this post. I didn't edit or anything because I just had a bunch of thoughts I wanted to throw out. And this isn't my entire story as I've had such a complex life, but this is a small portion of how I got into nihilism and how it affects me.

Hello all,

I am making this post because I struggle with depression, I post about it a lot. It helps sometimes, and sometimes venting makes me feel less alone. I both love and hate it when people can relate to my posts. I hate that they are just as sad as me, but feel comfort in the herd. Depression can make you feel alone, and while people have recently went through my history to berate me, I can assure you, there is nothing I want more than to be happy and leave Reddit. But, I have fallen into a very bad mindset/depression, of which has been cultivating for years but finally hit it's new low this year when I became an alcoholic (briefly) and started realizing how difficult my life is. (Beyond what I post about on Reddit, as it can be extremely personal and uncomfortable to talk about.)

Anyways, I'm making this post because I want to right some of my wrongs. And the only way I know how to do that is to be honest about myself (for the most part), about what I've learned, and to bring light to my experiences so that maybe someone else can empathize and better their own lives.

I have a .22 (gun) I bought a few weeks ago as I was going to commit suicide that night. I didn't post about it because I do like to keep some things personal and my problems are beyond just lookism (I mostly focus on the lookism aspect on Reddit), but I do have a lot of personal issues that really really suck. Many of which includes recent deaths of loved ones/friends (3 deaths in 5 months), the abandonment of my parent, a struggle with my ""sexuality"", and overall, plenty of other issues that go beyond what I want to talk about on Reddit. Or to anyone besides a mental health professional.

With all that being said, now let's talk about Nihilism, how my mindset became absolutely insane, and hopefully this can help someone else out:

Nihilism is the ultimate freedom, but in return, you lose everything that makes you happy.

The Merriam-Webster definition of Nihilism is: ""a viewpoint that traditional values and beliefs are unfounded and that existence is senseless and useless.""

And while nihilism is a more complicated topic than that, for the sake of this post, this definition will be sufficient.

I became a nihilist at around the age of 16 years old. It was a YouTube video that changed my entire mindset completely.

Now, I have always been a bit of a dark natured kid, (I had chalked it up to teenaged angst) but as a young teen, I didn't realize that my problems weren't entirely of my own making, they were more complex, with family abuse, etc. (More than I would like to discuss on Reddit.)

And when I was young, I searched for an answer to cure my depression. The answer I got was nihilism with a twist. The twist was, (if there's an actual term please post it below), that you can do anything, have ultimate freedom, and have no consequences, but in return: you live a suicidal lifestyle. The worst possible thing you can do is kill yourself, so all options are on the table. You can be as rude as you want or you can gamble all your money away, because you have an out. Nothing matters. And because of that, I made plenty of reckless (and quite selfish) choices. If nothing matters and I want to die, then you live your life on a sort of ""godmode."" And with that aspect of life, it's completely liberating. I'd imagine it's similar to finding out you have a terminal illness and doing everything you want to do before you die, the consequences do not seem to matter.

And when I was younger, I used this mindset as a great motivator. I used it to do better in school, achieved dreams that my teachers told me to give up on, and pushed myself farther than what anyone expected of me. Because in a strange contradictory way, the nihilistic aspect of life that there is no meaning, gave me meaning. The constant threat of my suicide pushed me into doing something because there was no meaning/pointless and I decided to create my own meaning. If I failed, suicide was always on the table.

However, this mindset also turned me into a monster in a way, because when nothing mattered, my choices became more selfish. Hurting the one person who loved me (my best friend). But back then, I didn't really care. Because I had a way out. Nothing mattered. Suicide would be the fate of my existence, therefore, I had solved the mystery of how I would die, and roughly when. And before I died, I wanted to do everything I could. Hell, I almost took a loan out of the bank that I knew I would never pay back, to go to a bunch of 5 star hotels, one of Bobby Flay/Gordon Ramsay's restaurants and have some fun. Because I didn't care about consequences. Can't force a dead girl to pay her debts. 

And I did end up spending some of my own money to go on a trip to a couple states before I ended it (visiting a few friends before I died), but ended up cutting the trip short as I wanted to give life one last shot. (This was a few years ago.)

For this mindset, I'm sure people say they live like this, but I don't think many truly do. If I had to guess, I'd say truly living like you're going to die everyday would be quite rare. In that case, I do see this mentality usually play out in two scenarios. 1. Betting all your money on a stock/other risky behavior. Or 2. Going on a shooting spree. Both often resulting in a suicide and disaster.

Now, you need to take risks in life. You should take risks, a truely good life has tons of risks involved, but the mindset of suicide being the way out is a borderline sociopathic. That consequences don't matter because they do. Maybe not to you (it does because deep down you want to be happy) but to the people who care about you. I don't have a lot of people who care about me. I just have one person who cares in my real life. She means the world to me. And hurting her with my nihilism/suicidal tendencies is shitty. And I'm so sorry to her.

This mindset was alluring to me for 4 ways: 1. As I titled this, it is indeed the ultimate freedom. Because you take risks, you live your life on ""godmode"" as you are truly free. 2. We want control over our fate, as many of the people who end up with this life style do not feel/never had control over their life. 3. It makes your problems feel better because there is a way out. (Basically a twisted coping mechanism). ""That person just cut me in line? I guess it doesn't matter because I could go home and blow out my brains and the pain would be gone."" 4. Alleviates existential boredom. In a weird way, it's quite exciting, as your choices can be unpredictable, your life much different than anticipated.

So yeah, as a conclusion to this jumbled 45 minute rant I whipped up on my laptop, is this mindset a good mindset? Will I ever leave this mindset? What is some advice I have for you?

I wish I could give the socially correct answer by stating, yes I will leave this mindset someday. This mindset for me started out with good intentions. Make risky choices that most would be afraid to engage in, because I had suicide as a plan B, and act on it if my life got way too fucked up. However, I don't think I'll ever entirely leave this mindset because there can be some benefits to having it. I do think I'll try to remove the bad aspects of it, rather than having a suicidal way out, I could maybe focus on not fearing death/making meaning out of the inherently meaningless, saving others because of my bleak outlook (by being truly honest and giving solid advice), etc.

About a few years ago, the original positive intentions (take extreme risks to hopefully benefit my life/make some meaning out of my meaningless life, if successful), turned into a twisted coping mechanism not to better my life but to make risky choices to just see what I could do because fuck all, nothing matters. Like the ultimate counter culture. Saying/doing things most people would fear to do because they fear the social repercussions of their choices, whereas a suicidal person does not.

If you want advice from someone who lives this, this is my honest answer for you. Don't be afraid to take risks, but don't live for suicide. Rather than have the mentality of ""I am going to take risks and have an out if my life gets too shitty by committing suicide."" Live your life in a less depressive way. ""I am going to take risks because they have the potential to make my life better, and even if they don't pan out, I will die someday anyway and the pain will be over. Besides, what else is there to do? I'm alive so I might as well live until my natural death because fuck it, there's nothing better to do."" That seems to be a healthier mindset, at least for someone like me.

Be aware that death can happen at any time, so don't be afraid to ask the girl out you like or apply for the internship you desperately want. The worst that can happen is that you die. You might be rejected, hell, it's life, you'll probably be rejected hundreds of times, but not trying and being a chicken is more soul crushing than being rejected. Trust me, I have regrets in life and it's not the things I did do (albeit I do have a fair share of cringey moments) it's the things I was too scared to do. That's what ruins a life the most. The never knowing and the never trying.

Hopefully this makes some sort of sense, usually it's gibberish and confusing, but yeah.

Edit: I'm not liking the format of this gibberish I might delete later tonight but for now it's bedtime. ;\*"

I don’t have a great support system and my
professors watch me like hawks waiting for me to mess up and fail their classes again. I can’t help but feel that I am the BIGGEST disappointment to my parents. I’m not graduating on time and I don’t know how to tell them - they would be so disappointed with me. I’m not suicidal anymore and I don’t drink to cope with my problems like I did last year. I’m proud of myself for making strides. But they feel like such small strides. I’m twenty-one and all my friends have their lives figured out. Meanwhile I just feel so behind. I just miss the person used to be. I wish I could go back in time and redo everything. Please offer advice. I just need to get my life back on track before I fall into the same sad pit I fell into last year. It just feels so pointless."

BradenAnderson,2021-09-29 22:28:43+00:00,Maybe I was born in the wrong country,"Even before covid hit, I had no friends or hope in hell of talking to girls. I don’t know if it’s just from my experience, but I’ve always gotten this attitude from girls that I have to earn the right to interact with them. Even just to say hi to them. Because, at this age, girls apparently believe that looks and conventional attractiveness are the most important thing. I hope that this is just a phase and after age 30 girls put more stock in personality and connection. Maybe Japan is on to something when they have cuddle cafes, renting girl/boyfriends, etc and other services for those of us who want to experience intimacy. Sure, you have to pay money to use these services. But is that really a bad thing? To allow lonely and alienated people a chance to experience what so many take for granted, I think it’s worth trying"

operationashpoint,2021-09-29 21:57:14+00:00,Son is lonely,"Askin for my son. My son is 21 and is still a damn virgin, and its fuckin tearing him apart. I can understand his pain and understand why he is constantly angry about his situation. I’m doin him this favor because he’s too embarrassed to talk on a forum. He is also introverted. Most of the days he complains to me (and it’s pretty damn obvious) how girls dont like him and how girls dont talk to him. That fact that he aint having sex is destroying him mentally and constantly pissing him off. People are generally scared of him because of they way he carries himself and his don’t give a fuck attitude. Sometimes when we talk he doesnt care about intimidating guys because he doesn’t want to talk to people, but he hates scaring away girls and tries his best not to scare them. There have been times he had girl friends but he pushed them away. It seems like no matter what he does he cant get chicks to like him, no matter how nice he tries to be. But its funny because he says despite girls not talking to him, once in a while a girl does seem to want to talk to him. So why does every other girl not like him/want to be around him while that occasional chick wants to talk to him? What are your thoughts on why girls dont like him/wouldn’t want to have sex with him? Also do you think my son will be like this forever. Feedback is appreciated."

She left me after she found out she was pregnant with my kid. She's trying to push me out of the picture completely. A couple months after she left, a good friend of mine that I have known for 16 years came in the picture. We got together quick, and all that history together caught up to us and we fell for each other HARD. Everything was going great. Literally the best relationship of my life. She is honestly the woman of my dreams. A few months go by, she realizes that she still loves her ex husband and is holding out hope that he will want her back. She leaves me because of it. We still talk every day. She still tells me she loves me and misses me. We still occasionally sleep together. But not actually being together is killing me. My depression has went off the charts. And on top of that, the mothers of my 2 kids that are already born have been giving me hell saying how I failed at being a father, how much of a piece of shit I am, how terrible of a person I am etc. I moved some friends in to keep them from being homeless, they took over my house and now I'm having to move out and start over again.

How much money and resources would be freed up if doctor assisted suicide was legal. I’ve been suffering with depression and suicide for almost 40 years now and everyone tells me “it will get better.” But it never does. It gets worse and worse. I’ve been wanting to die since the early 80’s and no amount of therapy or medication has helped. But  being forced to live out this meaningless existence.

Why?"

HeCantHaveKidsduhh,2021-09-29 10:51:00+00:00,Help me I’m sinking,"So my (36m) relationship recently broke up and I’m really struggling with feeling like I’m worth anything anymore. I’ve felt worthless all my life to be honest and when I first met my (29f) girlfriend she was in a bad place. We got on really well and our relationship has lasted 5 years. 
The trouble is I don’t have any family or friends and am something of a loner. When we met it was fantastic to have someone who wanted to share life with me. Like I said she was in a bad place when we first met and I took to helping her with everything I possibly could. 
I now come to realise that’s called codependency and it’s really not a good thing. 
Fast forward a couple of years and I’m now massively in debt and between us we’re paying it off but things changed. 
It became a struggle to make the money to service the debts and it drew a rift between us. Arguments start and resentment starts. 
I don’t resent her as such, I just wish I didn’t help as much as I did. When I bring up how stressed it makes me I’m told she didn’t ask for it. I offered. 
I guess she’s right, it is my fault. I just wanted more for her, I thought we was a team but now I realise whilst you can be a team on something’s, other stuff you’ve just got to let people do by themselves. Don’t help someone more than they want to help themselves I guess. 
Anyway, fast forward again to today and we’ve been broken up a week, I went and spoke to her yesterday, I tried sending a bit of a closure text but it got taken the wrong way and she replied in a very defensive way. 
I’m terrible at writing and even worse at expressing my feelings. 
Anyway , it came about that she’s been in contact with a girl that use to join us for 3sums, I accused her of cheating and she denied it and sent me a load of screenshots to prove her point. 
Trouble is , she says some stuff in them about me, that , well it’s just broken me. 
She talks about maybe wanting another baby if she finds the right person. She had an abortion 3 years ago. Which at the time was the right thing to do and I don’t hold anything against her for that, it still hurts to know that she does want another one - just not with me. 
She also says in these messages that its been over for her for a month and that she’s ruining her life by being with me. 
I’ve been feeling like its been over for her for months so at least I know I was right . 
But I’m so so so hurt, the only person I had in my life - gone and not just gone, she left feeling like I was ruining her life. 

I already feel so so low. I tired killing myself 2 months ago and I’m trying my best not to make any plans 

Everything I  read tells me to work on my self worth but all I keep doing is reading those messages and feeling absolutely worthless. How did it get so bad that I manage to turn the only person I had away"

What it feels like to have someone that never stops thinking about you or talks to the air imagining that you're nearby them

Somone who would send you messages while you slept because they had so much to say to you that they could talk forever

For everytime you've endured emotional pain they would weep because they weren't there to stop them from happening

Where even a item you wore is a treasure to them. They would cherish it and bring it everywhere they go because it has your scent on it

And when they go to bed they wish and cry so badly to see you in theirs dreams. Wanting you so badly to read them a story because your voice brings comfort to them

Dedicated to you where no one else exists. Wanting to know if you feel the same way about them. Worried if there is someone better now that could replace them

Having the fear of losing you. Not knowing what to do the next day without you or hearing from you. Even though you assure them otherwise

I know i will never be obsessed by anyone. Even though i yearn for the day for someone to make me feel special...but this will never happen"

I do this thing where I get reoccurring intrusive thoughts about suicide. It mentally feels like a wave of guilt and shame and wanting to die. (That part is like 5-10 seconds) then to snap out of that thought pattern, I have to do something physical. Usually I just mumble “I should just kill my self” and that stops the mental loop of guilt. Sometimes I physically twitch my head to the side, or shake my leg. In public I usually just tap my thumb to all my fingers to stop it in a more subtle way. I thought maybe there’s something more to it like autism or another factor im nit aware if cause Ive done this for pretty much my whole life And i sometimes do it without noticing.

throw_it_awayy966,2021-09-29 05:48:39+00:00,Slowly losing who I am,"It’s really hard for me to connect with people around me. I pretty much have no real friends and don’t feel liked by my family. Even the only couple people in the world that I’m close to doesn’t seem to be in the same page with me. I feel really lonely and have accepted that it will probably always be this way. 
Because I don’t connect with people, I realized I slowly stopped being the way I am. I slowly stopped sharing my ideas, the way feel, talking about things I like, etc. I guess it is because people around me are disinterested or annoyed when I’m talking about something I like or being me. I guess I take mental notes of those reactions and just stop doing those things. I think it’s causing me to lose my personality and lose who I am.
I respect myself enough not to pretend to talk about something I’m not actually interested in and or do things I don’t actually like doing, just to have people to talk to. I have tried to find friends that are interested in the things that I like and sometimes I do, but it’s like the only connection we have in just on one thing and that’s it. There are no other commonality there or our personality doesn’t mesh. How long can you keep talking about just one thing….. and be friends…
Not having anyone to talk about things that I like and be myself, it’s like I’m slowly editing my personality out. I say I respect myself to be not be someone else, but isn’t this basically being someone I’m not? 
It’s like what’s the point of existing if I’m just slowly erasing myself"

FewFaces_8,2021-09-28 23:05:59+00:00,my message to thous in a bad mood [part 1],"Hello everyone reading this post. This is actually my first post on this platform. That said, I am trying something I have never done before. I am writing this just to let all my thoughts to people who may have the same feelings so they understand that they are not alone.

Okay so I am a 19 years old guy currently located in Ukraine. I am studying in the second year of the Dutch university of Applied Science, unfortunately it is online for now because I have not found an apartment yet so I cannot move there. Starting a few months ago, a lot of my worries and stress has completely or almost vanished. I will count all the stuff that bothered me right now:

I am going to start off with the most bothering thing of my entire life, girls. So whenever I had a single physical interaction with any of them in public, like they would try to hug me or tough me, I would just freak out and feel a lot of stress which made me want to die in my head. Also, in public (school example) when a girl would talk to me I would never make an eye contact with her and I never tried to talk to them. I just felt some kind of subconscious pressure whenever there were any other men around me and a girl. Moreover, even in a private conversation with any girl I felt a pressure of me needing to constantly talk because whenever the pause would appear I felt like I want to die. I want to mention that the only thing I ever wanted in my life was to love someone. It was like the only thing that was interesting to me and the only reason I was close to the suicide multiple times. Okay so moving to the thing I found that caused that for me. Because I lived my entire like until now in Ukraine I want to mention that we have an 11th grade system in the school (just so you know). In the second grade of school, there was a first girl that I ever liked. I am going to say ""liked"" because I can clearly differentiate the like and love feeling for me. So back then, I don't remember how but some boys from the class found out about that I like this girl and after that they were teasing me and making fun of me. Non of them liked anyone as I remember. It felt like I was the worst of all because I was different in what I wanted at that age. I felt so much stress whenever they were making fun of me that I wanted to cry right in from of them. Later, when I was in the 4th grade I started to have a liking for another girl. Just a thought of anyone finding out about that was driving me crazy. But I had a few friend already at that time so I think some of them knew. So one day when there were almost all students in class, except that girl I liked, one guy that was taller, than me by a head called out my name. When I approached him, he said: ""Don't you like ""name"" girl from our class?"" as loud that everyone could hear him. At that moment I felt like just want to die and the only thing that I felt like doing is to jump on him and start fighting. That is exactly what I was doing. I never had an athletic body and still don't but he was huge, and I still had no fear. I just wanted to end everything right there. Btw, after that moment I never had a moment when I wanted to fight. So, I tried to punch him but the guys from class started to holding him and me. But I was like a wild animal back there. After 5th grade I changed school, where I spent one year studying. It really sucked. There were a lot of reason but I will tell them some other time. In 7th grade I was already in another school and it was better but there were also tough moments. Anyway, until like the end of the 2nd year of collage I never wanted to be in a relationship. (after 9th grade I studied 2 years in collage). It was more of a subconscious desire to not to have a relationship. That's what I thought. So until this time I was never thinking of creating any contact with girls. Now I realize it was because of teasing I got from the second and forth grade of school. Basically they completely devalued my desire of love. I was scared to show that to anyone because I may have been publicly made fun of. All of that was subconscious. I also always wanted to have physical connections. But whenever a girl would try to do that, I felt a lot of stress that someone would see that and would try to devalue my possible future desire to love again. It was like I was running from the fear that could never appear because nobody ever did that. Nobody did devalue anyone I knew so that actually would never appear to me in other schools but I still feared that. Also, not a single girl until the day I am writing that post has ever came to me and was interested in knowing me or having a relationships. It is as if due to the constant stress I was having related to girls, they never subconsciously wanted to approach me. I was just driving them away, even though I was never doing anything to them. But all of us have an opinion of a person just by looking at them, so I guess that what happened. Like would you like to be with a guy that is always stressed about something and he does not even realize of what? Btw, because of that girls never showed interest in me, I thought that I was the most worthless guy around. I thought that I was really ugly that nobody appeared but in reality nobody has ever told me till this day that I am ugly or something, it is exactly the opposite. However, under the circumstances of girls never liking me I was really stressed about my looks. I was mostly handing out with boys but I also knew that non of them would understand the other part of me that was always in shadows of my mind. These were feeling I had kept, the fears. I wanted to share all these thing to someone who would understand me. I always knew that girls would be like that but I could never approach them because of fear of teasing from men around. The stress related to my body was at the extend of me willing to not physically exist. I thought to myself that my ugly male body is related to the people I hated the most because I could only see bad about them back then, I mean men. I was disgusted by my genitals (just because they are male), weak body, and I though I had an ugly face. What I am trying to say is that all the stuff that that I just said appeared in my had in form of stress just because of innocent teasing form my starting years of school. It looks so simple but it is true because after I realized that I stopped hating my body and I don't feel so much stress related to girls.

There is actually a lot of stuff I haven't talked about yet like (my first love, fear of public places, hate towards all human kind, eye contact with people, etc) that is gone now but it is 2 am for me right now, so I will go to sleep. Thank you whoever you are for spending your time on this post. I hope that by writing more I can have at list a little of good impact on someone. Oh and sorry for any English mistakes."

azalaeos,2021-09-28 22:06:20+00:00,"I want help, but I keep putting it off.","I've been having some really intense suicidal thoughts lately. Enough that my therapist and I have discussed going to the hospital, but the thing is, I keep talking myself out of it for multiple reasons...

First, I start thinking that maybe it ""isn't bad enough"". Sure, I think about plans, but if it came down to it I don't know if I would actually go through with it, as much as I want to. I feel like I shouldn't go and waste people's time with this. Also, I start thinking that maybe it won't help anyways and what's the point of going then? I feel like I'm stuck in this limbo of wanting things to get better, but feeling like they won't and so I should just give up, but also feeling like I won't be able to go through with it - if that makes any sense at all lol.

Second, I'm worried that it's going to create more trouble for me when I get out. I've been telling my family that I am doing fine, and going in would mean that they would know I wasn't being honest with them and I really, really don't want to deal with that conversation because I feel like they will guilt trip me (even if it isn't on purpose). I'm also in college atm, and it would mean getting behind on courses and having to catch up later. My brain just goes ""nope,"" and automatically goes to ""if you were dead, it wouldn't be a problem."" And I start to think about it seriously, but if I messed up then I would be in the same situation anyways.

I don't know. I just feel very stuck, hopeless, and frustrated and ugh  I feel like I'm not trying hard enough or I'm doing this for attention, even though each day is a struggle. I guess I would really appreciate any advice - thank you!"
fenteap,2021-09-28 20:35:43+00:00,I’m so tired of depression. Meds are useless and therapy is a scam.,"I honestly just don’t even know what the fuck to do anymore 

I’m constantly distracting myself as much as possible from thinking about life 

I’m so tired of depression. I want to be fucking happy. Why don’t I know what I want in life? Why can’t I figure out why I want? 

I miss my ex partner so so so much. She’s the only person that ever made life worth living. A year later and she’s all I think about. 

I get so angry by depression on nights these days I become motivated to change my life. Then I realize, life won’t change in a day, or two, or a week, or even a month. It takes consistent effort and discipline to achieve happiness, and I can’t do that given my debilitating depression, that’s always there lurking in the background waiting to take me down.

Antidepressants fuck me up, take away my personality, make me feel like a zombie, and cause all sorts of nasty side effects and on top that don’t make me feel depressed, just nothing.  There’s no way this shit is made to solve depression. Just makes me feel like I’m fucking drugged up and cognitively impaired. 

Therapy sessions I’ve tried have all been therapists just parroting back what I say to make me feel understood, but they offer no solutions or epiphanies on life. If they had the fucking answers they wouldn’t be there working some job they hate.

I just don’t understand what to do with myself.

I even tried dying and almost passed out. That shit is hard. It’s hard to kill yourself. I want to fucking blow my head off but I’m a coward and I’m scared of the pain. 

I just want to be content."

MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-28 13:31:05+00:00,I only wake up to go back to sleep.,"The only reason I get out of bed at all is because my body can’t physically sleep 24 hours a day, if it could, that’s what it’d be doing. And when I do get up, I’m just desperately (and pretty unsuccessfully) trying to make the time not feel like it’s slowed to a crawl and pass enough of it so that I can sleep for as long as possible again. I take a bunch of melatonin every night to try to stave off my bouts of insomnia and keep me down for as long as possible, as quickly as possible.

I don’t want to be awake. Hell, I don’t want to be alive, by even killing myself takes effort. Already failed once. You might be mistaken for thinking I have more energy than I do cause I work out every day, but honestly, I mainly do it to pass the time quicker and because for the windows of time I do have to be awake, I already hate the way I look, so the stress of letting myself go would actually expend more energy than the exercise. Not that it helps, I still look like shit. But a lot of that is all the grotesque scars I’ve covered myself in. Sometimes I feel like I’d rather amputate my arm than have to look at them, but they’re all over me anyway, my arm’s just got the most.

But I don’t have any reason to be alive. There’s nothing I enjoy, nothing I want to do or be here for. I just exist. I’ve been treated like shit by almost everyone who’s entered my life, and the few that haven’t treated me like garbage didn’t fucking care anyway. I’ve never once had anyone just check in with me. Ever. Doesn’t fucking matter now though, I don’t have anyone in my life at all anymore. It’s just not worth it. There was no good and a ton of bad, so why subject myself to it? I just wish I could find some way not to feel so goddamn lonely all the time, it’s not like I want to interact with people anyway, so why does my brain make me suffer for a decision that’s really the only logical answer?

I know people say shit like “just enjoy the little things” but I don’t enjoy anything. Not big or little. I can’t remember what “enjoying” something even feels like, it seems alien to me. It’s been years. Nothing matters to me and I can’t just flip a switch to start enjoying things. I can’t just take a walk and “enjoy” nature or one of those other generic suggestions, I literally can’t remember how.

Therapy doesn’t help either. Years of therapy and multiple therapists hasn’t helped with any of it, not the anhedonia, the body image issues, the depression, the suicidal thoughts, the social problems, none of it. I feel worse now than when I started. Same thing with the medication, dozens and dozens of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, no effects whatsoever. No improvements or even negative side effects, just nothing. I can’t try any more specific treatments either, like ECT because I’ve been so depressed for so long that I can’t work so I can’t afford it. Tried more “experimental” treatments in the form of psychedelics too, cause that gets suggested a lot, and I hated every part of those experiences, again, it didn’t help at all.

I just don’t know what to do, I’m beyond burnt out on life, and I can’t even summon the motivation to kill myself, this is the worst I’ve ever felt and I’ve been stuck here for so long. I don’t know what to do."

I’m only 21. But it feels like my whole life is terrible. I feel either constantly like a burden or like I’m useless outside of my ability to help others. My grandmother is technically the only “father” I’ve know . My mom and my grndma forever argued and yelled growing up so I have so much anxiety and ptsd that hasn’t been properly dealt with. That anger from each other and outside things was always dealt out to me. I’ve always felt responsible for my younger sister because I didn’t want her to get the brunt end of my parent’s anger with each other. Any semblance of a father figure I’ve ever gained has always left me for one superficial reason or another. I’ve been assaulted numerous times by male peers over recent years because I make stupid decisions on who’s safe to be around. I feel like I search for love in the wrong places but what’s the right places. I’ve tried meds, I’ve tried cutting, I’ve tried therapy. I always find myself feeling I’d just be better off if I wasn’t on this earth. That life would go on and I’d just be a passing thought for everyone when they happened to remember I used to exist.

Sleeptillforever,2021-09-28 07:44:31+00:00,Need Advice,"(For context, I have Borderline Personality Disorder and severe Anxiety. I am also recovering from Depression and I have recovered from Anorexia) 

I’m very lost and confused. I am feeling depressed but unlike the other times I have been in a depressive episode I am not as bedridden. I can still do things. 

I am sometimes sleeping in quite late but I can easily convince myself to get into the shower. That was not the case when I was depressed in the past. 

I’m able to leave the house without much trouble if I have somewhere to be at a certain time, or am invited somewhere. That wasn’t the case in the past either. 

I have a boyfriend who I have been dating for 4 months now. I love him a lot. The interesting thing is… Being around someone who is not mentally ill has made me realise how different things are for me. 

My boyfriend socialises and sees his large group of friends often. On the other hand, I feel that I have unintentionally distanced myself from my few friends recently. I don’t feel connected at all. 

Earlier this year I was in a great place mentally and I was enjoying my hobbies. I spent a lot of time doing art, listening to music, going for walks in nature. I’ve realised that I don’t do any of this anymore. I feel like my attention span has decreased and everything feels like a waste of my time. I usually experience this in a depressive episode.

Lastly, I am beginning to have dark thoughts again. I’m not acting on them but they are definitely there. Thoughts of wanting to harm myself for example. I am struggling to feel that I deserve to look after myself because I believe I am not a good person. As a result of this I have also lost some weight recently. This is not related to my previous ED though. It’s more like I’m too lazy to prepare myself proper food so I will eat meals that aren’t exactly nutritious. I also believe the weight loss is caused by the fact that I’ve been smoking a lot of cigarettes and also weed.

My therapist thinks I am doing really well. I feel that I am holding back quite a bit in my sessions with her in the last few months especially (AKA since things have gone down hill again). She has told me that she feels I am holding back information about what’s going on. She pointed out my weight loss and asked if I was smoking cigarettes or doing drugs… I told her I wasn’t doing either. I don’t know why I lie about those things. I think I don’t like to make her worry because in the past my honesty has resulted in therapists admitting me to the psych ward or straight up telling me that I was lying or exaggerating. 

So my question is, do I need to admit to her that I am depressed again? Am I even depressed? I don’t feel the way I felt when I was depressed all of the other times. To make things worse, she has been my therapist for 3 or so years, but since I am 18 now I won’t be seeing her much longer. That makes me wonder what’s the point of opening up to her if we won’t be continuing our sessions much longer."

I don’t know if it was intentional, I don’t believe it was, but either way he is gone. I met him 10 years ago, in middle school, and we have been friends ever sense. He helped me through the hardest, darkest, parts of my life and was always supportive of me. I could talk to him about anything, the amount of trust I had in him doesn’t happen often. 

He was the first person I ever truly fell in love with. I love him with every fiber of my being. I am so fucking mad, but I’m also in so much pain. It’s such a conflicting feeling, I’ve never been through this. 

I’ve sent him several messages, secretly hoping that he will answer me back. That this was all a mistake, that he is alive. I know this isn’t going to happen, but I can’t bring myself to accept that he is gone. 

I have so many emotions and thoughts going through my head constantly, I’m so tired. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for several years, but I’ve been in a generally good place.

I used to pride myself on being able to do fine although I was suffering, but now i’m not fine and I have nothing to own up to but disappointment and being the gloomy person that ruins everyone’s day. :(

I feel like i’m stuck here and  not able to do the things that I used to love, and even simple tasks like tidying my room and completing my hw assignments my time. It’s all  gone way out of control and I can’t seem to get a grasp and get shit done despite all my effort as well as those around me. (I have talked to doctors and I am currently on anti-depressants) 

My biggest issue is that no one is really listening to me when they  ask what I need. Sometimes I just want to talk and vent and be gloomy. I don’t want a bunch of solutions to fix my problems and idc whether  they work or don’t. I just don’t want to be ignored. I have only one friend that I talk to about everything and they recently got annoyed and upset at me for not taking their advice and solutions about some problems I was talking about. It made me extremely sad and left me feeling kind of exposed  and like I shouldn’t have said anything in order to not cause them trouble. I understand they have feelings too and it’s not their job to be my “Therapist” but it really left me feeling completely alone. 

My friend said they couldn’t just sit and listen to me complain especially if I wasn’t going to do what they were suggesting, I tried to explain to them that I wasn’t looking for answers I was looking to be heard and just get my feelings out to someone else but they didn’t understand. 

Am I they only one who feels this way? I don’t necessarily want to be/stay depressed but it’s how i’m feeling and nobody is recognizing it. Everyone is just giving me bullshit fake-ass positivity that makes me angry and annoyed and I just want people to see that i’m hurting."

I've dealt with depression and anxiety for years; more so consistently + recently than ever.  The past two years, I moved away from my family and friends to a state where I knew no one and started my life over, with my boyfriend (now fiancee) and while it's great we're still together, it's been hell on my emotional well being from day 1.

We are moving back to my home state very soon and getting married in 17 days but good lord I am an emotional roller coaster lately.  For the past 3-4 months I cry every day.  I can't find joy in anything (not even this wedding or the fact I'm moving back home to everything that means the world to me).  I can't sleep at night and I'm tearing up even typing all of this out right now.  I understand and acknowledge I have a great life and am thankful/grateful but still am so very sad.  I cannot bring myself to love myself and compare myself to others ALL.OF.THE.TIME and feel like I give so much to others and do not get the same back except from my mother and some from my fiancee. 

I feel like I've been on the verge of a serious mental breakdown but what for? I'm leaving the place that I hate (great news), I'm marrying this guy (even better news) but it's like I cannot for the life of me be happy.  Lately, I've been reading into HSP (Highly Sensitive People) and I think I 100% check all of the boxes.  I want to overcome this or at least control it because I see it's starting to take a toll on my fiancee and our relationship but clearly it's taking over my life.

Has anyone dealt with this? Nonstop unhappiness? Crying every day? Trying to self love but can't? Being a highly sensitive person + controlling it?

Hello, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend who I also consider my bestfriend. My life is not going very well at the moment and I feel like this was kinda the last straw. He told me he has some problems with his mental health and feels like he needs some time to himself. He says that if he can not care for me (because of the state he is in) then there's no point in staying together. To give some context we started as fuck buddies right after he broke up with his ex and then got into a serious relationship but have never said ""I love you"" to each other. He told me that he is feeling insecure about our relationship because of this as well. I feel like I am not enough for him even though I am putting my heart into this relationship. I feel so insecure because he loved his ex so much... I often ask myself what do I not have that she does? I admit that I am not a very easy person to deal with since I come from a past of emotional trauma and abuse and feel unconforable doing various things like complimenting him and saying he looks cute and so on. This and some other behaviors bother him but are not the cause of the way he is feeling. I am feeling very overwhelmed by this whole situation given the fact that I do not have a job and my family is really struggling financially. I've been finding myself having thoughts about self harm and have had various anxiety attacks where I feel like I have a huge weight on my chest and can't breathe or breathe rapidly. I have not eaten anything in 2 days and I feel like if I were to eat I would throw up.
To top it all off he also said that he was scared to break up with me because of my current suicidal thoughts. When he said this I felt horrible, I felt that even without meaning it I've been manipulating him. I feel horrible, I don't know what to do but I know for a fact that I can't go on like this. He is the only joy in my life and I think that if I were to actually lose him I wouldn't be able to cope.He told me to give him some time but I don't know if I can hold on that long. I feel like I've lost a piece of my heart. I wrote this on a whim since I don't have any friends apart from my boyfriend. Leaving aside this situation I also can't find a job because there aren't any where I'm leaving and can't afford university. I don't know what to do with my life I feel like I don't have any perspectives. All I am thinking about in the last two days are dark thoughts about how maybe harming myself will alleviate this pain which I know it won't but it seems like I can't think rationally right now."
itsmeemya,2021-09-27 06:08:32+00:00,I need someone to listen to me I can’t handle this pain anymore," I’m an 18 year old female I grew up with divorced parents they divorced when I was a baby so I’ve never seen them together but they have both moved around a lot because of their jobs so I would only stay in one place for three years at the most growing up. I suffered from self harm in middle school due to drama, a boy and being an outcast I’m 5 years cleans btw :). My sophomore and junior year I was in a toxic relationship just emotionally wise (we were both in really bad places at the time) and I smoked weed all the time and did psychedelics once a month so it kinda cause my brain to become dead. Two months ago I moved to a new town it is my senior year and sadly I live in a military installation. I have one friends and I’m eye candy to boys but I can’t hangout with people due to not being able to drive and work. My whole life ive had a hard time getting close with people and by the time I’d have a bestfriend it would be time for me to move. I’ve become shy and my mental health is jus everywhere rn I can’t even describe it. I’ve finally figured out where I want to go to college, I have all As and a good job. It has never been like this, a couple months ago I was a pothead who didn’t know what they wanted to do with there life but I got to travel Europe this summer. I was so happy and finally straightened myself up. The one problem I still have is building good relationships. I don’t know how to get close to people anymore. Everyone says I’m kind and pretty but I guess it’s not enough. The routine now is go to school, go to work then go home and sit on my phone all day. My little sister has had an attitude since I been here but when I don’t stay downstairs she seems happy so I’ve been keeping to myself. I know this isn’t healthy but I have no means of transportation to see my one friend or hangout with the guys that like me. I find myself getting attached easily, I FaceTimed a guy I liked and he was so quiet and would keep talking about football so I didn’t know what to say so we hung up. I cried for an hour and not because of him but because of how lonely I am. I crave affection I want a hug, I wanna feel loved. It’s so hard and I know my life isn’t bad it just sucks being alone. The only thing keeping me from taking my life is knowing that if I did people would be sad. I don’t know what to do I can’t stand this anymore I’m so tired of it I feel like I’m going insane and I hope no one feels the way I do because it sucks."

throw147484826,2021-09-27 02:51:14+00:00,I hurt my ex.,"Hey, this isn’t a normal post. But I’ve got a long, complicated story. But for the last 6-8 months I can’t outthink the thoughts about it. The whole ordeal started about 2 years ago, one night my ex called me up saying that she got a bottle of alcohol( I think captain Morgan or jack Daniels ) and she said she wanted to share it. So I drove over to her parents house since we were both in high school at the time. We both started drinking, I had a third of the bottle and she had 2/3 of the bottle. She asked if I wanted to have sex and I said yes. We had sex for about an hour when at some point I had asked if I could take a video, she said yes again, and at this point both of us have had sex drunk and had taking videos whilst having sex, but neither at the same time. But regardless, it felt like an otherwise normal night in our relationship at that point in time. But the following morning I woke up with a hangover and when I unlocked the phone to see the video in my camera roll. So when I went to her house that day I went ahead and showed her, she explained that she had felt uncomfortable about the whole experience and wanted me to delete the video so I did. But following that day I can’t recall ever really talking about that night to any degree other than the one time we got super drunk. We were sexually active together as well up until October of 2020 when I had caught her cheating on me, then following that I got covid-19 and was sick until December of 2020. At this point I was starting to have some anxiety attacks and ptsd-like symptoms of some experiences that happened to me as a child (SA/rape related). I went to my partner and I briefly explained I needed someone to talk too about what had been going on. She replied that I needed to seek therapy since she wasn’t qualified nor did she feel comfortable talking about it with me since she had a childhood experience very similar. But in March of 2021 shortly before our anniversary I grew worried she was cheating on me again since she would make any excuse not to see me and her messages were super short. I knew something was up. But we ended up arguing and at first she said she was depressed I told her I’d help her and all the works, but out of the blue she dropped this message telling me that for since 6 months- a year following the night we got drunk she doesn’t feel comfortable around me, she said I reminded her of her childhood rapist and that even thinking of me ruined her day. We took a two week break witch resulted in us breaking up, during her breakup texts she told me that I traumatized her and that I was a monster. She asked me to never speak to her again and I’ve respected those wishes. But ever since we broke up I’ve been carrying eminence feelings of guilt. She’s become a trigger for my ptsd attached to my own childhood rape. Every time I even think about her, her family,friends,dogs or even memories with her in it, I go into an attack that knocks me on my ass. This happens every single day, usually multiple times a day. I’m not scared of what people think of me or the reproductions of what happened. I’m scared of the fact I tuned into the same kind of man that raped me as a child. My therapist I’ve been seeing tells Me that she gaslight me and emotionally abused me. But it still never stops these issues I’ve been having. I know full well I would’ve never ever done this if it were just her drunk, or if she had said no, my ex told me it didn’t matter that I was drunk as well and she had agreed to everything that had happened. She told me it wasn’t consent if she couldn’t remember and if she felt shocked the next day. I’m not looking for sympathy or anything. I want an honest answer if I’m a monster. I have night tremors and panic attacks every day. I cannot turn myself in due to the fact that I didn’t break a law, I even spoke to a family friend who is a detective at the local police department. If I can’t turn myself in, if I can’t rectify this situation by doing something for her ( The only thing I can do is not contact her ), then what can I do. I desperately want to wire her what money I have left and end it. I’ve already come on Reddit for help with this but I’m even more lost. I don’t want to die, but I see no way to fix this or make this right for her. I’m really sorry for what I’ve done and I never meant to hurt her but that doesn’t change the fact I hurt her. Sorry."

Little did I know that there was absolute dreadness waiting for me. I never thought I would be crying everyday, I was a strong person. And the cause for this crying is loss, loss of my previous life. 

I lost my pleasure in video games

I lost all forms of social contact

I lost physical social interaction, everything's online now.

Now nothing remains except a few TV shows. Completely aimless, no future plans

Honestly I should've died the day I achieved my goal, there's no reason to live anymore. I've got no loved ones, just me. Let's see how long I can bear this."

i promise i didn’t break it, i don’t know why he reacted that way. he doesn’t even clean the kitchen. i ran upstairs crying. i wish i could control my emotions. i told to myself “i want to die already” while i walked upstairs. 

that’s sad, how that phrase is my immediate reaction to the slightest inconvenience. there’s something really wrong with me. 

anyways, this is pointless. i’ll just be more careful, avoid conflicts and hopefully those negative thoughts go away. i’m just so tired from everything."
Str8As,2021-09-26 19:33:33+00:00,Being Alone,"""Just be yourself"" is probably the weakest thing to imagine in this day and age if you expect to have any form of meaningful social bond with people. Tried (do note the word try, as I have tried other things as well) to socialize with an exaggerated positivism and happiness from what I feel inside, but it has only created shallow bonds with people and a sense of incompleteness for myself. You might think that they see through this, but they don't.  
If I act myself around others, which is a more logical and calm self, then they are simply not interested in dealing with me on a personal level. I just ended a 6 year long relationship due to her using me financially (among other things). I then moved to a larger city and gave a shot at talking to a few interesting girls, being just myself, but zero interest shown back. Quite the other way, messages end up in the void along with my confidence. My social skills aren't bad, but from what I've learnt in my 29 years is that my interests and tastes are not that common, and creates a dissonance when talking to other people.  


Might leave the city to live in a hut with a dog. Hermit checking in."

That Time is over now, i was caught in wrong hopes, sad lies and false promises. Suicide seems like an act of sweet mercy to me, like a fresh breeze in a Hot Summer day. I could end it, the pain would be gone and my life that has no purpose could come to a long lasting end. And if People will read what made me Suffer maybe they would understand.

Maybe they would feel relifed knowing that my sadness came to an end.

Throw_away210921,2021-09-26 13:28:56+00:00,This is a horrible illness.,"My head is absolutely battered, broken.
I’m by far the person I used to be, so much different. 
I’m negative, I care so much about what people think, I’m horrible to people who love me. 

My day goes, Im in bed till 12, I get up smoke weed go back to bed. And the only time I do anything , is to smoke in my shed. I guess it’s a coping mechanism, I’m just failing and failing.

I know that my head is bruised, and one day it’ll be it. I’ve tried so many times in the past to die, I’ve caused misery upon my family, my friends, myself. 

Everytime I feel this way, I can’t go back down the suicide route because it’s so much negativity on my family.
I’m terrified of standing on the edge, about to drop 70ft, I stand there not having enough balls to just drop. To drop that’s all it takes, I just haven’t got it in me.

Drug overdoses, I’ve died a couple times. I just don’t know why I always wake back up.I wake back up to even more misery I was in!

I’ve tried psychedelics to try help with the way I feel, maybe to try better myself or to just find an escape. However I know once I finally have the balls to take 5meo, hopefully I can face death so I’m not so scared of it after all.

I know the day is coming up, but I’m not sure when. It’s always on my mind and the feeling of being gone forever hurts me, but somewhere inside it pleasures me.

I was such a great kid. Until life stuff happens."

All this time I've been thinking my life wasn't working for me. But yesterday I felt I was the off thing in my life.

SMO_Jake,2021-09-26 06:13:06+00:00,I’m rly on fucking edge,"So I’m not suicidal or anything, but this has prolly been the toughest stretch in my life. To make it even worse, nobody on Reddit ever responds to my posts except for bots. (If u happen to see this, plz send some comments I would rly appreciate them). 

Context, I’m (20m) a sophomore in college who has never been in any romantic relationship ever and I want that to change very badly. Downloaded 7 dating apps, only a few real matches (not counting bots and Snapchat girls), only one of which I actually went out with, which I got blocked and ghosted by only a few days later. Tinder and bumble, arguably the most authentic dating/hookup apps, I’ve had zero matches respond to my dms. 

All my high school buddies r at different colleges, and I haven’t made any sort of new friends yet (4 weeks in) and I’m afraid that now if I try it will be awkward since most ppl have found their crowd. 

My self confidence is very low, as I see most ppl who walk by me put their heads down right as I pass and it just hurts so fucking much. I’m a big introvert so I’ve made minimal efforts to communicate with ppl, and those ppl have never reciprocated that connection ever. I’m a rly nice guy if u get to know me but ppl r not even interested in the slightest engagement with me.

I’ve gotten a few girls’ snaps from the dating apps, but they rarely respond and leave me on read all the time. I joined a video game club at my college but they haven’t had a single event yet. 

I’ve just been so desperate and I’m so fucking tired. My sleep schedule is fucked, and getting papers and homework assigned on a daily basis makes things 10x worse. 

So I’m in a rly bad place rn. I give off the image to my family etc. that I’m doing fine bc I don’t want anyone to worry about me cuz I don’t wanna be a bother. I’m at the stage of where idk who to ask for help, so internet strangers is my last hail marry for any kind of support. 

I just want to feel loved by someone (f) non family related so bad cuz I’ve definitely had times where I need someone to support me in that way (like now for ex). No matter what I do, I’m in this daily cycle of just getting though the day without any progress being made no matter how hard I try. 

If u made it this far thx for the read, and any sort of comments on this post would mean the world to me. I’m so lonely and sad literally all the time."

I feel like everyone around is going through life so easily. Getting married and buying houses and going on elaborate vacations. I feel like there must be something wrong with me because of how much I’m struggling. I know that there are people who care about me and anytime they need a friend or a listening ear I’m there because being semi helpful is the only way I can actually earn my right to take up space in this world, but when I try and reach out for something as simple as a distraction from my thoughts let alone any kind of real help I never get it. Their always too busy. I know if I sat and talked to them about how I desperately need someone to show me attention they would understand and help but the only thing I can even offer anyone anymore is being decent company and low maintenance. I’m afraid that if I become a hassle everyone’s gonna realize how shit I am and leave for good. I just feel alone and afraid and I don’t have the energy to try and be more that a disappointment anymore.

edit: a major thing that started recently is when i usually have that weird weight feeling lifted (eg start of weekend) i was just left with a intense bad feeling again"

I can't keep living like this it hurts me so much"
xlushbabyx,2021-09-25 22:03:06+00:00,Feeling so many emotions at once,"First of all, I feel like I’m never good enough when it comes to jobs and working. I’ll probably be stuck with being paid minimum wage forever, I really don’t want to work forever. I also don’t have any talents, skills, or any passion to start anything. 

Secondly, being asexual sucks. All the expectations are going to follow me later on, and I will forever struggle with money (that’s what it feels like), therefore I’ll never find out. It gives me comfort to know that I’ll be dead soon. Life just doesn’t feel enjoyable, and I feel like I’ll never find true love. 
I’m so insecure, and I get jealous very easily. I’m not confident in my own skin/body. 
Last but not least, there are just too many evil people on this planet. An incident happened the day before yesterday, which also added on to the way I’m feeling. I just feel like I’m probably gonna be killed or some shit because that’s just what’s happening in this world right now.  There is just no humanity and kindness in this world. 

Idk what to do. Everywhere I go and for anyone, I’m just not enough. I tend to overthink situations."

I've been dealing with burnout from work(plus a new GM whos trying to change us all which is causing alot of ppl to wanna walk out including me) im giving myself 3 weeks till im either terminated or I do walk out.

I have something going on with a family member that's causing me to royalty screw up at work. I mean i know what and how I'm going to approach the situation at hand just need time to do it.

Dealing with heartbreak. I fell for someone who i have no chance with(its complicated). Letting go of them has been so difficult and hard. Why does some heartbreak hurt worse than others? 

Ive reached the point of loss of appetite and all I wanna do is sleep.

I know things can be worse but eventually things will be okay and will work out but yeah im just walking through a dark tunnel with the light very far in the distance."

duffman626,2021-09-25 20:18:04+00:00,What to do when everything seems to be going wrong in your life?,"So I've been feeling really shitty lately. Just seems like everything in my life seems to be going wrong. A few years ago my health started getting bad in terms of digestive problems and a few other training injuries. Ive been back and forth to doctors, but no real clear diagnosis.

I also stopped working out because of injuries and I lost a ton of weight which really depressed me and lost motivation as my years of hard gym work were going away. 

I seemed to have drifted away from all the people I use to be friends with from school/ uni. As soon as I stopped seeing then I drifted and didn't stay in contact. The same could be said for them aswell though as they never once called me to see if I was well or anything. Which makes me wonder were they ever even friends in the first place?

I stopped going out to socialise because of covid and also because I hadn't any friends to. 

The current job I'm in I hate and I don't get on with alot of my coworkers as I'm very introverted and don't like group settings which is probably why I need to get another job.

I recently rote off my car because of a bad tyre and going too fast around a bad corner. 

Im just looking to know if anyone else wonders what their purpose is in life and why everything seems to be going wrong when you try and be positive. 

Didn't mean to rant just giving some pointers as why I feel this way."

Days pass by in the same process; for days ,weeks , just a continuous pattern of the same miserable life I live.
 
No aspirations, no motivation, no joy.

How can I live a happy, motivated, enjoyable life when there’s absolutely nothing in me to get there.
I’m surrounded by so much negativity and anger that I dread to open my eyes.

The only time I feel at bliss is when there’s nobody around, when I’m alone, when I remember I have myself. All the moments I’ve been in desperate need of help, I’ve been alone.

I continue to act happy to hold a family together. 

The people around me are getting sick of me, and I’m ashamed to agree with them. I was such a joyful kid, I had ambitions, dreams and a solid insight into my future.

I’ve just been battered by depression, ptsd and anxiety. I’m just so weak, I don’t have the energy to fix it. 
The only pleasure I get from my day is knowing I’m going to appreciate my sleep. The moment I close my eyes and let all escape!"

To clarify I mean like a sensory overload. Or just exhaustion, not sure what to call it. I’ve never get this way before in my depressive episodes, but I’ve had to quarantine with my family so sleeping with them is horrendous. I was never bothered by them before but since I’ve been in a bad place since yesterday the noises they make in their sleep (my father snores, my mother breathes very loud, and my sister makes random noises) just annoys the hell out of me.

I don’t know how I’m going to finish my degree because I’m running out of money. I can’t work because of COVID-19. My mom, whom I live with, is very vulnerable to the virus. So I cannot work because I live with her. I have been struggling to get a masters degree for seven years! Seven whole years! I am running behind on my reading and studying! I think I have adhd which makes it harder for me to focus and study. This is why it’s taken me so long to finish school. I have so much credit card debt and debt from the irs. I have considered getting a job online but I don’t know what job I could get because I lack skills. All of these factors in life, have caused me to become suicidal. I don’t have any immediate plans but I think about suicide every day. I feel like I hate my life and I hate myself. I’m tired of struggling. My family is threatening to kick me out if I don’t finish graduate school. They are tired of me living with them because we always fight and argue about how long it is going to take me to finish school. I really wish I could get myself together but it’s so hard. Most of the time  I wish I didn’t exist.

I already see a therapist. That is not helping."

I see everyone around me - they’re living the life. They’re camping in their new RV’s, buying fancy houses, travelling, getting great new jobs, they have kids, and they walk around like life is this fucking beautiful ride. I work just as hard and get kicked in the box and all I can say is: “thank you sir.”

I’m beginning to realize this is just how it is. I’m part of the compost. As I ferment I produce tax dollars for the system for everyone to live better lives. My service through work helps everyone else. I’m here to hold the door open for them. I’m a lower class.

  The sky has billions of stars that light it up, I have two or three depending on a girl. My mom and dad are the main two. My parents lights have always been just enough to keep me going but these last few months have been really rough and they're not enough anymore. Luckily for me I found a girl who got my humor and was nice as can be to me and for a about 4 weeks she's been the brightest light in the sky for me but she ended up rejecting me and her light dimmed almost all the way. Now I'm worried because these lights are the only thing keeping me alive and my dads light is slowly going out. My dad has Cancer bad and when he's gone there's not going to be enough light to keep me from blowing my brains out and finding out how bad hell really is. I've tried to explain my situation to many people and I always get the same response, ""I know what you're going through it gets better "" no the fuck it doesn't. My dad isn't just going to magically heal. These people live in nice big houses with both parents that have no problems with them at all so how can they even begin to understand what I'm going through? On top of that my ""friends"" have all turned their backs on me when I need them most. They've decided I'm going downhill fast and that I need to grow up. Please someone give me some words of wisdom here. I used to be in a family that never had to worry about bills or payments because my dad had a job but now I might be homeless in a month shit I don't know."

this week has been mentally and emotionally heavy, i don’t really know why but i just feel like crying for every single thing and everything inside me build up pretty quickly. i don’t know how to explain it but a weird sensation fills my body and my wrists begin hurting, like if they were asking to be split. 

i’m not allowed to go out bc of covid to see anyone. i don’t like that but at the same time it makes me feel safe because i really can’t interact with people anymore, it makes me so anxious and i try to get myself out there but it’s terrible. my mom told me today that maybe she would let me go out to see any friends i’d like to. the problem is i don’t have any real friends anymore. during quarantine i ruined all my friendships and that made me very sad, even if they might consider me their friend, they don’t even considerate inviting me anywhere anymore because i’m not allowed to anymore so they just forgot i exist. 
i don’t blame them, i’m a burden.

everything keeps going downhill and i’m too weak to handle it. i don’t know what to do with my existence. a teenager like me should be living her life. i know that the situation w covid is difficult but i just see everyone living their lives and i just wish that was me. sorry that sounds selfish, i know that many people are having a bad time and i sound so stupid.

I’ve had one girlfriend which is pretty fucking pathetic and more so she cheated on me and that was kinda the last straw for my mental health. After that I just went numb I haven’t felt truly happy since her. All I feel is sadness and empath to make up for not giving a shit what happens to me.

Basically my boyfriend right now i feel has set up our relationship to fail. He’s cheated in the beginning, didn’t want to even be together but did it because he got tired of me asking, sent a girl money while inbetween jobs and i was paying for everything, lied so much, offered to pay for another girls hotel room and stay the night with her to show her around (i live in a big city) but when i would visit him (we used to be long distance) he never offered that. I gave him money because he wasn’t working to find out later he had a savings in his house. And just time and time again he’s shown me through actions i don’t really matter to him. Now this is from the beginning of our relationship. All the “drama” stopped two years ago we’ve been together for 4 and talked for 1 so five years total. Everything’s okay now but i can’t help but think about before. I was willing to move on but now he’s hell bent on never marrying me and like i finally get it I’m not it for him and that’s fine i guess I’ve changed a lot since we’ve met and I’m not as eager to prove I’m “loveable” so i wouldn’t allow this treatment again at my age now (30) but to know he doesn’t want to marry me it’s like a slap in the face like wow i tolerated and did so much and for nothing i guess. 

He doesn’t believe in marriage ..sigh and this is always my situation I’m always runner up or some consolation prize and then like i said earlier i go into “let me be super loving to prove I’m loveable” mode. And i know I’m not old or anything but my hope for dating is gone and that makes me sad. I truly think I’ll end up alone and i grew up alone as well.  Only child with an abusive step father. I just want to experience being loved

ScaredInteraction248,2021-09-24 21:33:30+00:00,I hate myself.,"I hate myself. And everyday I just learn how to hate myself a little more. Lately I feel like it's pointless to try hard and make efforts. I don't feel like pushing myself to the best anymore. 

Two years ago I failed college because of work, so when people around me were graduating I couldn't help but think that I was a shame, a looser, a dumbass... I' d stop believe in myself so I drop off college and start working a full time job instead. 
I couldn't take it anymore and was scared to blame people for my mistakes, so I just started to cut myself, and pretended that everything was fine. Everytime I felt bad, hopeless, depressed, dumb, unworthy, vexed... I would hide and cut myself because it was my only moments of peace and this way I was sure to not hurt people with words. But when i couldn't cut myself immediately, I would go to WC, taking off my pant and scratching my cuts, just to hurt myself, just to feel something. It ended up being an addiction. 

But last year, I've finally grown some hopes after I saved money. So I've stopped hurting myself, I moved out and start school again (for a session of two years) and this time in something I love. When I felt bad or sad, cutting myself wasn't my first option anymore. It was so natural. I was able to think clearly and found good and healthy solutions to problems. 

But at the end of the year, I failed again and didn't get my diploma (the diploma I require doesn't have a big impact on a professional career, but still, I wish I had it). Thankfully, even without diploma I was able to attend the second and last year of school without problem. They even gave me a chance to redo my final exam next week (and maybe get my diploma).

But right now I can't help but hate myself. Due to Covid I had some financial issues and my saving money drop low very fast. But for this second year I asked for financial support when I learned that we were eligible to some. I shared this information with some friends and thanksfully they got financial help. But when I ask for it, I didn't got it. I didn't understand why I was the only who was refused so I contest the decision. Right now I'm waiting for an answer but I'm scared it will be no again. I'm scared I will have to work to pay my tuition again. 
I'm so mad at myself for being stupid. I'm so mad to repeat the same mistake. I think I may be traumatized, I hate myself so much. I'm scared my past will repeat again and I will failed because of work. I'm scared not being able to concile work and school. Right now I really want to cut myself but I'm scared to be punish twice more and never get a chance to get what I wish for. I'm scared that madness, sadness, blame and hate are the only things I deserve. I'm scared to fail the exam again. I'm scared I won't get financial support. I'm afraid everything I've worked for is crumbling. I'm so afraid of being a shame. I'm scared to be an dishonor, again for the XXXXXX times. 

To be honest, I' wish I didn't learnt to appreciate and love myself last year. Because it would have been easier to hurt myself. I hate myself so much but I can't harm me. I miss cutting my thighs. I really hate myself. I can't help but feel sick and nauseous. I want to throw up but can't get anything out. I just hate myself. I hate myself so much that I forbid myself from crying. When I can't hold back I start crying and immediately stopped because I don't feel sad anymore just mad at myself."

But at the end of the year, I failed again and didn't get my diploma (the diploma I require doesn't have a big impact on a professional career, but still, I wish I had it). Thankfully, even without diploma I was able to attend the second and last year of school without problem. They even gave me a chance to redo my final exam next week (and maybe get my diploma).

But right now I can't help but hate myself. Due to Covid I had some financial issues and my saving money drop low very fast. But for this second year I asked for financial support when I learned that we were eligible to some. I shared this information with some friends and thanksfully they got financial help. But when I ask for it, I didn't got it. I didn't understand why I was the only who was refused so I contest the decision. Right now I'm waiting for an answer but I'm scared it will be no again. I'm scared I will have to work to pay my tuition again. 
I'm so mad at myself for being stupid. I'm so mad to repeat the same mistake. I think I may be traumatized, I hate myself so much. I'm scared my past will repeat again and I will failed because of work. I'm scared not being able to concile work and school. Right now I really want to cut myself but I'm scared to be punish twice more and never get a chance to get what I wish for. I'm scared that madness, sadness, blame and hate are the only things I deserve. I'm scared to fail the exam again. I'm scared I won't get financial support. I'm afraid everything I've worked for is crumbling. I'm so afraid of being a shame. I'm scared to be an dishonor, again for the XXXXXX times. 

To be honest, I' wish I didn't learnt to appreciate and love myself last year. Because it would have been easier to hurt myself. I hate myself so much but I can't harm me. I miss cutting my thighs. I really hate myself. I can't help but feel sick and nauseous. I want to throw up but can't get anything out. I just hate myself. I hate myself so much that I forbid myself from crying. When I can't hold back I start crying and immediately stopped because I don't feel sad anymore just mad at myself."

VaguelyVivid-UWOT,2021-09-24 19:18:39+00:00,Dead boys - ain't it fun,"These past few months have been a nightmare and the months before it were a blur. Before last year I was sober for 3 years and relapsed massively resulting in two accidental drug overdoses that had me picked up off the ground and brought back to life. Before my relapse(s) life was unbearable in lockdown. Living in a very toxic environment and finding myself down the ER with massive 'fake heart attack' panic episodes.

I got through medically assisted detox here in Ireland and back to work, trying to resume my life with some stability and normality. However, it has been an up and down rollercoaster and especially difficult these past few weeks.

I feel like a lab rat that has had their dopamine / reward system removed and I can't find the motivation to do my work or anything terribly productive, which results in a negative feedback loop with all of the old familiar scripts playing.

In an effort to find some motivation or just something so I can at least do my work and not lose my job, I purchased some Kratom and modafinil. It has helped somewhat but I know it's risky business to be self-medicating and I will likely throw it all in the bin soon.

This isn't a post about my struggles with addiction but all of the stuff that lives and has lived under my forms of escapism for too long. I'm working with two therapists, engaging in support and take Mirtazapine at night but fuck, I am just sick of everything right now and at times, I wish that they didn't bring me back to life.

I'm under no illusion that life is supposed to be rosy everyday but surely there has to be some answers to these enduring issues!

Wishing you all the best on whatever journey you're on"

myheartisfucked,2021-09-24 15:18:29+00:00,I’ve (30M) become broken since a filled relationship and HPV diagnosis,"I broke up with my girlfriend in May. This is the only person I have ever felt true unconditional love for. In fact the only time I’ve ever felt genuine love in a relationship. I didn’t even know I could feel this prior to her. I did it because she wants children and I don’t and the longer we stayed the worse it would be in the future.  I told her she needs to meet somebody who can provide that for her. 

  I also a few months later noticed genital warts. We both were sick together with covid and the physical stress of that coupled with the mental stress of breaking up could have caused it to activate. It makes it extra difficult because she loved me so much and I know would have stayed with me end supported me.  I mean it’s possible she even gave it to me, but she doesn’t know I have it. She has diagnosed anxiety and I don’t wanna mention it if it’s not needed. 

  It’s now been like 4ish months and I thought I was doing good.  I see she posted a story of the new guy she is dating. It absolutely crushed me and I had an almost panic attack. I’ve never had a therapist before, but I’m actively searching for one now. 

  We speak every now and then and last night she called me. I told her how broken down I was when I saw the story and also told her that I’m still happy she met somebody. In a way I truly am. 

  The other side of me wants to try and win her back. I’ve been thinking and believe I didn’t want kids just cause I was scared of the responsibility.  I just can’t believe I let go the only person I’ve ever loved and initiated it even. 

  Before her I was a happy go lucky single guy and having a great time in life. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I was doing ok prior to this past Saturday in the sense that I wasn’t happy, but I was accepting of the situation. 

  I really feel like my life without her is meaningless. She was such a great person and in my time with her I improved myself as a person so much because of her love and support.  I think her and I really should be together. I’m just scared of causing her further grief and pain. 

  I’m also scared that I’ve regressed and I’m not the man she even fell in love with. I’m physically in good shape cause I used exercise as a stress relief and I’m in a decent financial situation. Mentally though I feel broken and not myself"

Vanilla_UwU,2021-09-24 10:43:28+00:00,I Feel Human Again,"I’ve had depression since I was 11 (19 now btw). It worsened with trauma that happened when I was 14. My specific trauma was being in an emotionally abusive relationship. One of the most impactful moments was when my girlfriend made fun of me with her friends for having gender dysphoria. My depression got extremely bad for a while and after I graduated I went to college for a semester and now I haven’t been in school for almost a year and only just now got a job. In the past 3-4 years I haven’t cried a single time from emotions or pain because sadness was my normal emotion. There’s a certain song my ex liked that linked itself to my trauma with her. Today I reflected on a lot of my life while listening to that song on repeat and I cried for the first time in at least 3 years. My crying started off being only pain but then I got happy because I was crying. Me crying showed me that I still had emotion left in my broken soul. It’s the first time I’ve felt human in so long. 
If you’ve read up to here I really appreciate you listening to a stranger’s story because it’s kind of like I get to vent. I’m too embarrassed to vent to anyone I know because I don’t like to talk about my gender dysphoria. 
So thank you."
Nishthegreat,2021-09-24 10:32:13+00:00,(M 21) Feeling sad all the time.,"The past few days, I have been sleeping a lot casually. I won't be saying that I am DEPRESSED, it's a very big term in itself however I do have random outbursts and I cry. My life isn't helping me either. I have been preparing for competitive exams since the past 3 months now and have isolated myself. It's only twice or thrice a month I step outside my house and meet my friends.  My relationship too is not helping, she (F 20) has been very busy with her Uni and gets only 3-4 hours off in which she manages her sleep.

I have been unable to focus, I can't study and I feel sad all the time. I think I know what's wrong but can't seem to fix it. Recently, I binged Netflix for 7 hours straight, which is very uncommon of me. I rarely watch anything but this is exactly when I think everything went downhill. I did some research and found out that this generally happens after binge watching but now it's been 1 week and I still feel the same, hopeless and lost. 

This is not where I wanted to be in my life, I have suddenly started questioning my relationship. I don't even know anymore if what I am studying for is actually what I want, I feel like throwing away all the work I have put in the last 3 months. I am questioning my own existence, what's the purpose that I am doing what I have been doing, where will it lead me and what do I actually want. Of course, I want to be rich and wealthy but what after? I wait for the day to end so I can sleep. Every night before closing my eyes I hope I feel better tomorrow but it's not working. I am just lost at this point, I tried going out and talking to friends but that's only a temporary fix. I feel as if my life is done, I am 21, living with my parents and haven't done anything significant yet. I can't ever feel again the excitement of new love, I can't reverse the time, I can't be where I wanted to be."

I have this feeling that nobody really likes me, I have nobody to really talk to when I really can't life anymore, and I have to endure everything just for myself. Sometimes I even have the impression that my own friends don't even remember that I exist anymore. But I need someone. Almost every night when I'm alone in my bed I cry for hours, unable to sleep, and keeping all this for myself procure an unbearable pain.

In fact, I just hate life. I hate who I am, I hate how am I, I hate what I do, what I did in the past, I hate how everyone is with me, but my reactions are so stupid. I'm now in an art school, and I feel so incompetent next to all the other students in my class, even if they all are really kind and funny. Forcing me to smile in front of everyone everyday while I just want to die is so tiring.

Even the things that I love began to bored me years ago, when my depression started. I can't find the motivation to do anything even when I really should. My favorite games, books, now leave me without emotions, just trying to entertain myself to flee this life that I hate so much.

All that I want is staying in my bed all day waiting for the time to pass, but I know this isn't a true life. But I can't even find something to do with my existence. I'm good at nothing, there is nothing that I really like, and i'm so afraid of my future. I really don't know what to do.

I know I shouldn't complain, because I have a lot of things, that a lot of people dream of having, and my sadness is just pointless, and I really don't know what I should do.

This post is a huge summary, because I don't even know how I could explain the majority of my feelings.

Thank you for reading all this shit and sorry to bother you with all this.

Even if this is a selfish demand, could you guys tell me kind things, even if you don't know me, even if this is lies, please ? Maybe it could help me feel a little bit better, I don't know.

Thank you once again.

Does anyone else feel a sort of connection to the moon? Like.. I'm definitely a night person. Mostly because of how quiet and still everything is. And since I neither have a job or any friends I spend most of my awake hours in the night. Aaand I'm a chainsmoker, so a big portion of my time is spent on just staring up towards the stars and the moon.
And I love the stars, personally I think they're one of the most naturally beautiful things on earth.
But the moon is something else for me. Hard to explain. But when it's visible it's so reassuring, so comforting. It's like the sun, but not really. The sun is something you always notice but can't really have a look at.
And the moon is something that's also bright and glowing, but you can also look at it.
What I'm saying is that the moon has always been there, in my awake hours, looking down on me, shining on me, in it's own way? Weird thing to explain. But yeah, it's comforting."

Amazing-Most-1085,2021-09-23 08:01:38+00:00,I want to believe that this is all happening for a reason.,"I'm broken. I have a million things wrong with me. I push everyone away from me because I can't for the life of me, form a genuine meaningful relationship. My therapist just said she can't help me. I haven't been happy since I was 7, but I wouldn't want it to be any other way..... This is the only life I know.

I've been having a really hard time lately dealing with my stress. Ngl it's gotten to the point where I've thrown up a couple times, it's been hard to fall asleep, usually I pass out around 3am and then wake up at 8am. 

I can't lose this streak though I need to stay on my grind. For once I feel like I can do anything, I've never felt this way, it's terrifying. For the first time tonight I felt something I've never felt, or at least not for a while, but I think it was happiness. It was only for 30 seconds because I got a panic attack instantly 😂. New emotion unlocked? 

I have a dream now, with weekly goals I set for myself, it's keeping me going. I have people I don't even know supporting me and hating on me. I've been called a ""glorified thief"" and I kind of am, but this has to be my path, right? 

I'm not gonna lie, I kind of lost myself a few years ago and haven't really seen that person since. I used to want to change the world and help people. I'm fully dedicated to my career now though and focused only on me. It may be selfish, but we can't change the world if we can't change ourselves.

I'm taking a break from it all this week though, even though I'm still sort of working. It's my dream, but it's also sort of tearing me apart. It's okay to take a break, it's something we all have to do. Just to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

I've been trying to move too fast, but what happens when you do that is that you'll eventually lose control and crash. Ease off the gas pedal, small movement is still movement. If there's anything I've learned from the last couple years it's that small progress adds up. 

I just want to believe this is all happening for a reason, idk how, but every time shit gets hard it always ends up working out. Maybe I just adapt to the situation, but still, it works. 

Idk if this makes sense, but yeah... You're doing great! 👍

Good morning ☀️ it's 4am now."

zeron6789,2021-09-23 04:53:59+00:00,I Just want to be loved,"I have tried so hard to love myself and can't due to my trauma from a child. i can't even feel emotions most of the time other than suicidal ideation and i try so hard to fight and to feel and i just can't. but I've been with so many women, and I'm not perfect and have grown so much. I've been married and divorced due to being cheated on, or as she put it, (my mental health and I'm just always sad and suicidal, or i can't love myself so no one will ever be able to love me) . I've recently tried to date again after a year or so of the divorce and was just used because I'm trying to be kind and to be better and just be nice. i just wish someone would just want to come home to me. not make me feel like I'm a burden on this planet. i know people say it'll happen. or just stop searching and it'll come. it'll be there, but i genuinely don't know what it feels like to be loved. abusive parents, any friends have died, and just. i want to be loved. i want to feel loved. the closest i felt was on a ton of shrooms and trying to feel anything and i felt love from what i thought was mother earth, Gaia. but i haven't since then and ran out of shrooms. i just, i want someone to want to be around me, or look at me the way i look at people. i want someone to have a hard day at work (not the hard day part) but to want to just look forward to coming home to me and want to just have me take care of them. i want someone to want to go to a bar and not want to flirt with other people, just flirt with me even if we have been together for years. i want someone to show me off to their friends and on social media, i try so hard to just be me and be healthy and happy, and i go out of my way so much to make sure others are better and happy, and i let people use me just for the chance maybe someone will stick around or keep me around and I'm so desperate to just have someone hold me and tell me I'm worth being loved. it hurts so much when I'm reminded constantly that I'm not. or told by ex's that I'm psychotic because i just want to be around someone all day especially if i enjoy their company. i know i displace it in people but i just want someone to feel that way about me, be clingy, be jealous, just genuinely want me for who i am. i just.. I'm surrounded by friends, and people who are trying so hard to show me that I'm not alone but I've never felt more isolated because i just... i want someone to call my own and i can share these thoughts, or the dark side of my brain and they just hold me and say i love you for who you are and i know they mean it and just aren't using me for a place to stay, or for sex, or money, or because i put them first. i just. why can't i be loved? just. i try so very hard to tell myself i deserve it too, and i want to be just this kind hearted person because i use to be just so angry all the time and i grow tired of people pushing me to be this bad guy and then villainize me when i snap after weeks of mistreatment when all i do is give out love and kindness. i just.. I'm drunk, and just need someone to hold me and let me cry. and i can't even be open with the people around me because my brain refuses to let me be vulnerable because it calls myself a burden or i don't want to make them feel bad, or just i don't know. just.. needed to put words behind it and sorry for being a burden to everyone who has known me. i try and i try but what's the point of it all?. .I'm just pathetic and sad all the time and I'm tired. so so tired of living. if reincarnation exists after I'm gone I'm going to be pissed. just. i wish someone would come along and show me that everything I've been through was for something. me living this long was worth it. but if my own mother couldn't love me, then why should anyone else."

Hopey-Dreamer,2021-09-23 04:07:21+00:00,"I’ve been fearing death all my life but I’m also having thoughts about what if death would be a quick escape (not by killing myself, but no longer protesting against any physical illnesses since it would be no big deal if they killed me)","I have a relationship where it’s likely I’m being just used by a man I have strong feelings for and who is a massive part of my life and that relationship might be tumbling, I have a totally non supportive family who constantly say I’m a big burden and refuse to listen to any of my problems and definitely don’t want to help me with anything. They are even saying that it’s likely my boyfriend will dump me shortly as no one wants to be with a problematic, burdensome person. I have this fear in my head that he’s cheating on me already...I retorted that yeah, well what if it looks like he’s just taking advantage of me with sex? Then my mom’s  like do you think that’s all he needs? I’m totally shocked by these comments and they are just perpetuating my sorrow and fear that he will leave me because I can’t be like a proper girlfriend that he’s happy with and I will lose a great man through my own subconscious fault. I have been struggling with my uni studies and have even failed one subject last semester. I don’t know if I have any motivation for any specific career aspiration, no clear goals. I have been locked up with my non supportive family 24/7 for months now due to Covid lockdowns. I have an ongoing mysterious medical condition for three weeks now, (constant urge to urinate) tests have so far shown nothing and I’m at a crossroads. Been trying to save myself because I’ve always been utterly petrified of ceasing to exist and have been trying to get any med possible and go to every doctor in order to be well again physically but now I’m tired. I’m tired of being used by everyone and supported and genuinely loved by no one. Of suffering from symptoms I can’t get to the bottom of and about which no one cares anyway. I receive no emotional help. I really am a burden so I’ve asked god for whatever he plans to make it quick, whether it’s heal me or kill me."

MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-23 02:13:41+00:00,"I feel pathetic, but I wish I had someone to hold and who could hold me back","Normally I don’t mind the loneliness, I know that I choose to be away from people because they’re not worth the trouble to me. Because all my past experiences have gone to hell and I’d rather spend the rest of my life completely alone then ever have to deal with any of that shit ever again. At least I’m used to dealing with loneliness, and besides, most people only make me feel more alone. But this is one aspect of loneliness that rears up every so often and it’s like a kick to the chest.

I’ve never had a girlfriend. Only ever been in love once, with my best friend at the time but that whole situation was fucked because she didn’t feel the same way and it basically killed the only real friendship I’ve ever had. So I don’t allow myself to feel that shit anymore. But I feel so touch-starved. When I do those love language tests I always get physical touch, but I also don’t allow people to touch me (not that anyone ever really tries), I feel weirded out by it somehow and I reel back, hugs and stuff make me uncomfortable. It’s like I’m so touched starved, but I also can’t handle being touched.

I’ve tried having a casual sex every now and then but it feels like that makes everything way worse. I just feel numb to everything I guess, I can barely feel the touching and it only makes me feel more alone. I’m so numb at this point I can’t even orgasm during sex, I’ve literally never been able to. That only adds to the feeling that I’m just broken and alone. That I’m supposed to be alone because all the evidence points to the fact that even though I think I want closeness, it’s not something I can ever have.

Mainly this thought gets me while I’m in bed at night though. I can’t even describe how much I want someone next me. Someone to keep my bed warm. Someone who I can hold in my arms and who I can feel them hold me back. I feel like I don’t have to guess where I stand when I’m in someone’s arms, for a brief moment I can just trust that they love me. And I can hold them back, knowing they’re not going anywhere, that at least in that moment, they’re with me. I want some who can lay with me and sleepily whisper “good night” and “I love you” and all those tiny things I don’t ever get to hear. Someone who’s subtle breath I can listen to to lull me to sleep. Someone who I can wake up with and want to spend the day with, not that awkward feeling of subtle regret where you’re trying to figure out the least insulting way to get them to leave the morning after.

I feel so pathetic, but I want it so bad that I hold onto a pillow every night, like it’s a pretty girl who loves me. Sometimes I squeeze it so tightly, just willing it to be a person. Other times I spend hours listening to audio clips on YouTube of people doing girlfriend role plays while I gently stroke the surface of the pillow, imagining it’s her back or her arm or down her side. Not that I had any money anyway, but I wish you could pay someone for this, to just lay in bed with you every night, so that you can just have someone to hold onto, feel someone in your arms. I wouldn’t even care if they were always gone when I woke up, just for that brief window, I could feel connected to someone."
Chrishanson77,2021-09-23 02:03:21+00:00,"am i depressed, or could it be something else?","in recent times, ive been going through many symptoms in which i cant explain. im finding it really hard to concentrate, and im notably wright slower and slower on paper. i sometimes even mix up my words or misspell then alot. on top of all of this, i found it a bit of a challenge to get up in the mornings and stay awake during my the mornings. i come to school tired each day, despite having 8+ hrs of sleep, and im not able to preform at my highest capabilities. i use to do great, but now i find it a challenge to wright down notes and keep up with my home work. after the day has nearly come to its end, i would get headaches, sometimes severe in some cases. i have been feeling depressed lately, and my family does have a history of depression. but honestly, this doesn’t really seem like depression to me, could it he something more?"
defrostingsalad,2021-09-23 00:17:20+00:00,I wish I'd be more depressed/ rant,"I used to be really depressed like 3 years ago, and now my life is not necessarily better but I guess it's not as worse and I dont feel as depressed as I used to (I do have sad episodes tho but I guess that happens to everyone) I barely feel it actually, and I hate it. 

I want to get better because I know I need to, and at the same time I want to go back to feeling all that pain I used to have, because it made me feel valid.

During that period I didn't really have a lot of access to social media thanks to my dad. And had no irl friends so I felt extremely alone in my pain. No one to relate to or talk to. My parents apparently cared but not enough to make me feel like my feelings were valid.

Anyways, now that I can be on social media way more, I can see all these people talking about how depressed they are and it's almost like I'm jealous because I dont feel it anymore. Like, now it's too late. Yeah the way the world works still makes me feel like shit but it's just not the same? I dont know... it's stupid. 

And I KNOW depression is not cool or fun, of course I'm aware, but somehow I still want it back. It gave me a reason to be lazy, to not gaf about my life.

I feel like my depression was never valid in the first place anyway. People have it so much worse than me, like so much fucking worse 14yo me couldn't even imagine, and here I was acting like a spoiled kid.

I hate myself. I suppose THAT will never go away. I feel like I'm always seeking attention even when I try hard not to.

i'm so weird. I hate everything I do. The way I act seems so fucked up. Why am I like this.

 I've seen a few therapists but I can never bring myself to talk about the entire situation I'm in. I'm just so ashamed of my own person and sometimes I dont even know why.

Everything is just a big confusion, ""adolescence"" they'll say. Yeah, well I'm considered an adult now, so I guess not. But even before hitting the teenage years, I always felt ashamed of myself in a way. So I don't think that's entirely related.

I wish I could just go back in time and rewatch every single thing that happened for me to turn out this way. It's not like I was heavily abused and neglected. Nothing traumatizing happened to me when I was little... so why do I feel so fucked up.

Maybe I was just born a terrible human being."

xvadax,2021-09-22 23:07:40+00:00,I reject the idea of being a female. I don't know what is wrong with me.,"**TMI AND TRIGGER WARNINGS! (I am new to using reddit, please bear with me. IDK if this is the right place to post either)**

I'll try to explain the best I can, but I am honestly confused by my own mind. I don't understand why I am like this, or if it's just my mental illness playing tricks on me. 

For as long as I can remember, maybe aged 8 or so, I have rejected a lot of things that girls are supposed to like or be like. I am now almost 22 and it's just getting worse.

It started off with small things like hating cats, dresses, the colour pink and claiming to be a tomboy. I would even got irritated when others were more tomboyish than me, like I had to prove something. 

At the same time I always loved Bratz and Barbies, but I also loved boys toys, and was never allowed to get them. As I've gotten older, things have escalated... 

I refuse to wear woman's clothing. I feel uncomfortable in anything remotely feminine, floral or cut, doesn't matter, I will not wear it. I do enjoy feminine clothes, just not on myself.  I don't wear make up, jewellery, or anything of the sort. 

My own mother continuously calls me a lesbian. I am not. She never allowed me to buy boys clothes until I got old enough to buy my own, now she just calls me gay, and says no man will ever want me. 

I refuse the idea of becoming pregnant and having to take birth control. I feel disgusted in my own period, not that blood disgust me, just the idea that I have a reproductive system inside of me. I refuse to have any invasive test such as pap smears. I'm a virgin, for these reasons. I do want to have sex one day but I can't even begin to imagine be forced to take birth control, or becoming pregnant. 

I feel powerless as a female. I know women are strong, but I feel as if I am not. I daydream about being a male, even though I'm fine being a female for the most part, I don't care to change my gender, but I feel as if I would 100% pick being a male. 

I hate the fact women are seen as old and useless by 30. I hate that I'm being pressured into getting married and having children. The idea of pregnancy petrifies me to no end, but society tells females if they don't have children, they're useless. I personally don't believe this, yet here I am, worrying about it. I do want children one day, but not by me giving birth. 

It's so weird to me. I love the colour pink now. I love Bratz and Barbies. I hate dressing feminine and make up. I hate my own reproductive organs. 

I feel a tremendous amount of pressure on me, like a unbelievable amount. The future scares me. The fact I am a virgin scares me. I feel like if I wait to long, it will be a red flag. Maybe I already am one. I just want to live in a fantasy world, but earth isn't one of them. 

I hope I haven't offended anyone... this is just how I feel. I need advice."

I am losing hope that I'll ever be happy.


I used to get meds against my depression and anxiety, different types, different dosages... but nothing really helped.
I either felt just as bad, or I felt empty. No sadness - no happiness, just... plain nothing. 

I didn't want to take them anymore, and quited them several years ago and I was doing kinda rough in the first few months, but after that I was doing pretty okay. 


Now my life's pretty good actually, I have a full time job, a girlfriend - a flat and pets together

I’m not Hercules, David, or Achilles and this isn’t some grand battle to win. Nor is it some beast terrorizing the townspeople. It’s a sickness, a cancer, with no treatment or cure. It’s a sharp blade that implants itself in your head, leaving you immobile. It’s a creature that jumps on your back and drags you down to the ground until you’re captured. I’m tired and there’s no way I can defeat this black emptiness. Better men than me have tried and been crumpled in half by it. World leaders, famous actors, and billionaires have all been taken before by this emptiness. I am no one and have nothing compared to them. I guess today another man will fall victim to the clutches of misery, to the deepest depths of despair. The end."
Awkward-Yard6121,2021-09-22 18:19:30+00:00,How can I help my depressed friend?,"So, I have been struggling with depression and social anxiety myself. 

Recently I finally managed to make friends with very kind people. Even though they don't know anything about my struggles they've helped me a lot in getting my anxiety under control since they tried to get me to be more social. (I was basically the weird kid)

They even introduced me to some of their other friends which helped me gain more confidence. I've begun talking to some old friends again whom I didn't have the energy to spend time with in a long time.

I'm feeling happier again even if it's just a tiny bit.

But then, there's that one friend of mine who also has depression.

And to be honest I'm starting to consider ending our friendship.

Now, I have to say, they are, or at least used to be the most important person in my live. 

They were the one person I could tell anything and they could tell me anything. I love them dearly and want to help them but there's a problem.

Whenever I'm around them I feel so much worse. They are a huge trigger to me. 

It's nothing they say, nothing they do but still, I can't stand being around them anymore. 

They remind me of all the things I thought and did when I was at my lowest point and I don't want to remember all that.

There's just all these thoughts that come back whenever I'm around them, I don't ever want to have again.

I've been trying to help them. I've tried to socialize them a bit more by introducing them to my friends and asking them to spend time with us but they don't want to. 

We are still students and go into different classes so we've been spending less time together, also they rarely want to go out anymore, so I can't look out for them as much as I want to.

And they seem to be getting worse.

They are a wreck, they don't smile anymore, they don't talk much anymore, they're always exhausted and I've tried so hard to help them but everything is useless.

They've also been avoiding me. I don't want our friendship to end because they used to be the first person I ever felt so safe around but now it's just not like that anymore. 

I don't want to leave them behind but I feel like if things continue like this I will never be able to get better myself."

She got into legal trouble and was very depressed. I got back together with her and we dated for about 2 more months until she had sex with a guy in a coffee shop. I was destroyed because she promised she would always be loyal. I never felt what I felt that night. I was shaking like I was freezing and my teeth clattering. I forgave her but our relationship couldn't work after a week because I was in too much pain because of her. We continued to be friends. I helped her out with all of her troubles and we watched shows together. Until I found out she was in a serious relationship with the guy she originally cheated on me with. She was fucking him. I was just starting to recover from everything but this got me. I can't take the pain. I feel like i'm sick. I'm alone and I have no friends. I just blocked her on all my social media platforms.

It's like she passed her obligations to me when I haven't even learned a single thing from her. she even gets half of my (really really small) allowance I get from someone. i just can't take the fact that she's able to buy stuff for her new baby but cant even buy us (more) decent food. i'm so tired of ceying over the same shit again and again. it's just too heavy and i dont know what to do. i want to provide my little brothers good stuff but i don't even know where to start. i was thinking of doing art commisions but i dont even have materials :( everything is so heavy right now. i just feel like giving up sometimes. what do i do? :( how do me nd my little brothers get by :("
high-chew,2021-09-22 10:20:46+00:00,i made my decision,"i can’t do it anymore, all i do is cause heartache to people i care about. i distanced myself from all my friends and i don’t think they consider myself a friend anymore. my family looks at me as a burden and waste of space. i caused a lot of pain to my ex when i left him for my current bf. i’m a huge disappointment to myself, i’m nowhere i want to be and i just can’t stand looking at myself anymore.
my boyfriend and i talked about going on a break to focus on ourselves (i wanted my mental health to get better, dont want to burden him with my emotions and hurt him in my healing process) we are going on a picnic tomorrow and after that our break starts. i don’t see myself getting better, i think about dying every single second of the day, even when i’m experiencing happy moments. i made a plan, wrote goodbye letters, and i think next week would be a good time. tried to make it to halloween but i’m not strong enough for that.
it hurts to know i’ll cause one last heartache to everyone but i know they’ll get over it &amp; be fine. the world will keep on turning and i think everyone would be better off without me."

Ok-Ice-7990,2021-09-22 05:35:15+00:00,A note,"This is boring asf so I don't suggest reading it but ye.
I titled this ""A note"" because I'm still unsure what this is, I tried to write this on a piece of paper but my shit handwriting made me think otherwise, I'm 16. I first off apologize if this is all over the place. I think telling people your problems is cringy and stupid yet here I am knowing I'm gonna get the ""stay strong"", ""you're still young"" or ""you're not alone"" shit because I heard it from people around me. Let's start with my story I suppose I have nothing to hide especially from people on the internet even if only one person sees this but I want to type it out because i just want to know that someone somewhere knows what I'm going through regardless if it feels like nothing and absolutely silly to me, childish even. There's so much that I can't talk about because I don't have the patience to write this out because I'll overthink it, my mom was a violent alcoholic and my dad was never home because he was always working to keep a roof over our head so being 4 years old with a lady screaming at you isn't so fun, then I contracted pseudomonas in my ear around the same age losing 85% of hearing in my left ear and 15% in my right and ended up spending 8 months in the hospital, went back home same shit abusive dad and alcoholic mom, hated going to school but still went until high-school grade 7 here in Canada, I skipped a lot of school, doing this from 7-10 and ending failing grade 10 to where I'm at now adult education attended two solid weeks then started skipping again but let's get back to when I got out of the hospital maybe a year later youth protection got involved for a variety of reason regarding my parents and going to school smelling like cat piss because our family was so poor. Skip forward couple a years my dad finally left my mom and I choose to go with him but my 3 brothers stayed, 2 with autism. Mind you I am the youngest. 9 years of age at that point, at 11 I got involved with my cousins smoking weed, drinking alcohol, stealing etc... long story short I got molested, yep. only people that know that are my former gf and you guys so that's nice ig, continue to move forward rest of elementary was a breeze regardless of still being dirt poor getting beat or whatever else happend, so grade 7. August my nephew died at 10 days old, half sister had to have a c section but the doctors accidentally cut the placenta and the baby ended up swallowing some of the contents and died attended the funeral, cried, oh well that's life.
Grade 9 grandfather died while my dad was in the hospital almost dead with esophagus cancer. My dad was in the same hospital with him and and I would visit my dad everyday but I wouldn't visit my grandfather because him and me got into a fight over the fact that I was doing stupid shit that I don't wish to go into depth with. So I stopped visiting him 3 months prior to him being in the hospital, then when he was in the hospital I didn't visit him either because I didn't think he was gonna die, we were really fucking close. Grade 10 made a suicide joke that wasn't a joke but I played it off as a joke to my social worker, very stupid in hindsight. I got placed in a group home for the 4th time like I said I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out so ye. but I played it off as a joke and they let me out and now my grandmother is in the hospital. She's practically dead that's what the doctors said but oh well, I feel like I've seen it all, been through it all and so this is the highlights, that's not including my anxiety, my constant stress of school, cutting people out of my life , left and right so I'm all alone and many many many other things that I did not include but ye a note of my not so terrible life. Cant help someone who wont help them self"

Polymath360,2021-09-21 21:05:27+00:00,Giving Myself Until Halloween,"As an Asian American, my parents basically raised me to become an ATM machine. I never had a normal childhood because all I could think of while growing up is escaping poverty. Today, they found out that I was laid off and they were livid.

I'm giving myself until the end of October to hear back from the dozens of companies I applied to. After that, I deserve a break from this nightmare. I'm so done.

I graduated college at the top of my class, did many internships as a student, and have 3 years of paid work experience. I played sports in high school and had straight A's. I did all this while being autistic and I'm completely burnt out playing the job interview and waiting game. Not once have I heard ""I'm proud of you.""

When I was a freshman in college, I took out a life insurance policy just in case. If I don't any job offers by then, I'm going to take the permanent rest option. I'm so sick of this.

I'm willing to take a janitor position at this point. I just don't want to have to move back to California and face my abusive parents.

My last meal would be salmon roe, wagyu ribeye, croissants, lobster, and bone marrow. One last hurrah if things don't get better."

I just keep sitting. I feel like crying always. There is no point of me living. Me doing any activity. Nothing is making me happy. I do not have anybody who can listen to me and tell its ok things will be fine. I wanted to talk to somebody pinged them, told them I am sad. I got ok as response. Why nobody wants to know what other person is suffering from. Why do we have to only show our happy faces and tell that yes I am doing good. Why nobody wants to know if there is anything bad going on others life. Is it that boring to listen to others pain.

Beforehand, during high school, I was looking forward to partying, going to nightclubs, having the time of my life. Of course I was also planning my pathway to my career and getting a job. But I also couldn’t wait to go to nightclubs and party. I’m an extrovert. But the pandemic took that away from me. I’m never going to live that 20s life I desired. All I do now is work and study, every single day. I live with constant existential dread and it doesn’t help that I already struggle with so many personal issues. But this constant loop of work and study has me so dead inside. I feel like I’ve already aged so much. I’ve lost so much empathy, I no longer dream of bigger things, I keep thinking about work and death. Maybe if I was an introvert, this would be better. But I’m a huge extrovert. I nearly killed myself last year when quarantine was at its peak. Now I feel numb, too lazy and anxious to attempt suicide. I feel like a robot."

throwaway_hg49,2021-09-21 03:58:48+00:00,I think I screwed up my relationship,"Okay…

Right now, I am going through an episode of significant depression and a touch of apathy that is manifesting in household irresponsibility - largely with housework and my fiancé reached her snapping point with it. She’s distanced herself from me - detaching herself and mostly keeping separate from me - I work night shifts, so I don’t see much of her anyway and she’s a night owl, so she’s had me sleeping on the couch in the living room the past few days. She describes it as “setting boundaries” and has been transparent about her anger with my lack of consistency with chores.

I need to work on having empathy in her regard, apparently my lack of attentiveness to house chores is ignited PTSD-related memories about her dad in her childhood. The most fundamental element to her reasoning is that my depression has gotten catastrophic - with which I can agree - I might be an asshole for this, but I feel her anger has gotten the better of her as she claims I prioritize “work over family/household” because of neglecting house chores. The reason I find this a bit extreme is because I DO do things to help contribute to the house - I make dinner, I drive her places when she doesn’t feel up to driving, I have to fight my social anxiety to do most of the shopping for the house, and then I always try to be emotionally supportive by listening without judgement - it almost feels thankless.

The peak of the dilemma came to be when my fiancé told me that she has contemplated self-harm in a manner evocative to her dad’s mistreatment of her; I was desperate to get her out of her emotionally abusive household so she could feel safe - lack of safety is never something I want to feel in a relationship - but this very danger appears to have followed her in the form of me. I recognize that I acted selfishly and with apathy by letting my depression and lack of executive functioning (as a neurodivergent person) get the better of me, but I feel conflicted as I never would make any deliberate attempts to emotionally harm my fiancé herself as I care for her. I feel as if she expects me to grow up from my childishness within a short time (which is more of a misinterpretation on my part most likely) and simply overcome my neuroticism, but I might have to make an ultimate decision if I still pose a danger to her.

Thank you."
tangiblederiv,2021-09-21 03:45:27+00:00,"Even a lousy 9-5 would be better than this shit. Anything. I just want to sleep; really, it would set me fucking free. Give me a pillow and a damn break.","

I’m pursuing a pretty rigorous degree: physics. I suppose a part of me believed it’d steer me far from a 9-5’s grueling grip; at the time, it was the most awful outcome I could imagine — a cage, really, and one I’d rot in. 

I’m miserable. I don’t say this lightly. When I say misery I mean it in its fullest, most potent form: I am miserable. Completely, entirely miserable.

Sleep tyrannizes the front-burner of my mind. I have no passions, no will. For the first time in my life, I’m hopeless. 

Periodically, a thought wedged way far back in the depths of my mind surges to the surface: I should quit it at all and pursue a smooth-sailing degree. Better yet, drop out altogether. I’m miserable no matter what circumstance I squeeze myself into. 

I’ve been surviving off the hope that there is, there MUST be, something out there for me: but it’s idealistic and the truth is I can’t be content in this mind, or at least, my contemporary mind. 

Oftentimes I feel as though I have some sort of severe serotonin disorder. Something. I can’t imagine how I’m this horribly sad, given the objectively forward path my life is heading along.

I hate this. I hate this all. I’m bitter and depressed and alone. I’m tired. I want to sleep. I don’t want to do anything, and each day demands more than I can fit on my plate. I’m exhausted. 

Fuck this, fuck it all, I just want to quit."

She comes around when dropping the kids off and it just pulls at my heart more and more each time.. a vicious cycle. I still try to show i have feelings, this past weekend i went over and helped set up my daughter's birthday and mowed the grass like she asked so i could set up decorations. It was like she wanted me to be there an not just for the kids but maybe it was. Deep down something tells me that she still loves me , i want to believe that. Actions do speak louder than words though and she doesnt seem to try and meet me half way. Am i mistaking her kidness for what i truly want it to be? Shes not always kind, mm ost of the time back and forth. One minute i do t exist and the next she really acts like she might care. I dont know how much longer i can live feeling like this. Not that i want to die just be able to move on and not want it back so bad. It consumes me and controls every part of my being. How does so someone have so much power over another?

 I'm depressed. Been this way from a history of trauma, loss, grief, and alcohol/substance abuse. I'm still here. I'll be 100% sober during my knee recovery. Not even pain meds. I know my past.

 One of the few healthy things I enjoy is riding my bike. I had 2 knee inuries. One in 2019 and one this past July. I haven't been able to ride since my last injury. Now I need surgery. 

But do I even want life anymore? Even before this I questioned that. I'm honestly going through surgery in the hopes that maybe I'm one of those rare people who dies from anethesia or gets a blood clot or something.

I just want to die unintentionally. 

If I had a birthday wish or a magic genie. That's it. Take me out.

What should I do? They also bust into my room. Its not like I'm doing drugs... Even on my discord I only talk to my classmates (im 15). I don't see anything on my Google. Mostly DanTDM, Dream and TommyInnit sometimes. Before I had a device, I used to watch on the Android TV. Any shows/videos with even a word such as 'hell' is strong enough for a ban from the show/youtuber... So I couldn't watch TommyInnit... If you're a parent seeing this, please know that there is a hefty line between taking care and invading privacy. If you think that your child is watching shows with words such as F\*\*\* it is bad, but something like Hell is not.

hgilbert_01,2021-09-20 07:45:23+00:00,I feel like such a child…,"The more my fiancé and I live autonomously in our own house, the more pressingly obvious it becomes that I am behind in terms of maturation into an adult. My fiancé is getting increasingly frustrated with my irresponsibility; I have not been consistent with house chores or have been on top of financial matters. I’m also horribly fragile emotionally - my fiancé wants me to try and get in touch with her dad, but his temper issues and generally abrasive mannerism makes me feel claustrophobic and scared.

For context, I know for certain that I am neurodivergent - it’s just a frustratingly ambiguous gray area about whether its autism, ADHD, both, or none - mostly because of a cruddy medical history. I don’t know, there is something within my mind that makes it to where I can never really be a fully dependent, autonomous person. Whenever there is something that threatens my emotional insecurity (scares me, simply) then my option is to run away or freak out if I can’t and I feel I don’t have the mental capacity to maintain adult responsibilities.

My fiancé proclaims she is “putting up boundaries”, but for the past couple days, it’s sort of felt like that she has shut me out because of exhausted anger of having to “raise” me. She’s expressed this to her therapist who responded that these behaviors of mine may never go away (much to my fiancé’s dread); I have feeling that my fiancé’s therapists is onto something as I think my dependent nature is something that will be chronic. I’m afraid my next step will be communicating this to my fiancé and having to figure out what to do from there.

Thank you."

Throwaway_bae420,2021-09-20 04:07:00+00:00,Physical implications,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life and lately it hasn’t been a good time at all. Due to circumstances beyond my control I’ve been dealing with a lot of added stress and I think my body is finally breaking down on me. A lot of work related stuff but at least I can escape work, now life is just going downhill and filled with existential dread.

My father in law is dying and it’s really hard on everybody, including me. Apparently he was in the 5% of people that would most likely die from the new covid variant. We’re pretty sure my boyfriend and his stepmom caught it at the beginning of the pandemic so it’s shocking to see how much it’s killing him now.

My boyfriend doesn’t want sympathy or to talk about it that much even though I’m really messed up over it and I know he has to be feeling way worse than me and just doesn’t want to show it. And to make things worse we think his stepmom started doing hard drugs again, and one of my father in law’s best friends just died suddenly yesterday because he touched a live power line at his job.

My bf has 3 little brothers and I’m scared for everyone right now. Idk what’s going to happen and its really making me question my life’s purpose. I feel empty and terrible and I think all this stress and feeling suicidal over feeling like I have no purpose is taking a toll on me physically. 

I’ve been eating and sleeping as normal but occasionally I’ll experience vertigo out of nowhere. I’ve also been having migraines so bad that I won’t be able to look outside and sometimes my vision will get all spotty. 

I almost blacked out at work the other night just by picking my head up too fast which was kinda my first red flag that something wasn’t right. 

I’ll occasionally get confused or distracted and forget what I was doing. For example when I was making dinner the other night I started pouring scallops into a strainer that I wasn’t holding over anything and kept pouring for a few seconds before realizing I was getting fish water all over my floor.

I think I’ve just been so upset lately that it’s making me sick. For those wondering I’m 90% sure it’s not covid related, I can still smell, taste, and breathe fine. And I don’t feel that weak until I get the vertigo which isn’t all the time. I’m definitely going to see a doctor regardless."
JollySucculents,2021-09-20 03:00:27+00:00,I can’t stop thinking about him,"It makes me feel so stupid. I can’t stop thinking about him no matter what. All day I think about him, I get drunk so I don’t have to, but that’s all I do when I drink. I can’t get him out of my mind. 

It makes me feel so stupid for falling in love with him when I now realize I was nothing more to him than a rebound. Just when I think I’m starting to get over him I see him around on campus, at Walmart, or see something that reminds me of him and it’s like I’m set back to right when he broke up with me. It’s now been longer that we’ve been apart than we were together and that makes me feel even more stupid and bad about myself. I’ve tried so hard to get over him and casually date around and all that, but I just end up thinking about him before I go to bed. 

I feel so stupid and that my feelings aren’t valid, but when you go from having someone to talk to everyday and having someone to care about to suddenly being all alone and having that connection cut off, it’s lonely. I just don’t know how I’ll ever fall in love again when all I can do is think about him."
Sluttygirlthrowaw,2021-09-20 02:17:18+00:00,Depressed but better (trigger warning sexual abuse),"Some hope, I’m still depressed but better (trigger warning sexual abuse)

It’s been a tough few years, hell, it’s been a tough life. I was sexually abused by my mom growing up but it’s not the kind of thing you can mention to your extended family or most friends. It still affects me to this day with diagnosed PTSD and also physically… being sodomized can lead to long term fissures in your body that can be reopened really easily even as an adult. I was in a bad work situation, divorced, and fissure issues the last year. My health issues got so bad I almost passed away a few months ago (got bacterial infection from fissure). 

Last year I also got an amazing team of mental health care workers I let into my life after having really bad luck previously. They really gave me the strength and objective perspective to change my life away. I still get triggered sometimes and feel alone after cutting things off with most of my family (without them knowing why), but I am really grateful for this human beings that have helped me realize my past wasn’t inherently bad or good, but just gave me a unique perspective. It comes with its own challenges. Turns out some people in my extended family are still accepting even without knowing why I cut off contact which is really nice. 

 Some reason the last year it was really do or die… I was on the verge of suicide every day. I had never felt so disconnected and miserable. I guess through this desperation or really having nothing left to lose made me try extreme things. I got some extreme medical treatments that helped, but I was also more open to trusting other human beings about my situation which didn’t seem remotely possible before, I was so ashamed and blamed myself. I thought I was evil (my mom told me I was evil). It was really messed up. But I guess what I wanted to write is there are beautiful beautiful people out there that are willing to help people with such crazy lives. These people  often come from such expected beautiful places I’ve found. Sure there’s people that want to take advantage of openness, to use your pain against you and for their own gain, but these people who listen and share your pain are so much more important and inspiring to think about.

Anyway, I’m rambling, but thank you to the people who listen and help non judgmentally."

here’s some important information before i get on with this so that the advice that i get is relevant to me.  i’m 16 so a minor, and i remember being sexually assaulted when i was v v young but the person i told said it never happened, and i used to have a voice in my head that was so critical of me until i was like 14( haven’t heard that voice in a while  so i’m just hoping it’s gone), ive attempted suicide before, and ive been self harming since i was like twelve. 

so on with that now lol. i’m very suicidal and i’ve been feeling shitty for a whole long time now and it’s gotten to the point where i zone out and my only thoughts are about hurting myself , like for example i’ll zone out and i’ll get thoughts about stabbing my eye out with a pencil or stabbing my hand and stuff. i’m pretty sure that’s not normal, but when i told someone they said that it’s part of being a teenager, wanting to kill yourself is part of being a teenager and that i should just snap out of it. i want to go to a doctor but i’m starting to think that i’m just doing it for attention. like what if i go to the doctor and they say that i’m fine ( which honestly would be kinda nice) but then how do i get rid of all these bad feelings? or on the contrary what if they send me to a mental hospital? i can’t go to one bc i’ll get behind on school. yall i seriously need advice i think i’m gonna go crazy and j stab my eye one day lol"

I have these two very close people to my heart that I've been friends with for the last 4 years and I consider both my best friends, 2 years ago I found out that they've been in love ever since 2018, during the time of me finding out about them I started developing feelings for the girl, and these feelings grew stronger and stronger as time went by.
And really I don't think I need to explain any further how painful the position I'm in really is, every time I interact with either of them, I'm reminded that I can't have her and if I did I'd feel like a peice of shit because ik how much they love each other and Ik how they feel about one another, so I feel stuck in this cycle of mixed emotions of being constantly confused, obsessed, lonely, jealous, and ofc hating myself for feeling that way about her and I've been genuinely trying to get rid of those feelings for a long ass time now because I'd never forgive myself if I ever ruin there relationship and by extention, my friendship with them..

formath11,2021-09-20 01:08:59+00:00,Nothing ever goes my way,"I'm a 23 yo, never clinically diagnosed, pretty lost in my thoughts of whether I'm depressed or not, but yesterday I listed down everything that just happens to tick me off and put me down every day... I realized there's a lot.

1. Relationship - very one-sided, yet makes me happy, but ultimately feel trapped and unheard
2. Family - the pressure of being successful and anxiety of whether I'm making them proud or not
3. Job - stuck in a job I didn't see myself going... money is good, but my passion lies elsewhere in a career that has given me many opportunities, albeit with lower pay. 
4. Confidence - lowest I've ever been. Put on weight, trying to better my eating and fitness habits but keep slipping often.
5. Small things - daily allergies, feeling bloated, running my knee into my bedframe on accident
6. Character - I've become more straightforward, careless, ruthless, quiet. Started looking at the bigger picture and seeing no way out
7. Time - I'm 23. My day goes to work, my partner, my family, eating, then boom, to sleep. Rinse and repeat.
8. Death... - I've welcomed it at this point with the mindset ""if it happens, it happens, whatever."" I don't care about a lot of things anymore. I've put all my time and energy into other people thinking I'll get a positive return in this life, but it has not treated me that way. Suicidal thoughts? Definitely, but in seconds I circle back to ""no, not worth it.""

I can go on and on, this is an EXTREMELY brief summary of what makes me feel like this life has not been worth it lately. I feel controlled, stuck, no hope, no confidence, no guidance, no money for a therapist, no support system but my own self, nobody who truly listens to me and my problems. I lost all my friends focusing my time on my relationship and family and college/career, but now I regret so many things. I feel alone, worthless, hopeless.... I feel like there's not much left here.

&amp;#x200B;

I just needed to write this down and get this to a place where I hope someone will understand and listen... because people in my life now will never understand or try to listen to me."

2. I don’t connect with people irl. I have several friend groups I can sit with but I don’t feel included in any of them.

3. Idk who I am, who I wanna be, or what my purpose is anymore. I used to have this self-betterment phase but that just led to my downward spiral into depression and anxiety and my ED.

4. I recovered from my ED but now it’s slowly starting to creep back.

So… yeah. Things aren’t awful I guess. I have good grades, lots of friends, or at least people who I have good relationships with, and I live comfortably and go to a good school. Still…. I feel so empty."

litstikk,2021-09-19 19:57:43+00:00,Post Grad Depression is Very Real,"Graduated in April, depression started kicking in around July. 

I technically wasn’t supposed to graduate until December of this year, but I dropped one of double minors to graduate “on time” out of pressure from my family and financial reasons. Honestly, I didn’t mind it because at the time I was going through so much and the uncertainty of the virus…i just really wanted to go. 

Now, I’m working full time at a very toxic and demanding workplace. All while trying to study for the LSAT, which has made this very difficult. I also stay with my parents…and this I wouldn’t mind if my family wasn’t toxic themselves. I was under the impression that being away for 4 years would give them time to fix their issues but I guess not. 

It’s honestly like I can’t find any peace. Work is demanding, can’t go home and decompress from it because of family, and all of my friends are still in school themselves…so trying to maintain those relationships have been a struggle as well. 

I go back in forth between wanting my undergrad life back so much. I can’t cope with the idea that I had two choices: stay in school a little longer and make sure you are secure or go ahead and graduate and take the first job you are offered.  

Please tell me it gets better…haven’t felt this sad in so long."
nonlinearsynapses,2021-09-19 18:45:54+00:00,Another relapse,"I’m a 32M who has struggled with depression literally since I was a preteen. There are a multitude of factors that has caused this. From genetics, to family dynamics, early childhood trauma. It’s also precipitated a lot of other challenges i.e. substance abuse and dependency on alcohol, lost friendships and a failed marriage that ended in divorce, being forced to quit jobs or be fired due to attendance. 

I’ve tried to address it on multiple fronts: Been on antidepressants since I was 13, numerous different drugs tried, been seeing a therapist for almost 5 years, ketamine treatments, currently finishing TMS therapy. Nothing has really moved the needle all that much. 

During my split with my ex, I had to move back into my old room in my dad’s basement. While I’m thankful for the opportunity, I sit here and feel like a giant failure. This last week was awful. I only went to work 1 day. I’ve been sleeping nearly 12 hours everyday. My body feels like it’s completely given up. My mind is following suit. Suicidal ideation is an escape game I play with myself to ease the suffocating sense of disgust I feel with myself. I’ve done it since I was in elementary school. 

It feels like there are no answers. I’m trapped. I’m exhausted. I’m so tired. I don’t know when it will change. I don’t know if it can. My friends and family all mean well, but there isn’t anything they can do to help. I’m beginning to think there isn’t anything anyone can do to help. I feel like a failure without a chance for any other outcome. Not as long as I feel this much pain and weight. 

Most people don’t know how bad it is, because I put on a front to protect them. I don’t want them to worry about me. My dad has no idea I’ve missed that much work this week. I don’t want him to worry. I’ve tried to open up to him in the past, and he couldn’t handle it. It’s also second nature for me to hide myself around others. I’m too ashamed for them to see how I really am. 

Decades of struggling takes its toll. Each relapse feels worse than the last. This one especially."

MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-19 16:16:35+00:00,How viable is it to basically go off the grid?,"Viable in the sense of could you live your life that way, indefinitely and also viable in a financial sense, like would you basically need a huge amount of money or a substantial amount of some kinda passive income to achieve it?

I just can’t take it. I don’t want to be a part of society anymore. At least as much as I can avoid. I can’t hold down jobs because of my mental illnesses, I can’t go out and party and drink and have sex and friends and relationships like other people my age do because of how many conflicts it all puts in my head, I can’t stand constantly feeling trapped, like the walls are closing in around me by my financial situation, I just want to be free. Actually free. And the way I see it, the only way to actually be free in this world is to either be obscenely rich, which I’ll never be, or to just separate yourself from society. I’m just exhausted. I want to be alone.

But it also feels like society tries hard to trap you in, make it feel like it’s impossible to live if you’re not a part of it and you don’t conform. But I’m constantly suicidal, I know if I have to do this much longer… well, there won’t be a much longer. I don’t know if escaping will fix anything, maybe it’ll make me wanna die more, but it’s the one thing I’m telling myself I have to try before I’m allowed to die. So I’ve gotta try and find a way.

But I have no idea where to even start, I’m completely broke and jobless right now. I don’t have a car or even a license. I’m not too far off finally getting enough hours to get off my learner license, only taken me about 5 years so far. But it feels like it’s within my grasp for the first time ever. Don’t have it yet though, so it’s still a limiting factor, and even if I did have it, can’t afford a car. But basically I guess I’m looking for a list of things I need, a list of steps I can take or work towards taking somehow. Cause I can sit here all day and think of all the reasons it can’t be done, but if I keep that up I’m gonna give up on it before I even try and that’ll probably end with me giving up on life altogether.

Ideally, I guess I’d like to start with building my own house. Like with my own two hands. Don’t care if it’s little more than a lean-to, I just want to do it myself. Ive done a fair bit of woodworking before, and I’ve watched videos of people build log cabins and stuff and it doesn’t look totally outta the realm of something I think I could do. But I’d need tools and materials and stuff, I have none of that. That’s the type of thing that I guess keeps you bound to society in a way, cause I’m not sure how else you’d get that stuff other than buying it. I’d also kinda want power and hot water and stuff, which again, means inviting a bit of society back into your life, but it doesn’t seem too suffocating if I could keep it all at arms length. 

But I wouldn’t even know how to set any of that up, or what would be the smartest way to do it, if generators would make sense or if I’d have to connect to the mains still or what. And I also have no idea how to pay for fuel/electricity bills if I can’t work. And I can’t think of a way to do any of this long term without owning a least a small piece of land. But again, there’s a million reasons why I can’t, trying to focus on how I *can*. So has anyone done something like this? And if so, how’d you do it?"

One-Awareness9491,2021-09-19 12:19:51+00:00,The only person who ever cared about me and I fucked up,"This was 3 or 4 years ago but everytime I think about it I feel so depressed and sad on top of everything else in my life currently and not having anyone close. I can’t believe I screwed up with my ex, we were together almost 2 years and he was my bestfriend. I was a shy person but I’ve never felt more accepted and like myself than when I was with him. Made me feel so pretty n great (I looked so ass back then and now tbh) always gave me attention, wrote me cute notes, small gifts, I stayed at his house a whole summer basically just the two of us. I know it sounds really immature but I really believed he was the one. Maybe that’s how you feel with your first love and I know “if it didn’t work out it clearly wasn’t meant to be” I’m just, how could I have fucked things up with him. Now we are strangers, I don’t even know him anymore and he doesn’t even know me. I can never get that back. How can two people get so close and intimate and become complete background characters in each others lives. It hurts. I will never find anyone again, I can’t even make friends. I’m completely unattractive and have no personality and nobody talks to me unless it’s to fuck me and leave."

shyoregongirl94,2021-09-19 07:57:36+00:00,Feeling alone and socially awkward,"Since as far as I can remember, I have always been an introverted loner. Bull shit things that happened in middle school kind of put me off of making genuine friends after that, and it has stuck with me ever since. When I do make friends, it's usually by accident. And I have a hard time maintaining friendships because I've always known that they never last as much as I want them to. No relationship has lasted long and I've kind of gotten used to that. About the longest relationship I've had was 5 years and that was with someone who had betrayed me in the end.

I feel like I won't ever have a good connection with someone, like a best friend or a boyfriend. I'm too jaded and socially awkward to meet people in real life to do all of that. Most of the time I meet people online, and even then, I'm also bad at maintaining those relationships. I just suck in general when it comes to being a friend. 

I wish I wasn't so afraid of people sometimes. I wish I was actually myself with people and not a caricature of what I want to be. I don't recognize myself, I doubt my personality, of who I am, of the things I share with others. I hate being vulnerable around people, so I act like I'm not a meek person, that I'm totally chill and nothing bothers me. That I don't think I'm less than everyone, that I fucking suck, that I'm actually a really negative person who can't stop thinking of ending everything, burn the whole mundane life that I have and die.

My real self is a downer, tbh, and nobody normal likes that. At least I know how to psych myself up and pretend I'm not like this, but sometimes it would be easier to say fuck it and spew what I actually want to say. I just wish I was a more optimistic and confident person. I wish I wasn't me."
itsnotlando,2021-09-19 07:36:23+00:00,Feeling forever stuck,"I’ve come along way in my battle of depression and I mean for the most part I’ve been able to actually dig out happiness in my life. Recently I’ve started picking up the pieces. Decided to move back home and try to give school another go but I feel like I can’t do what I want to because as I can do great on tests but my long term memory is just awful. I’m trying to get into nursing school so that’s kind of important.

I was feeling moderately good about being alone after a toxic on and off relationship that lasted years ended. I gave it a good six months before I decided I was going to have some fun before college started up and end anything after that. Had a few flings and I hated it so my decision to end it was even more concrete but dang it if I didn’t meet the sweetest lady. Now I’ve never had a relationship where I felt a genuine spark right off the bat. Heck all of my previous relationships have been me jumping from one to the next to fill a whole so finding someone to actually share life with instead of filling emptiness is amazing. But with this girl it’s almost too much like we will legitimately finish each other’s sentences or make the same gestures completely unprompted which is awesome but also really scary for me.

All that being said she’s a phd student working in the psychology field and I have no problem with her being more intelligent than I am but I feel so defeated. School is going meh and man I just feel like I’m going to be working nothing jobs until I die. I hate it but at the same time I’m ok with it but now I feel even more hurt because although I’ve told this lady my plans and that even if it doesn’t work out I’ll find something because I always do. She says I’ll make a great nurse and doesn’t really say anything negative when I rebuttal that it may not come to fruition. I know I’m overthinking as we have only been seeing each other for a month and don’t even have any labels which is nice, but dang it I can’t stop my mind from thinking that if I can’t pull out a successful career path then this will die and although I’m in a spot now where I can accept that and appreciate the great times we are having now it makes me upset and depressed knowing that my financial situation will dictate my relationships in life. 

Idk I’m just a 25 year old dude and I feel so darn lost. I’m getting better at accepting life is just a series of happiness and that sometimes you have to let that happiness go but it still stinks ya know. Anyway if you read all this nonsense thanks and I hope life can give you a smile soon:)"
SKP1_1,2021-09-19 06:43:21+00:00,I’m in a very dark place,"I just finished my 5th week in college and It’s been hell. I joined a fraternity and I’ve been going through pledge ship, which is basically 8 weeks of being a slave to the actives and getting shit on constantly, and on top of all the shit I have to do for pledge ship I have classes. I don’t have time for myself anymore and this week I broke. I came home to clear my head and it helped a little but I’m still broken. I don’t want to go back. I don’t know if I can make it. 

None of this even compares to the fact that a week before I left for college I met up with my best friend of 5 years. I loved her more than anything and we met at a gas station so her bf wouldn’t get mad. We didn’t talk all summer and when I saw her I folded and poured my heart out to her. She simply cried got in her car and drove away. She went to s different college and I miss her more than anything. I used to always tell her we were meant to be. I always knew she was the one I was meant to be with. The last time I spoke to her before that night I told her “idk when but I know for a fact that we will be together one day” she said she agrees and she is excited for that day. We always went through phases of not talking to each other and being together 24/7. Any time we grew apart we found our way back to each other when we needed each other most. I’m in the most pain I have ever been and she’s hundreds of miles away. I think about her every second. I dream about her. She is my everything and I’m starting to think our story is over and it’s killing me. I’m in such a dark place. I see no light, I only see darkness. If you somehow read all of this help me I have no one. I’m so alone"

Gabriel_Fabianino,2021-09-19 02:11:15+00:00,This will sound pathetic,"Yesterday I went to a party after a long time, the night started great, I was having fun with some friends, but I discovered something that my best friend did and it really made me sad, I just wanted to have fun and forget about everything that was on my mind since this year began, yesterday just became another thing to upset me.

I sent a message to my other best friend explaining why our other best friend did and why our friends from school weren't talking to us anymore, I was drunk and the message made no sense.

So today I tried to disappear for a while, at first it was just to try to feel better just one time this year, it was working, until now. The friend I told the stuff didn't ask me if I was ok. This is so fucking pathetic, but this year has been hell, I'm feeling down for too much time, he knows it, everysingle time he disappears for any reason I ask him if he's ok (last year was rough for him and I don't feel like I was present enough, I was just there, I was afraid of asking stuff about it, afraid of him find it invasive and stop talking to me, so I was just there to try to make him feel better at that moment at least, but I knew something was wrong).

They are/were the reason I am/was still trying something, but now I feel like they don't consider me as much as I consider them. So yes, I'm upset because my friend didn't text me, didn't ask me anything about yesterday.

The other best friend sended some messages like normally, but I guess she knew why I didn't reply after a while, I didn't fight with her yesterday, It was a birthday party, I didn't want to be the center of attention or something to make yesterday a bad day for the others there. So I acted like I was ok, I wasn't, I'm not, she lied to me, she made me a fool for months.

It's hard for me to trust people, because of my mom and my whole family. My friends were there to help me, to be there, even when they didn't know, they were helping. I feel lonely now. I keep waiting for the message, wich is pathetic, it just means I depend on them.

She made our friends from school hate my other best friend and hate me (for a while, I talked to them yesterday but my other friend lives in other city), I defended him but it was pointless, so I just came home and slept.

As I said in the title, this is pathetic, but it's true and like it wasn't enough, I'm on my couch waiting some message for an hour and a half now. I planned to disappear to feel better, now I feel worse and lonely, like they don't care about me as much I care about them.

Do you still don't think this is pathetic? He texted me, but like he normally does, he sent me a tik tok, but I'm fucking upset because HE DIDN'T ASK ME IF I WAS OK, I disappeared for hours, I never do this, never.

Fuck this shit, it's embarrassing how pathetic this is omg."
-0Z0-,2021-09-19 02:04:07+00:00,There is nothing there,"I had a conversation recently with my sister in law, she stated (after a comment I made) that she was worried about me. So I asked her why.
The comment I made was angry I pointed out my frustration with my mother about her way of handeling certain issues.

My sister in law said: I am worried about you. She explained further that she used to know me as this ambitious young man filled with you and fueled by optimism and hope.

When she said it I teared up on the inside. Due to various reasons I couldn't tell her waht I though about it but I then noticed that I am a product of my upbringing and family. And for that same reason I might never be able to love anyone. There is nothing there. Whatever once was there has been drained by a continues force that is seeking to destroy me. And since I now have realized that there is probably nothing that I can do about that, I can only think about the least painfull why to search for end of my suffering."

zwipers,2021-09-19 00:07:10+00:00,Can't function.,"Confession 1: I lied in bed for practically 12 hours yesterday despite having fallen behind in my classes, despite having several assignments and a project due on Monday. I sat in front of my desk for about 20 minutes before going back to sleep. All I wanted to do was escape. It's become typical of me to just procrastinate, try and forget about my responsibilities, and waste my entire fucking day. I didn't have the energy to wake up at 8am, stay awake till 12pm, and during that time: cook, exercise, drink water, run errands, tidy up, do assigned readings, take notes, work on a few programs. i.e. something productive. I only managed to shower, wash my hair, and do laundry. And I ordered garbage for lunch. Skipped breakfast and dinner because I was asleep. Oh, and scrolled mindlessly through \[various social media platforms\], for about an hour or so.

I know exactly what I should be doing. I plan obsessively and make simple, realistic goals for myself. Where I want to be a year from now. Daily tasks. Deadlines. Checklists. For no reason other than to cope, I guess. Whatever. I'm in a position to make things easier for myself. I asked for accommodations. I did my first year at a local cc, senior year of hs. I'm on track to graduate early, and not take on any debt. I wanted to transfer to my state school, but I've held off on that, because it really depends on how well I do this semester. So that's my main focus. I'm currently taking 16 credits. Everything seems manageable. Relatively straightforward. Those are my only priorities. I've never worked a day in my life. I'm never asked to do anything. I can't claim to be stressed or burnt out. Can hardly justify frequent breaks or naps.

I'll have bursts of motivation and energy occasionally. But so does everyone else. The only difference is that I lack basic discipline. I'm never consistent with said goals. I'm so frustrated with myself. I can't fuck up. I can't coast. I don't know why I behave in such a way that... Sigh. Idk. It's like I'm taking everything for granted. My life currently isn't hard at all, and it has the potential to get unimaginably harder. This system makes life so precarious for so many people. And It doesn't make sense for me to be fully aware of this yet still make terrible decision after terrible decision. I don't want to disappoint myself and others. I don't want to throw away opportunities (that I'd never get to see again). I mean, that alone should be enough to motivate me. Idk what it'll have to take.

I can't bring myself to cry about this or feel sorry for myself. Maybe it'd make me feel better. I tried a few months ago, in hopes to completely get it out of my system. But halfway into my session it all just seemed so pointless. And so I stopped. I've developed awful habits. I constantly give in. Also, I can't stand reading old journal entries of me upset over this, just because I'm in the exact same position, months later. I wish I had high functioning depression or could live life on autopilot. I'm just so sick and tired...of being sick and tired. It's like I need someone to mercilessly bully me into helping myself. Until it becomes routine. So that I don't even have to think twice about any of this.

Confession 2: sometimes I take my sibling's Adderall (15 mg). This seems to be the only thing that'll help me stay awake. Allowing me to actually do something with myself. Like today. But it's a rare event, because I don't want to draw suspicion. I'll slightly crash afterwards. I don't think Vyvanse has this effect. But that's besides the point because I don't have an ADHD diagnosis, let alone a prescription. I did testing last year. However, nothing in the past had indicated that I had ADHD (did well in school, no behavioral issues, etc.). All of this started about 2ish years ago. And so the psychologist pretty much attributed the poor test results, my demeanor, and whatever else to: clinical depression. So I ended up having to stay on the Wellbutrin, which hardly seems to help anymore. I might go back to coffee. All of it just ramps up my anxiety but I suppose that's the tradeoff.

Nothing left to say here."

Like ya I’m trying to do with stuff my therapist said to do but it’s slow going. I don’t understand how my friends can call me “their favorite person on the front end” where I work and mean it. I don’t get it. My parents don’t even give a shit. 90% of our interactions are them complaining about how much I SHOULD be doing. I mean, I get it, I am a 24f and I am still in college. Trying for a third time and I am still having issues figuring out what I fully wanna do. I don’t even know what I’m doing with my life. On top of this I have autism and every time I get set on something I wanna do I think of reasons why I won’t succeed. How is that someone likable? Let alone worthy of being “a favorite person”."

Hrquestion92,2021-09-18 13:25:01+00:00,My daughter died yesterday,"My wife and I were pregnant with our first child. We were 5 days away from a scheduled csection (39 weeks) when we found out her heart stopped. She still had to deliver her and we got time with her. She was the most beautiful baby I’ve ever seen. I’ve never seen something so pure and fill me with complete love. I would do anything for her and if somehow there was a way to switch places I wouldn’t hesitate to do it. 

We saw her a few hours after delivery (she was on ice) and she was starting to deteriorate already. It broke my heart completely. My wife is still recovering in the hospital (I haven’t left her side), but the hospital needs us to make a decision on the mortuary which leads us to the decision of cremation vs burial. With cremation it’s has the upside of taking her with us wherever we go, but hearing that there isn’t a single cell or dna in those ashes, destroys me. Having her buried also hurts me because she will only ever know being alone. I want to be with my baby girl. She needs her daddy to protect her.

Everytime i bring out the conversation to them, they seems to be not understanding and they just reassure me even i am ugly i can be happy if not just living single alone stay with them.

Haunting-Mongoose152,2021-09-18 11:00:57+00:00,I think I'm depressed,"I posted on here the other day and i didn't do into much detail and I didn't get much help so I'm doing it again in more detail.

I'm 15 and I'm almost always feeling sad, I might just be having a conversation with my friends feeling ok and then suddenly I just feel like shit. Other days I will just wake up sad and feel bad for the rest of the day.

One of the main things that makes me feel this way is school, every day I wake up for school I feel so bad. I'm not getting bullied but I live in London where there are a lot of 'roadmen' or people who think they are and they just push everyone else around for no reason, its probably for validation from the others or something but idk. That's not the only reason i hate school, another reason is that my grades have been getting worse and worse it feels like I'm getting stupider every day, I'm not motivated to do anything about it either, I'm not motivated to do anything for that matter.

Another reason that makes me feel bad is my family, I am part of a stable functioning family which I am grateful for but the are just soooooo annoying. My mum came into my room earlier today to ""make my room nicer"", she wasn't doing anything in particular her just being there really pissed me off. I also have to pretend I'm in a good mood around my family because I don't want tell them how I am actually feeling which only makes me feel worse.

I have to make a whole paragraph about my brother because he just makes me feel horrible. The other day me, my dad and my brother went to see some family friends and my brother (who is 12) said to their kids (who are around the same age) that i hardly ever leave my room. This made me feel so bad especially when they all stared making fun of me. He does things like that all the time and it makes me feel terrible. 

It's true that I hardly ever leave my room, the only time that I will leave is to get food or to go to school. It's because I'm not motivated. Not being motivated is kinda bad because I have my GCSE's (English equivalent of high school diploma) in about half a year and I am not motivated to revise for them and I'm worried that I might fuck up my future but I still don't do anything about it.

Probably the biggest reason that makes me feel sad is that my cat died a few weeks ago, his name was Chester and he was my best friend and I loved him so much. I had only had him for about a year when he got hit by a car when I was on holiday. I still have another cat, her name is Sunday, but she isn't like him. She is really timid and only likes being stroked when she is on her favourite chair. Chester would come into my room and snuggle next to me on my bed but now he is gone and there is a hole in my life and it feels like my home is just a house without him. I'm crying now, I miss him so much. We are probably going to get another kitten but it won't be the same.

That is all I have to write about, it felt good getting it all out."
NNAPSTERR,2021-09-18 10:14:53+00:00,My parents are the reason I am here.,"I was going through my reddit post history and found so many posts, so many months apart when I was going to finally do it but here I am!

It is all because of my parents. I cant even express it how much I love them. 

I am still depressed and probably much more than the last time I posted here and think about ending  it more frequently but cannot do it just because I am so scared of the aftermath of my death and the toll it will take on my parents and family.

I have tried everything to make them mad and do something irrational to me so that I can finally get my excuse to get off from this world but it never worked."

my mom screamed at me again just now. she thinks theres something wrong with me, im being possessed or something. but truth is the reason im being distant, quiet and emotionless. im like this because im holding myself back. im one trigger away from screaming this house down and fighting everyone. the silent treatment might be harsh but it's the only way i can keep sane. 

just now for the first time ever i tried to hurt myself. i start hitting myself on my forehead, scratching my arms hard. and when that's not enough, i went to get the scissors and starts stabbing the inside of my arms. but it wasnt that hard and the scissors arent that sharp to make a wound. but the pain was enough of a release. i get it now why ppl hurt themselves."

I also have no interests or passions or a job because of my full time student schedule, so I feel like a complete waste of a person. I just turned 23 and I am not excited at all for the future. I just want to be in my room and I do not care to socialize with anyone. I've also no friends so I come to the internet to look for advice/help. Any advice or tips?"

I've tried everything. Therapy, meditation, medication, religion and I even tried ignoring it. It keeps getting worse. Every time I think I'm improving I reach a new low. Thought I was getting better, began I cutting myself. Thought the medication was working but then I started abusing any pills I could find. Just to cloud my mind, drown out my thoughts.

I'm tired, exhausted really. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not suicidal but I don't exactly care about what happens to me anyways. I can't even believe that I've resorted to the internet to feel like someone cares. Everyone that knows about my depression is tired of me. They haven't said it to my face but I can feel them drifting away.

I can't live like this but I'm tired of trying to fix it. I don't know anymore. My mind doesn't work properly and I'm constantly in a daze. Is this ever going to change? I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to embracing death. This mundane existence isn't worth my time anymore."

lilith_moon23,2021-09-17 22:06:37+00:00,Nothing feels right,"I don’t really know how to start this off but, here goes nothing. 

-a little background story-

I’ll be 28 in a few months, I’ve married to the love of my life since April of 2020 (met in early 2013), we have a 6 year old child together with another on the way. He has a child from a previous marriage who is 11 who he has partial custody of but her mother is very difficult to work with. She kept their daughter away from us from March 2020-June 2021 due to Covid. We had to go to court to get her back. Moving on. We both work and make okay money. We have a loving marriage but do argue about stupid things (probably too much lol). 
We have good relationships with our parents and siblings. We have great friends. I have everything I need. But I still feel an emptiness that grows more each day. I lost my dad in May of 2010. I lost so many friends from then until now. Too many to count. Drugs, accidents, murders. I lost my grandma January of last year ON MY MOMS BIRTHDAY. I’ve been hurting for so long. Then the hurt stopped. It became rage followed with an emptiness that I can’t escape.  I feel so guilty for having these feelings. I know so many others have it much worse than I do. I just want to feel whole again."

Ever since the pandemic and even before that I felt pretty lonely and pretty hurt etc. as a result of it. 
Plus I don’t really had a „real“ relationship yet (even tho i hugged,kissed,held hand etc with one girl at my old school for like 2,3 months before she broke up with me cause she believed some questionable memo with apparently my voice on it who said some things I donno) even tho someone else might think otherwise cause well I kissed,cuddled and made out (everything but sex cause I’m still a virgin at almost 24 😞😭) etc with a different girl and kissed a few others over the time etc. But now i feel like I donno I can’t anymore 😞😞 Also my „problem“ might be that I always fell/fall in love with friends/someone close to me which is maybe an „issue“ as well. But then again for some people it works almost to well…. 🥺🥺 Then at the beginning of 2021 I  tried tinder which well was/is an total disappointment cause you can’t really get any matches/conversations whatsoever cause apparently girls can’t text you let alone text back…… And since a few days I don’t know why I text/snap with an friend of mine about what’s going on, about her life, about someone, what she’s doing and such things. And because she sent me some cute pics (like her cleavage, bra) and talks about sex toys with me I thought she might mean me which turns out is probably not the case…… And because I’m getting kinda desperate I also tried to talk through the flower with my mom about getting an masturbator (please don’t judge 😞) which she told me like always „I should focus on getting an job“ (as if that’s easy right now), maybe getting „more fit“ even tho I’m not obese but ok „I’m single too“ (as if that makes it better) if you have too much money you can give to me etc. 😡😞 and now so I don’t write a book (sorry 😞😞) 

I just wanna be happy, feel loved and just don’t be alone anymore….is that too much ask for? (If anyone really reads this I appreciate you genuinely 💖)"

Whether it be a simple thing such as walking too loud. Or laughing too loud. I hate everyone. I want to be alone 24/7. I'm pissed off at everyone 24/7, in my head or out loud. 

I hate myself. I'm so unhappy with life. I have been unhappy since around 7/8. I don't know what's wrong with me? I constantly think about how great life would be if I was alone all the time. I wish I was born different. My childhood wasn't the best or the worst? 
I have nothing to be sad about. 

I don't worry about barely anything. I don't know why I can't just feel content? 

Why couldn't I have been born right? 

I'm a terrible person. I wish my family was never born. I hate them all. I hate life. I hate myself. I hate everyone. I want a normal life.

Someone tell me I'm a terrible person. Im so fucking sick of people saying, ""it'll get better"" because it fucking won't. I hate myself. I can't live like this any longer.

I'm sick of school. If we have a lesson about mental health issues then everyone in class messes around and the teachers act if this isn't happening to people.

I have a school counsler (kinda), I haven't seen her in about 2 months and I don't want to again. I have to if I want to be reffered to someone more professional (I'm trans and also trying to get support for that). I hate it. It's so quiet. It makes me worse. I'm so fucking weak, crying infront of someone.

I hate my body and everything about me. Why couldn't I just be born a boy who is tall, skinny and emotionally stable?

I fucking hate all my 'friends'.

I walk to school with this 'friend'. We don't talk hardly. I hate talking. She has such a quite and squeaky voice, its so annoying. She asks me a question and I answer, then she asks her other friends the same questions. I fucking hate her.

I want to die. I hate life.

These friends joke about how I'm 'depressed'. They dont fucking get it. I'm so fucking depressed. I want to fucking die.

I hate my life. Nothing good will ever happen to me.

I feel joy for a few seconds, then it's gone. It sinks in that I'm laughing and how stupid I am.

Im constantly embarrassed.

I don't do anything because I feel so much embassment.

I wish I had the nerve to shout at people.

I don't want friends. I don't care. I don't need friends. I just end up hurting them or they hurt me.

I hate doing things. I hate living. I hate eating. I hate everything and everyone.

Theres so way in hell I'm getting better.

It's been years since I first tried to get help. But it never worked out.

If I live to be an adult I'm just going to turn into a 'stereotypical mentally ill villain'. I have no hope. I just want someone to listen. I hate everything. Help me."

aatemporaryusername,2021-09-17 18:19:43+00:00,I am done,"so where should I begin...
I am 16M and I want to kill myself.


The reason behind it is, that Life just got boring to me.
My life loop starts all over everyday. I get up, go to school, think how I should kill myself, where and what will be the consequences, then go home and think what I should do for the rest of the day. 

I have no friends, never was in a relationship and am antisocial, even though I don't like this word, because it is being overused. 
I was outside with someone like 2 or 3 times in my life... 
I probably could find myself friends, but I don't have any hobbies or anything. I don't find anything interesting, and would be hard to even begin a conversation. I taught myself how to live without anybody and for now I just listen to music all the time, so I won't think. I am over thinking, that's why.
The only ""friend"" I got is the one I got on Discord and I am just keeping a contact with him because he also has no real friends and He doesn't want to end this. I could, but I am keeping it judt because of him.

I repeated a class, because of me. I could say, that it's all depression, isolation and online schools fault, but it's mine. 
I made a mistake, and need to live with it. The most strange thing I find is that people in the old class I used to know for the past 4 years (I also had no friends there, long story), now ignore me amd threat me like I don't exist. Also got used to it. 


I picked my school as a place for suicide. Probably will cut my veins and wait until blood flows out of my body. 
It's a bad place, because somebody could notice it, but believe me, when there are so many people, no one will notice one teenager sitting, and waiting while the blood flows from the hand.

Well, I have no dreams. I don't want to become anybody in the future. The only thing that is frustrating me are the consequences of my suicide. 

My mother wants us to move to a larger city, and have a better place for living. My father wants to get a better job and has got a chance for it now. My siblings are probably about to get they're own families om they're heads (yes, I am the youngest...), and of course If I'll kill myself (or survive a suicide attempt), it will be my fault of ruining their lifes, as always with everything... 

The things I probably regret in my life are probably not finding friends, so I could be more social, not finding a girlfriend for a relationship and never knowing what people mean with ""love"" and realising it too late.

I hate it but I couldn't tell him because im scared of him. He touched my thigh the other day and he pulled me by my arm yesterday. I tried pulling back and pull me closer and told me to stop acting dumb. I said im not acting dumb and he continued to make and argument about it that I had no say in. He is always commenting on how less or how much I eat and I hate it. I never had a good relationship with my mom and he knows that but he keeps saying that im gonna end up just like her. Im never gonna end up like that bitch because if I ever have children im not gonna lock them up or abuse them, I would never have other adults take care of my child for years of there life until they don't even know how to live in the normal world without being told what to do and when to do it!

Comfortable_Today671,2021-09-17 03:55:36+00:00,Help,"Im 16. A month ago I got scammed and lost a lot of money, I started crying, and when I cry I think about the past present and future. I think about all the shity things in my life and when I cry I get a lot of negative things go into my head and negative thoughts about myself. I was crying for 2 days, I ran away and was just by myself, crying. I didn’t eat or drink for 36 hours and wasn’t hungry either. I tried to kill myself, I took a lot of pills, the next day I told my parents and then I went to the ER. I try not cry and try to stay calm because whenever I cry I can’t stop and negative thoughts swarm me. I get irritable and angry a lot sometimes at my mom, I yell at her or snap at her and then I feel like an asshole and I start to cry about it sometimes. Sometimes I get so irritated I almost break something but I hold it back. The earliest incident I d smth like this happening was when I was 10 but it  wasnt that bad. So anyways my attempt happened like a minth ago. i alwaye make stupid descisions and i was caught stealing and i got of witu a warning and have to pay a fine. my dad called me an asshole and selfish, and i startd crying. All these negative thoughts abot me started to come bqck. My head hurts and I feel like vomitting. I feel like an asshole and worthless piece of shit and a little suicidal.

litstikk,2021-09-17 03:49:32+00:00,Should I Stay or Should I Go?,"Hello everyone, so my job is mentally breaking me down at the moment and I just wanted to get some extra opinions to make sure it’s not just me and that maybe this is just what comes with the territory of working in your career. I’ll give a little background first then I’ll dive into the problem. Feel free to provide any incite, it all will help. I am really trying to decide if I need to leave my job or simply suck it up. 

Background: I recently graduated college and the way it happened was really rushed and happened so fast that I didn’t have time to dive into making sure I had a good quality job (I’m not complaining about that… I’m very aware of my decisions. I just feel like this is part of the problem as well.) 

l landed a job as a writer at a local publication in my city. I kind of took the first thing that was offered to me because everything was moving so fast and I wanted to have some type of job in my career after graduating. Everything was good at first, I was super excited about working: I came into on time, last one to leave, asked questions to make sure I was doing what was expected, etc.  

To make a long story a bit shorter I quickly started to realize my boss is a narcissist, his boss is a narcissist, all the men there are narcissists. Everyone is significantly older than me and I am one of the few females working there. I think this is where I’ll stop with the background because I feel like if I give any more information this will easily be identifiable lol. 

Current issue: The issue that I’m having is I feel like there is a big disconnect with them, I don’t feel heard or understood, I honestly am expected to have no life, my boss knows I have deadlines that HE provided to me but will throw random stuff at me right before the deadline. I deal with emotional and psychological narcissistic abuse and quite frankly, unprofessional behavior: snarky comments, passive aggressive behavior, bad tempers. As a result I’ve been really depressed, self-esteem is lowering and I have been isolating from from family and friends. I’ve had ups and downs with my mental health before, but honestly I just feel like it’s at an all time low now. 

Question to you all: Of course what I’ve told you all is honestly just half of what I’ve been experiencing. But from what I have informed you all of…should I simply suck it up or get out of there?"

Said things felt “different” and didn’t want to do it anymore, didn’t want to try anymore. I moved home to my mom’s. I stayed there for a week and a half. And he called me, FaceTimed me, to tell me he missed me. I’m basically a fucking sheep because I immediately went back, slept with him, and agreed when he said we should work things out. But then this week….was so bizarre. I had a close friend from my past pass away from a drug overdose, I had a lot of stress at work, and it felt like he wasn’t there. No hug, no concern for how I was feeling, nothing. Like empathy doesn’t even exist in his world. So here I am, wondering what feeling he would have if I ended my life. Would it be anything? Would anybody feel anything? If it’s so easy to ignore everyone else’s feelings, then why am I still here thinking Id hurt everyone else if I left. What is actually keeping me here. Is this all just an excuse to keep myself from doing it? Should I do it anyway?"

I’m 17, an immigrant and while I’m legally living in the country, I’m still an immigrant raised in different cultures,communities, etc. I started my first day of school yesterday and I’ve never felt more vulnerable, uncomfortable, out of place and just depressed (not taking it lightly at all). I’ve been crying nonstop and throwing up and just feeling terrible over all. I don’t wanna go to this school again. People haven’t been very nice and the staff hasn’t been understanding at all to the fact that I’m new there. Some teachers chose to give classes in another language (knowing that I don’t understand) and it’s been a mess. My parents and family keep telling me to give it time and as immature as it sound, I honestly don’t want to. I want to go back to my home country and while that’s a mess too at least I have friends and family and my boyfriend. But if I go to my home country I don’t want to leave my parents for 8 months until I graduate. I’m sorry if this breaks any rules or something but I just really feel like I need to talk it out and my parents are also struggling with so much so I don’t want to stress them."

Madame_Shanzy,2021-09-16 16:07:50+00:00,Sitting in a bathroom stall because I can't ever get shit 100% perfect,"I'm so fucking tired. Between school, a job, and a family - I just want it all to stop. The highlights are great and all, but every time I make a ""mistake"", it's like the end of the world. And I don't know if it's my perception of what a mistake means, or if the person who was mad at me for it is the one causing me to feel this way. 

So, between driving to school an hour and half away, or my job an hour away, or my partner to work which is 30 minutes away. I always seem to not make it to picking up my partner from his job at 1 am once a week. Then this huge argument happens because he tells me I need to do something to make sure I'm awake when I need to leave. 

I get defensive because of our history together and feel like he doesn't get to tell me what I need to do. Maybe it is my fault for the blow out of proportion argument. But honestly, i can't stand it when people are upset with me, so I get even more upset with them for being upset with me.

Is that narcissism? Am I a fucking narcissistic pos? My partner is legally not allowed to drive, so it's left up to me to do it all for the both of us. All I ask is not to get bitched at for maybe falling asleep when I've been literally up driving, doing school or work all day from 630 am till usually midnight or in this case, 1 am. 

I fell asleep and now im the disrespectful asshole who can't seem to get it right. 😒 these situations make me want to kill myself or run off to another country. I don't know if it's me or him, or the situation anymore. 

Did I tell y'all I battle with alcoholism? So on top of feeling like shit 24/7 and taking antidepressants for it - I always want to drink. If it wasn't so bad for my mind, body and soul - I'd be wasted 24/7. Now all I want to do is drink. Fuck today and yesterday for that matter. 😪"
MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-16 14:52:37+00:00,Does anyone else wish for an apocalypse?,"I just feel like I belong in a world like that. The thought of living in a world that’s ended is, I dunno, comforting somehow. I don’t think I’d miss the modern amenities too much, already too jaded to enjoy anything anyway. Too depressed to care about entertainment or hot water or any of that shit. Already eat canned food most nights. I dunno, I guess it’s easy to say while you’ve got them, but I really think I could live just fine without all the shit.

And I dunno what it is about an apocalypse that really appeals, maybe it’s the constant threat of death. Which is weird, cause I’m always suicidal (I guess that’s another benefit for me too, it’s liable to just kill me), but something about the stakes almost always being life or death, I feel like that would actually motivate me to actually *want* to live. Or maybe it’s just the adrenaline or the constant distraction of potential danger. But I feel like it kickstart my survival instinct. At least for a while.

Or maybe it’s more that everything about life almost becomes a problem to solve and the side of my brain that likes focusing on external problems rather than my own internal ones likes the idea of that. There’d be a never-ending stream of problems to solve, lighting fires, building shelters, figuring out how to jury rig infrastructure like power, plumbing, water heating systems, animal traps, farming solutions, all these things, every day something new. Get bored or frustrated with solving one problem?  Well, provided it’s not critical to your survival, you can just drop it and move onto something more appealing at the time. Just move from practical task to practical task forever. But not just random bullshit you’re only doing to distract yourself, actual important things, thing with genuine applications to you daily life, things that are actually useful and they you personally will use and see continuous benefits from solving.

Or maybe it’s just the thought of finally being free. Money won’t matter. “Success” won’t matter. Your ability to work a meaningless 9-5 without wanting to fucking kill yourself won’t matter. Only wits and resourcefulness and only traits with actual value will matter. If someone fucks with you, you can just shoot them. If someone deserves to die, you’re free to make it so. And people are free to do the same to you. Feels real, in a way. Like the field is levelled. Less reason to hold up all these facades and mask who you really are from people. Not in every case obviously. But I feel like “social games” would become a lot simpler. And honestly, I’d actually finally be free to be totally separate from people. Don’t need to go to a job, don’t need to deal with banks, or governments or any of those other inescapable reactions you’re forced into, even if you live as secluded as possible in today’s word.

I just feel like I’d prefer an apocalypse in a lot of ways. I feel like I don’t fit anywhere in the world as it exists today, but my brain, the issues that it has, the specific ways it’s broken, I just feel like it would finally be able to thrive in a brutal, dead world. I feel like that’s the world I’m already adapted to, yet I’m stuck in this one. I think about this a lot."

Sometimes it takes everything in you too not break down in tears.
But sometimes it feels like it's the better thing to do. Don't hold it in, just let it all flow. It feels like your head is barely above water, slowly sinking and when you feel like you finally got a way to pull yourself out but the more you struggle the deeper you go. False hope. Why fight it? It's easier just to be consumed by the darkness, maybe I'll finally get rest. But there's always something worth fighting for. Something keeping you afloat. Love. I never believed in it but it's the only thing keeping me going.
Maybe it can pull me out of this dismal abyss. I have to keep my head above water."

I’m angry, I’m constantly depressed and I haven’t felt happy for as long as I can remember. Nothing good happens, life just throws more and more shit at me and my only reward for overcoming obstacles is more, bigger obstacles. It never fucking ends. And normally you’d expect there to be some fucking give and take but there’s no give, just take. I’ve lived 17 years in this planet and I have nothing good at all to show for it. No really meaningful positive experiences, no friends, not girlfriend, no money or security, fucking nothing. 

All my thoughts right now are dark and suicidal and even if I had someone to talk to about it there’s no fucking point. Only people I could talk to are one of those fucking hotlines and they’re just gonna say the same fucking things people always say and it’s total bullshit. 

“You’ve just gotta get out there and keep trying”, no thanks, tried that and the more I go out into the world the less I wanna be in it. eat right, take my medications, every morning and all the shit you’re supposed to do, I am trying, it just doesn’t fucking help. 

“There’s people that care about you” wrong again, nice thought and I bet that one works on most people but I literally don’t have anyone that would so much as bat a fucking eye if I died. 

“Things will get better”, oh yeah? And where’d you learn those psychic abilities, Doctor ? You don’t know shit about my future, and I guaran-fucking-tee you no one would have put a bet on how much shit has gone wrong for me so far because of how incredibly unlikely it is for a person to get so unlucky so I’ll start believing that one as soon as I get even a shred of evidence to support it. That’s like losing your job and deciding not to look for a new one cause you *might* win the lottery.

Today I just couldn't even breathe and I felt static and wanted to cry out. I told my mom how I was feeling. I was scared of getting judged or being screamed at. My mom didn't really understand me, but she tried. She gave me a hug. She said that she'll look into psychiatrists for me and accompany me. I might finally get the help I think I need. I don't have much hope though, I read people here were feeling worse after going to a psychiatrist, and it makes me think I shouldn't go at all. Idk, but I'll try."

Sometimes I just see wanna be gone. Start over or not at all and just not be me. Someone better or actually a good person who’s competent and doesn’t just do the bare minimum. 

But then I remember I can’t change. I don’t wanna change but I want to change but I don’t. I stay where I am because I don’t know how to actually change.

Have you ever felt like your heart is being ripped apart and someone choking you when you are left with your thoughts. Despite how hard you try, how hurt you feel, your tears just doesn't want to come out. You could feel your eyes getting wet, you could feel it welling up, but no matter how long you wait it never run down your cheeks.

It just feels like you've run out of tears from all  the countless night you've cried yourself to sleep praying and hoping that the moment you wake up your problem would somehow is magically solved. 

Why can't i cry like i used to anymore? Why can't i cry just like i used to when she broke up with me. Why can't i cry myself to sleep anymore just like how used to when all my job application is left unanswered. Why can't i cry to make myself feel better after all the hardship that i've been throught. Why can't i stay up crying the whole night anymore when i feel lonely. No matter how hurt i am right now, i just can't cry anymore. No matter how hard i tried it just wont come out."

sorrowfulself,2021-09-15 05:28:05+00:00,I am losing it. I need help.,"I am losing it. I want to scream and cry. I don't foresee myself getting any sleep tonight I am just freaking out. Tonight I got a TikTok notification saying that I received a message and I clicked on it because \*redacted\* is the only one that has ever sent me TikTok messages so I got excited. What I wasn't expecting was the message to be for her, I forgot that a while back she signed onto TikTok on my phone and that is what the message was from. She got a TikTok from a guy and it included sexual inuendos and she sent some back tonight. It instantly made me go into a panic attack and I don't know what to do. This isn't like her, she would never just like hook up with guys, she has too much respect for herself. I don't know if it's because she's been having a hard time and she has no respect for herself or what but I am losing it. For the past 2 months, 2 weeks, and 2 days, I have done nothing but work towards getting back together with her because we agreed we wanted our story together to continue. Brandon, I can't lose her. I don't know what I would do. I want to call her so bad, I want to get back together with her so bad. I don't know why she is doing this. She said she misses me and wants me to prove myself to her. I don't know if I can wait till Thursday to reach out. to talk to her. Maybe she is doing it because she is upset that things are working with us right now. I don't know.I want to pray and hope that it is all good and I am just mistaking things but I am scared. I love her too much and I care about her too much to lose her like this. I am just so confused as to what she is doing and I am terrified that it is too late for us. I so desperately want her in my life, we have so many plans together that I don't see myself doing with anyone else, that I don't think anyone else is ambitious enough to take on with me. I know \*redacted\* is though and I so desperately want that. I just don't know anymore. I feel like I am in a torture chamber and \*redacted\* is unintentionally torturing me. My brain is spinning and I feel like I am in shock. \*redacted\* has too much respect for herself to be acting like I think she is, so maybe she just has been having a rough time and has lost respect for herself I don't know. all I know is that I have looked at the same polaroid picture of us every day for the past couple of weeks hoping and praying that we can take more. I just want to go into couples therapy so we can strengthen and improve our relationship together. That is all I want. I feel like she ended it before we even tried to put in the work for it. 

Just sent this message to my therapist, I don't know what to do guys. I am mentally losing it and I feel alone and all I want to do is cry and scream and break everything around me. I am done filtering or rewording things. I just need to be blatant. I don't know what to do. There is a lot of context missing from this post, but it is so relevant right now. Please. Someone help."
HasmitaDasari,2021-09-15 05:02:34+00:00,Drowning in this instability. Help me out if-,"If people gonna think I'm committing die for some lame ass reason. I, for a fact, know that this ain't no lame ass reason. No where even close to it. But I'm afraid how people are going to take this as, and blame the person I love the most who is now daunted by me. It's been 15 months and I still can't let go of it. I tried to uninstall my existence in the month of January but unluckily it failed. I started cracking jokes on my failed suicide so that people think I'm fine. Little did they know it only got even worse. 

Well, anyways, I just want a honest suggestion or opinion or whatever on me committing die because of the emptiness and also peak emotional burden from the break up. 

Fyi, it's not like some normal love shit. I, for real, loved him to death and I still do. I would give up on anything on this earth for him, except for my parents. I already had given up on doing pot and chem (to which I was too addicted to) because he wanted me to stop. But only after he left me have I stopped it. All the regrets I have, I can't hold them anymore. It's either Him giving me a last chance which doesn't seem to likely happen or elimination of my existence. I've begged him but he was hurt to roots because of what he had gone through because of me. So I can't blame him. But I also consider that this grief, it is the price we pay for the love. So you all tell me wtf am I supposed to do. Follow the saying ""Better to burn out than to fade away""?
To Live my whole life just by driving this dead empty meat suit with nothing but heart heavy of sadness and negative shit like anxiety, anger issues, instability and etc or to commit die at this instant to be free from all of this?"

I hate knowing that my friends are expecting me to login to a zoom call on the weekends to hang out and message me if I don't turn up to ask me where I am or why I' not joining. Or if my colleagues are all going to lunch together and expect me to join and ask me 20 questions about why I don't want to go with them.

I get so agitated by it and often find myself responding with a rude or nasty comment, that I don't usually mean but I just want them to stop asking me about it. 

I'm also not good at being tied to a schedule for work, most of my colleagues start around 8.30am or 9am but I like to come and go as I please. I figure as long as I get the work done what does it matter if I login at 7am or 10am?

Hipeground,2021-09-15 00:15:38+00:00,"I feel like I may be feeling my same emotions again, I'm scared I'll fuck up badly once again, and again and again.","Last year October is when everything went to shit and I came into the most deep depression in my life, so much I was thinking of suicide but I never went through with it. At first it was just a fall out of one of my closest friends (well more than a fall out) and then in such a quick amount of time,like a chain reaction it went onto the thoughts of my own existence. 

The more I thought about it the more evidence I could find on reasons why I shouldn't be here, looking over the course of my life.The way how I felt was the worst I could ever imagine, it was so heavy on my shoulders, a really bad headache,  and the constant thought of suicide in my mind never left, and it just kept on coming ,there was not a single distraction that could take me away from it.

 I remember I would come home walking so slowly with the same thoughts going round and round, feeling so heavy and deep in my thoughts, I'd head to my room keep the curtains open and just lie there in the dark doing nothing all day, just looking out through the window watching the cars go by, and thinking of ways to die. I tried to get rid of my fear of death and that worked for a while.  Over the course of 6 months or more I had written many suicide notes.

Coming near December I had done a lot of research on the best methods, the fatality rate, how much would count as an over dose for certain medication and the side effects it would bring, along with it's consequences if I survive, but also i thought if I should be going to a mental hospital. I had a plan on how I was gonna do it, when it was gonna happen, I didn't wanna make it past Christmas. 

At the end of school I told a few people related to the fall out goodbye, and they could obviously tell I wasn't ok and sure enough from that got a few things revolved, but falling out with out some friends was no longer a reason to add onto reasons of suicide and those thoughts had continued into feb - March of this year gradually fading. 

Onto now, after nearly a year this has begun, I have gone into new education and surprisingly made some friends to hang out with. Yesterday I was texting them and suddenly the feelings come back but in quite a different way, so much more light and numb , my surroundings feel like a blur. I start crying and feeling so much more depressed than usual with no reason, I feel like I'm going back down again where I was. 

And because of this, I'm  scared I'll end up being more of a fuck up than I already am, I'm feeling like a big burden to everyone once again and I should just leave everyone alone, I feel stuck as usual and I dont know whay to do,I promised my girlfriend I wouldn't have to go through the same process of Intense suicidal thoughts. 

I'm confused and filled with a little dread,I'm afraid to loose everyone to my mental health once again. I feel like I'm making the same situation happen, I'm listening to the same songs again that i had listened to at that time, it feels like everything is coming back but in a different way once again,
 and it just happens to be around the same time as last year,"

Amazing-Most-1085,2021-09-14 22:39:14+00:00,What's the difference when you beg for love?,"I had an extremely good day today despite being at the peak of my current depressive episode. It only gets better from here though so that's good.

Despite my amazing accomplishment I couldn't help but throw the day away. I stood awake for no more than 30 minutes to complete my sale and then quickly drifted off to sleep for another 10 hours. 

What was the point of staying awake? The deal was made and my job was done. Nobody cares... I have nobody to share this with, nobody to celebrate with.

Paying a porn star hundreds of miles away to tell me she's proud and loves me doesn't mean shit anymore if it's not genuine. Begging for attention on here is also just as pathetic. If I don't do either I'm still just as alone as if I did.

I just don't know why it's so difficult for me to form meaningful connections.

Maybe I'm scared to open myself up because I don't want to get hurt? Maybe I'm ashamed of myself? I guess this is something I have to work on.

I've pushed the last of my ""friends"" away because every time I bring people together I end up alone and they do their own thing. 

I'll take today to remind myself that I'm the only one who matters in my life. I'm the only one who's going to get me to where I need to be. No more spending money or time on fake friends and fake love. 

I need to be better for myself and nobody else and I hope I can use today as inspiration to remind myself of what I'm capable of, so that I can continue to push myself and reach MY goals. Hopefully I'll actually meet some nice people along the way.

TLDR:   
 I'm not sure why I wrote this, but if anyone can take something away from this, I hope it's that if you're feeling alone it's because you are. Stop wasting your energy trying to get the affection of people who don't matter or care the way you do about them. Because when you do get that attention from them it's probably only because you now have something that they want. Your energy is better off being put into self care and finding hobbies that make you feel good. And hey, maybe we'll meet some actual genuine people along the way."

in_the_shire,2021-09-14 15:36:16+00:00,You will not find anyone more pathetic than me.,"I’m 29. Haven’t had friends since high school. I’m awkward and shy, and come off as weird to everyone around me when I do my damndest to be normal. 

I hate my job. It takes so much out of me. Hours will pass and I can’t even recall any specific details. It’s just the same repetitive taste over and over, hour after hour, day after day. 

I play video games to escape. I am more or less obsessed with them to the point that if I talk with someone online, all I wanna do is talk about games for the most part. 

I’ve also resorted to waifuism. Real waifuism, with no sense of irony. I don’t tell people about it, or do anything that would let on that I’m in an imaginary relationship with someone who doesn’t exist anyway, but that’s the world I try to live in inside my head. It’s just one thing that helps me get to sleep a little easier at night. 

I’ve let myself go. I bathe and brush my teeth. I’m hygienic at least. But my home is a mess. My beard and hair is out of control. I cry in my car during lunch breaks. I come off as an angry incel when I don’t mean to. I can’t form sentences; like when I talk, it’s like two sentences are trying to come out at once, and people can’t understand me. I’m so shy and afraid around people. 

Not to mention I’m going nowhere in life. I’m just sort of breathing until the day I can’t anymore."

And so here I am, worthless damn loser, drinking alone once again. Cause I’m a goddamn failure. A miserable alcoholic. Just like my worthless, piece of shit father. I’d tell myself it’s genetic, but I don’t deserve to give myself an easy out. Definitely feels like there’s poison in my veins instead of blood though. Or a think black tar, oozing through my heart like a damn sickness. Hope it’s terminal. I’ll raise a fucking glass to that…"

It’s my fault for thinking anything I wanted mattered. All odds are against me so it’s all rather worthless in the end. I just can’t wait until I finally get fed up and decide to not alive. I’m so sick of being a push over. I’m so sick of being a nobody. No one cares about me. I am a nobody. I want to disappear. I will soon. But I don’t know when or how.

Mr_washi_washi,2021-09-14 08:13:07+00:00,How do people live a happy and comfortable life knowing it will come to an end no matter what?,"how do they have these long term goals like going to school for 8 years to become a doctor and starting a family? I find literally everything in life pointless and meaningless besides short term pleasure like alcohol or some sort of adrenaline rush. I actually stopped drinking regularly because I hated the way hangovers feel and couldn’t take them anymore. Now I rarely drink. Every 1-3 months maybe. and let me tell you, life has gotten twice as dull and boring since I made the change. I have the energy to do things, just no drive."
R3belLeader,2021-09-14 06:49:02+00:00,I am Alone.,"The worst part about the title to this post is: it is a lie. I have friends, I have a wife, I have some family members I don't avoid. By any and all observations made about my life one could see that I am not alone. Yet with every problem that comes up in my life I do not look around for help. There is something inside me that is convinced that I am alone, that no one cares, and no one will. I have been diagnosed with depression officially for a few years now but I've been living with it all my life. I'm 27 Years old and I'm so tired of hope. Hope that this will change, hope that things will get better, Hope that I will get better. Because having hope ripped away from me by the crushing weight of reality is one of the worst pains I have ever experienced. I have an iron resolve against suicide to the point where I don't really worry about it any more but my wife thinks that means I don't think about it. She's wrong. I think about it almost daily. Never as a solution just how convenient it could be. I hate so much about the way that I am that I do believe those closest to me would be better off. My wife would find a better husband, My son would have a better man as his father, my friends wouldn't have to worry about giving me the pats on the back to keep going. My burden on this world would only exist in memory and to be honest no other idea gives me more peace. I don't say these things for a response, in-fact I probably will not check the comments. I say this because maybe somewhere in this subreddit there are a few people that understand. Maybe there are people who can read this and relate to what I've written. If you're reading this and that's you, I am terribly sorry. You are in an un-enviable position and I hope something or someone comes that breaks this toxic cycle we are trapped in. The idea that there are more people like me, however, does help. The idea that I'm not alone, not the only average Joe with this psychosis makes me feel a little less crazy, a little less broken, and a little less hopeless."
noosesclub,2021-09-14 06:23:27+00:00,how do you define life?,"I was diagnosed with severe depression last year of March. But I have been suffering overwhelming emotions that made it hard to make decisions since I was a freshman in high school. Before I was diagnosed I tried my best to develop myself and character for the better. But I always end up called selfish and an asshole because I always just think about myself. I might be a typical depressed teenager but I don't really know what that means. I stopped taking medication after May of last year because of my overdose incident. I never wanted to attempt suicide but I have suicidal thoughts. But when I just think about the purpose of life, I never really thought about the answer. But I think that's the reason I'm woke and alive. because I don't want to leave the world without finding the reason to be in it. 

IMO I believe that when we have questions about the world it's not about finding the answers. But finding the right questions to ask. IMO I don't think I'll ever find my purpose or the in general what everyone's purpose is. I think our purpose is to wander.

I'm looking for your opinions. I don't want any debates, but an open discussion. What do you guys think the definition of life is? What keeps you woke and alive regardless of being mentally ill? I'd love to hear it and learn something."

Holy shit, there's so much I'm trying to do but this pain is so distracting.

I'm a mess, I don't even know what time or day it is. The insomnias a bitch. The mornings and nights all becoming one, morphing into one never ending day."
altier14,2021-09-14 05:24:27+00:00,a rant about my life," i hate life so much. i have no friends (which im fine with) but it's true that i do wish sometimes i have someone to talk/rant to. But the main reason why i'm ranting right now, is because of my household and my life. i live in such a shitty household. i live with my mom, dad, 2 sisters, and grandma and grandpa. everyone in the house are such jerks most of the time. My mom loves wasting money and being a jerk, My dad always thinks he's right, and when he gets mad he can't help but yell, one of my sisters (who's around 20) is home all day doing absolutely nothing, and when it's time to talk to someone/hang out with family, she starts complaining til she gets her way. and my other sister (who is almost 20) who's always out is the same way when it comes to talking to family members. My grandma is a frickn psychopath, she yells and whines when she's mad or dosen't get what she fucking wants, and tells other people they're ""lazy"" even though she always asks other family members to get her phone charger when she dosen't have it next to her. my grandpa is fine for the most part, he's never really home since he's at work most of the time, but when he is home he's kind, asks me how im doing, he can also be a jerk sometimes but he's defiantly the lesser jerk. then you have me, a 14 year old boy who just started high school., i know i said that one of my sisters don't do anything at home, but im really the same. all i really do is scout the internet, watch movies and tv shows, play video games, you know, what a 14 year old boy would do in this day n age. i also have 2 cats who are always there for me. i also forgot to mention that we also live with my uncle, who has autism and can't speak proper english, or any language at all. now i obviously don't blame anyone for this, but my uncle is always yelling as well, because like i said, he has autism. no matter what time of the day, he's never quiet. it doesn't help that i can always hear him in my room, there's nothing like trying to sleep and day dream and hearing screaming. and whenever my uncle dosen't quiet, my grandma starts yelling at him, even if he doesn't understand a single thing she's saying. i can go on and on about my household, but what about my life other than house? well....nothing. i'm always home. i don't have any friends so i don't go out with anyone or talk to anyone. I've always been the loner, laughing stock of all classes i've been in, i've always been that weird loner nerd kid who was into a lot of stuff that other people weren't, and i still am that way. i always got made fun of, even if a classmate rarely knew me they would just go ahead and make fun of, and then this caused me to have anxiety talking to other people, more specifically classmates. if i was gonna be made fun of and criticized from anyone, then of course im scared when talking to people now, that anxiety goes well with the anxiety i already had when going to school. i never insulted anyone, i never hurt anyone, i rarely talked, but people always think they're better than everyone else. it pretty much stopped in grade 8, since in grade 8 i was doing online school. nobody could make fun of how i looked, or how i talked, i could just be myself. but then some old bullies tried to be friends with me. they said i was ""cool"" for liking the stuff i liked, the stuff i was mainly known for, which one of those things was Anime. i was always huge on it, and i was always clowned on by those same guys, and now since anime is considered a trend, they now ""like"" anime and wanted to be friends me just because of my huge knowledge of it. but they still treated me like shit, they even never listened to me. one of them asked me for recommendations, i tell them what to watch, but they dont watch it until one their friends does, it literally took one of them half a year to watch a certain anime that i recommended. i also friended this girl from my online class at the start of school, she seemed like me, she was nice and liked stuff i liked as well. I thought to myself that she was the one, the one to be my best friend, we got along so well, but then she started acting like a jerk to me, what a surprise.. i was tired of this, so i unfriended all of them and deleted my discord. why can't i have someone who generally cares about me? someone i can share my every thought to without making fun of me? why do i have this life? im just so sick and tired of living, you could say ""you're only 14 you have so much to live for"" but how do you know that? i'm already a failure as it is, having horrible grades, doesn't have anyone who cares for me, etc. all i have to live for in the future is what i'm feeling now, im trying as hard as i can to get through everything, but man, life just sucks. if you read all of this, thank you. i doubt anyone will though, im just a 14 year old on reddit, it's not like my problems actually matter"
ArachnidInteresting,2021-09-14 05:00:30+00:00,I keep trying,"I keep trying to live and it’s getting harder day by day, I went off my meds only because it just didn’t fully help, I feel more alone than ever and used up. It’s like staring at a blank wall everyday of my life every change I try to make it doesn’t even make a different I was admitted to the mental hospital because I was going to kill myself but I didn’t. I wish I could go back so I could of. I took Prozac 60mg about 15 of them and somehow woke up, I took Advil pills and woke up I been feeling depression sick and I’m just at this point giving up, I keep hoping something would happen. But I don’t think anyone cares anymore. My best friend who’s my ex doesn’t care I think he’s using me at this point. I’m an idiot for letting him because he’s my comfort and safe spot. But at the same time because of him I have trust issues and stay more and more isolated. It’s hard to continue."

But I just want the pain to stop, it’s been eating at me for years but I believe it’s reaching its peak. I’m scared for myself. I just want it all to go away. Feeling the need to harm or like just thinking of ways I can off myself but I develop a fear. I quit eating and when I do eat, I feel like throwing it up. I stopped drawing, I fake a smile but still try to aid everyone before myself. And I don’t even know why, I lack care for myself. Blame myself for everything. I just want to wake up from this nightmare. 

I miss being a kid, if I knew where I’d be now, I’d prolly have ended it a long time ago during my first attempt. I’m tired of the constant pain, chugging energy drinks and feeling like everyone secretly is using me or hates me."

Once in a great while, i'll get a burst of peace from it, but overall, my stupid fucking brain goes back to misery.

Is life worth living if 99% of the time you're in a realm of constant emotional agony?

The only reason I'm still alive is because of a promise to my bestfriend and my pets.

Other than that, I have no reason to keep going. I don't think it'll ever get better for me. Not a romantic partner, not good grades, not a great career. It's just constant agony.

Ok_Helicopter6138,2021-09-13 22:03:39+00:00,Just an update for those interested,"I posted here about 90 days ago and since then everything has gone to hell. My GF who was the only thing keeping me from falling back in this deep void, broke up with me about 70 days ago and she got a new guy basically right away and I can’t deal with that. It’s like what we went through and the times we had together just vanished it’s like it never happened, like there was never anything related to love at least from her side. I just know that I haven’t cried since and I haven’t cried for about 2 years before that, but I just couldn’t control it anymore, I was drinking on my holiday and it all came flooding out. I can’t remember a thing, I just know I started sobbing uncontrollably and then it’s gone. I was told I cried so hard some people I meet there were worrying about me not being able to breathe.

And since then I have felt like shit. I don’t know what to do. I keep up my facade when I am not alone but I start to crack. This facade is breaking down and people start to notice my depression. But I don’t want that. I am scared of losing everything that I have left. I couldn’t deal with that. My mental state is declining and my psyche is starting to break apart. Life is a fucking drag. I just feel like ending it all but I am to afraid off death. I basically have nothing left and I am scared of losing that nothing. I still have people I know who rarely speak with me but I might lose that. I just really want to die, but I don’t have the courage to go through with it. I cut myself more and more and deeper and deeper. I am scared, confused, broken and suicidal."

WasteOfOrganicMatter,2021-09-13 18:25:29+00:00,Screaming into the void. I am not okay.,"I'm so tired. Tired of things being the way they are, tired of my inability to change. Tired of the fact that I recognize all of the things that are wrong, from the cognitive distortions down to the chemical imbalances that change my mood, but I don't want to fix them. Maybe I like being unhappy. Perhaps I feel like I deserve it for any of the things I've done before. 

I'm disgusted by myself in so many ways. Physically, emotionally, psychologically. I'm such a fundamentally flawed human being that its laughable. There are so many daily reminders of my own inadequacies. I can hardly stand it anymore. The most frustrating part about it its feeling like there is nothing I can do to address it. 

I'm not looking for advice, so please don't offer any. If there's one thing I'm looking for it's a person that I could talk to about sincerely and genuinely about my feelings without them telling me that I was wrong because my unhappiness somehow makes them uncomfortable. 

At least here, people don't lie to me to make themselves feel better. I'm fat, unattractive, abrasive and unintelligent. These are all things I've been told by people in various communities and ya know what? I actually appreciate the honesty, as opposed to people trying to convince me that my feelings aren't valid and I'm wrong."

I really had the urge, it was overwhelming whilst i held the broken glass to my skin.

Though i had a strong urge, i didn’t do it. I never have self harmed and i would like to think that i wouldn’t do it, but these urges take over you. I’m afraid i’m going to hurt myself even though i know it’s wrong. I’m just fascinated at the thought of doing so because my thoughts push me to.

Ever since that day, it’s all i can think about. Simply just hurting myself. My dog scratches me and makes scars on my arm and it makes me want to do some myself. I don’t have a therapist nor a counselor, and honestly i’m afraid. How do i stop this? I know it isn’t the right thing to do but the urges get stronger everyday."

So instead of people seeing how I really look, they see what happened to me and assume it's how I naturally look.

I wear a mask 24/7 so much that I don't even know if I actually exist, if there is actualy someone underneath. I don't have enough strength left to keep it on. I look like a zombie.

Yesterday I saw a video of myself 20 years ago. I was 18 or 19. I was so beautiful, full of long hair. I looked like Keanu Reeves. Now I'm bald and don't look anything remotely close to how I see myself in my dreams. I miss my youth. I had so much potential. I screw everything up because I never knew who I was. Now it's too late to do anything about it.

Tired of waking up every morning wishing I was dead. TIred all the time. Asking for help but nobody listens or takes me seriously. I can't get better. No professional help available. Waiting lists that last for years just to see a doctor or a therapist. I don't even believe in therapy.

Regret every decision I ever made. Built my own cage I can't get out of. I could, but that would piss everyone off and hurt so many people I couldn't live with the guilt. Can't even talk about that here in details otherwise I'll get verbally abused (speaking from experience).

I'm a piece of shit selfish bastard and I don't deserve anything good. I wish I could just end it but I can't. I really hope that growth on my balls is cancer coming to kill me."

Moraes90Bam,2021-09-13 13:01:58+00:00,i hate my fucking life.,"i don’t even know why i’m writing this. it’s more for myself kind of thing i guess. i hate my life.

i hate my life because i hate m body, i don’t believe i’m body dysmorphic, i just really hate not having a normal male body. i’m 5ft 6 barely and i have tiny hands, 6.8 inches to be exact. woman hands i know. it’s absolutely ridiculous how many girls reject me not just because of my height but my hands too!
i constantly get ridiculed for the size of them by my ‘friends’ and they all tower over me i don’t fit in with them and because i don’t fit in im an easy target i guess. 

i got kicked out of school for a stupid fight and didn’t get any good grades (as you can tell by my terrible english) and im supposed to be going to college soon. my parent (single mother) who works really hard wants me to go but i just do not want to do it. why? im just not happy.

i wanted to do martial arts as it’s something i enjoy even maybe take it pro. but my body doesn’t exactly allow it, my wrists are built like turkeys and will snap if i try to punch hard and my hands aren’t big enough to pack that powerful blow an mma fighter needs.

i feel like im just living to die at this point and the only thing i’ve got left to do is be depressed with myself and just genuinely unhappy. 

i sound like such a complainer but i really do not complain a lot. not at all to be quite honest. 

i feel empty and lost and the happy boy i was 7 years ago is long gone. i just can’t accept that my body is like half woman and half man i hate not being able to date because women’s hands are bigger than mine or they want an average sized male. 

i just really really want to die i just can’t bring myself to it. ive tried killing myself before but i can never pull it off. even killing myself is something im not capable of im a failure to my sweet hard working mom.

and yeah my girlfriend left me for a 6ft 3 big dude that’s clearly better than i am. people will say it gets better and don’t compare yourself to others but how can i not? im the fucking loser that can’t even kill myself. it doesn’t get better not for me anyway it’s been 1 year now and im still not over her. ive tried doctors, therapy all sorts and nothing works.

Well things got really good I was gaining confidence and being more social. Then bam I started to talk to great girl that actually wants to treat me right which is something I have never experienced. Things are still going great BUT today of course depression kicked telling me i don't deserve any of this and shit is going to go down. Every fucking time without fail I have to fight myself when things go well. It's been 3 years since I have felt happy and honestly probably the first time i started feeling better about myself. Sorry to be bitching about this especially when i have seen way more serious problems that others are experiencing... I just need to unload to others that I don't know. If you read this thank you for enduring this and I genuinely hope for the best for everyone on here.

Not when good. Just okay."
Polymath360,2021-09-13 06:30:26+00:00,"At The End of My Rope, Waiting For Interview Process","I'm 25, turning 26 on Christmas. College educated, tall, and handsome (according to my ex-gfs and women who aren't related to me). I've been suffering from anxiety, autism, and treatment-resistant depression for almost all my life. I've been bullied since childhood (by my peers and parents) for being autistic and bisexual.

This year, for the first time in my life, I had everything I ever wanted. I lived alone in another state and enjoyed peace and quiet while working from home as a digital marketer. I'm not able to drive because of seizure risks so I was so grateful not to have to commute to work.

But the joy was short-lived as my boss suddenly called after investors pulled out.

In short, I was laid off from my dream job a few days ago and now I'm in constant anxiety over the financial trajectory of the next few months. I only have 2 months worth of savings and no family to turn to. I told a few friends from college about my situation, but it seems that they're dealing with their own demons so I don't want to be a burden on them.

My parents had me by accident. My (able-bodied) dad got away with not working for almost my whole life while my mom worked a minimum wage janitor position at a school for the same amount of time. My dad's reason for not working (he graduated medical school) was that if he worked, he would lose all his government benefits. He would just spend all day watching game shows and Asian dramas. How he got away with this, I will never know.

My mom and I had no choice but to comply because he would get violent and give one of his famous Section 8 sermons. My mom often took her anger out on me, but I didn't talk back because I knew she was suffering because my dad was a lazy piece of s\*\*\*.

If I don't get a job within 2 months, I am going to take that final sleep and finally have peace.

My resume is always polished because I interned as a Resume Editor during college. I graduated with honors in Digital Marketing. The only challenge is the job interview because of my disability working against me.

So I have an interview with a company I like on Friday. I'm hoping to summon all the remaining energy I have left to act like one of those extroverted, yet incompetent idiots who seem to easily get jobs.

And yes, I've tried seeking professional help - three psychiatrists and three psychologists to be exact. I've failed three trials of medication. There is literally nothing keeping me here except for the chance that I might get the job and not get evicted.

I'm only 25, but it feels like I've been living for centuries because of the compounded effects of trauma.

I think I deserve a break if things go completely down the hill. Mathematically, the odds are against me."
erasemyheart,2021-09-13 06:18:48+00:00,I can't continue on this way but I can't go back,"Hey all.  I've been fighting depression since I was a teen (now 40enby), and I feel like I'm only getting worse rapidly.
I call it the black or the void, because that's what it feels like.  Black, empty, devoid of any hope, joy, or good feeling.  Color is drained from the world, and it feels like drowning in vacuum.
There are more and more days where I am moments from crying, or have a face full of tears.
I can't stop feeling heartbroken and hopeless and a deep sense of loss.  I feel like my mind fills in the gaps, and just plays every mistake, every break, every person lost, every helpless situation on repeat, saying ""These are why you feel this way, and why you deserve this void"".
My psychs have so far kept me on the same meds I was on at 18.
The only way to fight back the darkness, just for a little while, is to find something to busy myself with or substances.
I can't keep on feeling this way, but I don't know how to fix myself.  Maybe I can't be fixed."

-0Z0-,2021-09-13 02:28:26+00:00,I want to dream forever.,"As a child I used to be scared of going to bed so I never wanted, I made up a thousand excuses to my parents to they would allow me to stay awake juat a little longer. Those times were different you were young and stupid incapable to understand that the sleep was actually good for you. But when you were in your bed and your eyes closed you would experience the most amazing dreams. Worlds made out of you imagination, it was beautiful.

As I aged I started to understand the importance of a good sleep. I still hated going to bed feeling like it was a waste of precious time, I'd rather game or watch TV and so I did in secret. It was a thrill to do it as my parents would always check whether I was wasting ""precious"" bed time or not. But when I slept I would dream again, I dreamt about a future me, I had ambitions and plans for when I grew up.

A couple years later I started to see the world in a negative way, loneliness, anxiety and fealures all deprived me of my happiness. Until nothing was left. Just this feeling of nothingness trying to fill a void.

Now I was tired but couldn't sleep, all that I loved, all the emotions I could express and all my ambitions had vanished. Except my humor which is famously a mask to hide everything underneath. And tiredness which seems to keep me awake at night.

I no longer have good nights, a thousand thoughts keep me awake.

I wish I could sleep like a younger me again. 
And dream forever. I want to dream forever."

We both told each other that we still love each other very much and would do everything to not make this go away, but I’m struggling really hard with this, especially because I don’t feel like I’m good enough for her. I tell her that I’m feeling not good or something and she tries to make me happy but I have the feeling of not making her happy enough and complaining too much about my bad feelings.

There was this group of people I was seeing, until dec2020, in the same time classes went online.
Being who I am and being scared of getting helped I dropped everything in Jan2020, thinking I was just too weak to continue.

from Jan to Jun2020 it's like a void, I isolated myself, it was a really long period yet I can't remember tf of what I did there. 

Now I'm feeling better, but that makes me realize what happened to me the past year.
I was just paralysed by that, it made me think it was all me, but in the end I could have done it if I had just asked to be helped.

Right now I'm in a train, starting something else this year but went backward. And I just look up and think that exactly one year passed, and nothing happened. I feel like I should be somewhere else. It feels like everything I did the past two years happened in my head."

I have been sober for a week. Been going to the gym. But there still seems that I am alone. I have no friends to talk to. I am taking care of my 3 month old puppy, and I still have a job.

Every night for an unknown reason I start to cry but I hold my tears back because there's no reason for me to cry at all.

Express_Classroom_37,2021-09-12 17:48:20+00:00,Feels like I’m braindead,"
Hey,

I was a rather intelligent individual due to the fact that I was able to achieve an IQ of 140 on the Mensa test. From the grades I got in high school I also got admitted to Cs and engineering at a good university and that’s what I’ve been studying now for about 3 weeks.

But for months, I’ve been feeling that my brain function and my mental reasoning ability has decreased drastically. I am now struggling with math problems that I used to ace in high school, and I have a hard time learning and especially remembering things even though I study a lot. This is taking a toll on me! My memory has worsen significantly to the point that I need to write things down in order to remember it. I even need to search up simple words because I have either forgotten what the word actually was, how to spell it or the meaning of the word. And this happens every single day. 

My depression comes in waves and when it was really fucking bad (couple months ago) I was going insane. It has now calmed down a bit and I have absolutely no clue if my symptoms are caused by my depression or if there is a hidden underlying condition that I don’t know about.


Has anyone experienced this?"

I have to rely on my husband to help me and my son. Even then we are still broke.MIL used my social security for food stamp fraud and almost got me sent to prison. I would have been taken away from my newborn. MIL lies about it and husband is completely up her ass kissing it. My parents mentally abused me because I want everyone to be vaccinated around my son. My refrigerator is broke. Apartment people fixed  it, it broke 3 days later. There are still bugs and water at the bottom of it. Husband has no documents so I am very limited in life. I have to drive everywhere, he has a hard time finding a job and is always at risk. Husband is undocumented so my apartment is in mine and my dads name. (Yikes) My apartment is messy, I’m too tired because I have a newborn. It’s hard to find time to eat and clean (including myself). I’m concerned my car will break soon.My Medicaid will end soon (can’t get it again because husband is undocumented).I’m fat, ugly, and gross (probably why husband cheated on me). My body is ruined.

I just want to be left alone forever to die and rot myself for the most part now. I would consider suicide except that I dont want to die any more than I want to continue living a fucking miserable and meaningless life. ""What dreams may come"" and all that; Remember what it was like before you were born? Exactly. 

Everything is just so fucking ridiculous all the time and I can barely stand social interaction anymore, all I feel is emptiness or generalized anger and irritability. I've resurrected a daily marijuana habit but that doesn't even make me feel good anymore just momentarily less miserable, hence daily, in fact I  don't fucking see anything good in the world and life consists mostly of having to thwart the next fucking asshole around the next fucking corner who is trying to scam you.

Bitter_Possible1860,2021-09-12 13:48:36+00:00,Realization of composed depression,"    I came to a realization a few weeks back. I have no expectations left after roughly 17 (I’m 29) years of living with depression. I am actively contemplating and planning the day of my death. The scary part is that before when I thought about it I’d get the weird feeling as if shit it’s coming to this. Akin to watching the climax or ending of a movie or show. This is unbearable. I tried to get out there and try to be “normal” but nothing I do clicks the right way. And I get the feeling that people around can tell just messed up I am. Hard as I try I can’t seem to connect with anyone. Even my family seem so far away now. And it’s not like I can tell anyone the shame is enough to make me choke when I even think of telling a soup.
I have a countdown ticking away to the day that I plan to kill myself, actually I still have 7793 days to go (21 years give or take). But like I said the last few weeks especially today or rather yesterday I’m at a crossroads. A sense of finality to my story. Like any day now or I need is a good excuse. It’s not normal. Not healthy, I get that I am sick, I understand how my friends and family might feel afterwards too. I think I am rational enough to comprehend that. But I pulling at straws as of now.
The world looks bleak, the future, present and to an extent my past are weighting down on my soul suffocating me. I used to have many friends and a close relationship with my family but now it’s like I am not the same guy I was before. Or rather the guy that I am now was just the real me without them around. Don’t know honestly. 
As of right now I just don’t have the means to end myself painlessly(yeah I’m a coward who doesn’t wanna feel pain). But I am close to procuring the things to do it. The only reason I’m even putting this here is to hopefully get that oh damn moment or putting it into words for the world to see might alíviate my pain. I don’t know what else to do at this point. Sometimes I even fantasize of getting an incurable (I know it’s wrong and messed up) because hopefully it’ll get this weight from my chest and let me go in on a more understandable way. 
The way I want to not let anyone in my family ever go through my shit. It’s not fair, for them.
Either way if you read this far thanks. I don’t wish these kind of thoughts on anyone sorry as well."

The issue is that we are both married to different people, we spend a lot fo time together at work and also outside of work. she has become my best friend, we talk and text all the time. I suspect that she may at one time also may have formed feelings not sure. what do I do? do I tell her or  just live with this? I would hate to lose her as a friend but this has been eating me up inside"
MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-12 11:05:34+00:00,What are you supposed to do when you don’t have a purpose and nothing means anything to you?,"I’m empty. Just completely hollow. Feels like I’m already dead, just waiting for my body to catch up. I can’t think of a single reason I’m still here. And yet here I am. Just existing for existences’ sake. Why haven’t I killed myself yet? I dunno. Guess I’m waiting for a sudden burst of energy or determination or something. Don’t even have the motivation to kill myself. How much more useless could be?

I’ve tried asking the question before, about what you’re supposed to do when you’re terminally nihilistic, and everyone seemed to just say the same sorta thing. “It’s actually freeing cause you get to pick your own purpose” or something along those lines. Just doesn’t feel like a positive to me. Nothing matters to me. Seriously, nothing. How the hell are you supposed to pick a purpose for yourself when everything is pointless?

All the suggestions I’ve heard for a potential purpose, they’re just nothing to me. Helping people? Guess I’m a selfish asshole, cause it doesn’t make me feel anything, I don’t care about other people. Work? Don’t have a career or a passion or even a goddamn job because I can’t hold one for more than 3 months. Family and friends? Hah, good one. There’s just nothing.

And the other suggestion I get is some variation of “you gotta live for the little thing that make you happy”. Well I don’t have those either. Nothing makes me happy. Some people say food, but that doesn’t work for me cause I’ve got a history of anorexia, so eating shit I enjoy stresses me out too much for it to be worth it. Hobbies, games, movies, books, songs? Never found one that I enjoyed enough to balance out all the shitty parts of life, best I can say is that they waste time. But is that all we’re doing here passing the time just to pass the time? That doesn’t appeal to me at all.

Hell, I think I’m even past the point where my vices will do it. Thought for sure I was gonna break my 4 month sober streak last night, or self harm or something. But I just didn’t see the point of even doing that. It’s just there to make watching the time tick away more bearable. But what’s the point of passing the time quicker? Only thing I’m waiting for is to die one day. What’s the point of living out the middle bit? Hope? Doesn’t there have to be something you’re hoping *for* for that concept to work? I don’t care about anything enough to hope for it. So I’ve got none. Probably still will start drinking again at some point, considering I’m stuck waiting for whatever it is I’m waiting for to finally finish myself off. Doesn’t fucking matter anyway.

Just don’t know what someone like me is supposed to do. Therapy doesn’t do anything. I’ve been in it for years, had all different therapists, tried a bunch of different types. Nothing. Dozens upon dozens of medications. Nothing. Psychedelics? Tried ‘em, hated everything about them. Anything else I can’t afford cause I’m stuck in the same old catch-22, can’t hold a job till I get treatment, can’t get treatment till I can hold a job. Not sure I’d even bother wasting the money at this point anyway, it’s not like these “professionals” have been any help before now. 

It’s not a phase either, cause I know someone’s gonna say it. I’ve been in those up and down phases, I know what they’re like. I’ve been slowly deteriorating for 2 years. There’s been no ups in that time. It’s just down and down and down, further into the goddamn pit. 

Realised that I don’t even know why I’m posting this but I guess I’ve already typed the whole damn thing out anyway."

Kitty_94,2021-09-11 20:41:05+00:00,Why can I never hit the nail on the head with my therapist?,"I was in a very dark place in January and decided it was time to finally at 26 start trying to piece my mental health back together. I've been seeing a therapist since who has helped with a lot. getting into internal family systems, working towards loving myself, and feeling connected to others. 

I still feel so disconnected from everyone in my life, especially this last week which has been a rough depressive episode that I hope ends soon. I feel like I should have a better connection with family but I cannot seem to let the past go and I know that there will never be a chance to lay everything out on the table with them without creating new wounds. 

I feel like I'm in such a rut just trying to finish school like it will magically solve all my problems. I want to run away. 

I can't ever get at the heart of my problems though and I feel like my last 3 sessions with my therapist have been just me talking in circles about how I want to connect, but I don't want to connect, and how I try to accept where I'm at with people, but I just feel like I'm never actually discussing what Is actually bothering me. I don't know what is actually bothering me though and I don't know how to ask the right questions. 

I've been on the brink of tears and rage and I don't know what to do about it. I'm so stuck and have no one I can really talk to. Not that I don't have someone that would listen, but I don't want to burden people with my problems. 

Everything aches. I have no energy. I want something and I don't know what it is."

I feel like I'm ruining my life worse and worse every decision I make. From my family not wanting me because I'm gay to my girlfriend I'm living with cheating on me to struggling as a self employed online business owner to needing to buy a vehicle with credit that's low because all my cards are low amounts and maxed out. 
My life is a disaster. My girlfriend is cheating on me and we live together. If I say something, I'll get kicked out because tho I'm paying the rent, my name isn't on the property/lease. So I'm just sitting here watching it happen. I hate when she kisses me because she thinks I don't see her texting the guy 24/7. She's supposedly ""gay"" but I guess that was one of her million lies too.
So here I am, I need a new vehicle. Mine won't run. It's not even worth $100.  I don't have great credit and I don't know if I'll be able to get a decent vehicle. 1 because I'm self employed and I don't have enough information on paper where I've only been doing this business for a year. 2 The car market is insane. 
She's the only person in my life. I'm autistic and suck at communicating so I've never had many friends. My family isn't in my life. It's just a tough spot to be in. I moved to this town in January and it's been downhill ever since. I'm hustling hard as I possibly can. Working all day and most nights 7 days a week."

I feel guilty and like I wasted so much time and their money. I’ve been living at home while trying to find a job, but unfortunately I have been unsuccessful. Even when I apply to retail and restaurants I am often told that I’m over qualified and turned down but do not have enough experience for most research positions. I feel like I’ve been going in a circle for months and at this point I’m emotionally and physically exhausted. Anytime I try to take a moment to relax and gather my thoughts my parents accuse me of not trying hard enough and recently have begun calling me a whore and other things even though I haven’t dated or been in a relationship in over 2 years.

Jma3rd,2021-09-11 12:02:54+00:00,My life is a mess.,"I am laying here on my bed and I have been trying to sleep all night long but can't.   The sun is now coming up here.  I closed  my eyes, tried several different things actually but I couldn't get any sleep.  I have several different issues, and I don't know what to do.  The only thing I do know is that I don't want to kill myself, even though part of me wishes I could go to sleep and not wake up.  I am hurting very badly on the inside.  It is not a health issue,  though I have plenty of those as well.  The best way to explain it and hopefully venting it here will get this off my chest.  September 11th is not only a day of national tragedy, but several years after that, my business, my home, and almost all of my possessions were destroyed in a fire.  Fortunately I was not home at the time, but I lost an incredible amount back then.  And the people of the town came out to watch and treated it like a bond fire almost.  There were crowds of people that came to watch, laugh,  and have a big time, while I was in pain.  My whole family was.  I am still hurt by those events to this day.  So that is my first issue.  The second is because of my health issues, I recently suffered a partial amputation of my right foot.  Basically I lost my toes and the front of my foot.  So I have had to stay off my foot and on bed rest for the several weeks with at least one more week to go.  Third, I got a letter in the mail telling me that my disability claim was denied by social security because they determined that I can actually work, even though they haven't actually had a doctor examine me, just someone look over my medical records.  I am sure we will attempt  to appeal the decision.  The thing is, if I could find a job that I am capable of doing, I could make so much more money than disability would pay.  I could have a way better lifestyle and actually afford insurance to cover my medical bills.  Right now I am forced to live in poverty and beg for food and help.  I can't pay my medical bills and can't qualify for Medicaid because I am not on disability and don't meet their requirements. With the government I am truly better off dead because they are not willing to help.  I don't know what I am going to do.  If I weren't a Christian, and I wasn't afraid of failing at it, I would attempt to commit suicide. You see I am a 49 year old fat white man that is single and never married.  I had a few girlfriends, but never found one that was serious enough to want to spend the rest of our lives together.  And I believe marriage is exactly that.  I didn't want to believe in divorce.  Anyway because of my health issues and the fact that I am a big guy and can't live by myself, I was forced to live with my parents which also doesn't help my self esteem.  I am thankful that I still have them and they help me out, but I went from having to take care of myself on my own, to needing someone to help take care of me.  I really don't know what I am going to do.  All I can say is that my life is a real mess.  I don't know what advice or help anyone can give me.  But I needed to tell someone somewhere that I  am not ok, and I truly want to scream.  I wish that I could sleep, I also wish that I could just die and be done with this.  But I don't think that will happen any time soon.  Thanks for reading."

throwaway77992,2021-09-11 08:38:00+00:00,Everything that’s making me sad.,"I (f19) have no friends. Everyone left and ignored me in the end. Even after crying for help, they all ignored me. 

I have one online friend but he wouldn’t have been my friend if it wasn’t for sexting. We’ve been friends for almost a year and he seems to be losing interest a lot and isn’t appreciative much but I can’t blame him either since we’re just friends. He used to be caring and kind but just got distant.

Im ugly and people have reminded me countless times that I am. All I’m good for is my body. People I thought genuinely liked me ended up manipulating me into sex early on. No one has ever had a crush/liked me or found me attractive. I’ve never been called beautiful or pretty.

I have been sexually abused by my own sibling when I was 10 and again a few months ago. But nothing was ever done about it and I have no support system, I even still live with him. I have a lot of trauma and problems handling my emotions. 

Everyone I have tried opening up about the abuse always made me feel like I’m overreacting and seeking for attention. And I now believe it. I feel so invalidated. 

No one listens to me and lets me have any sort of emotions. My mom found out that I was cutting myself once (when i was 17) and she forced me to open up about my problems, only to end up saying that all my problems were stupid.

I have tried looking for help online through counseling but I was left on read and ignored. I told my school counselor but he, too, ended up ignoring my problems and didn’t help me at all. 

I feel so alone and stuck. I don’t know what to do. I have dreams and goals but it all feels pointless and I feel empty now.

I feel like all I’m good for is my body. And it’s all I’m worth. Being used and dumped. I have been told to kill myself by my own friend and teacher in high school when they found out I was cutting myself. A few friends made fun of the cuts and told me to do it properly and “nicely”. I tried seeking for help (when I was 17) from a different teacher that I’ve known since I was 13, but he ignored me completely. 

An ex friend of mine who was the only person I’ve ever personally told about the abuse (when I was 13) , told the whole school about it and he even told my abuser recently. Both of them teamed up and wanted to ruin my life. Ex friend believed my abuser when he said i was lying and made it all up. Called me all sorts of disgusting names and wanted to post it all over social media. When he (ex friend) told my mom, she “thanked” him. She said it was a way to manipulate him to stop harassing me but it probably just enabled his behaviors more. 

My dad (divorced and remarried) doesn’t care about me. He never bothered to call or ask how I was after the abuse. My grandmother told me the abuse is normal and common and that I should just forgive him for the sake of the family.

I’m so tired of everything and I just want to disappear. I want to be alone. But I can’t. I hate myself so much. My whole body and face is ugly and I have nothing worth living for. I’m just trash and there’s really nothing for me.

I don’t want to be here anymore"

I'm getting that feeling when it's like life is moving on without you and it's bullshit because I'm being robbed of mine. Getting sick of it and just looking for a real person to talk to for a minute or more.

What I hate about this is that my life has been fucked up and my self esteem hella destroyed by people who suck. I don't know how I let it happened but it's too late now, maybe. It's just really dumb that they messed with me and I didn't get out of that circle sooner. 

It's not entirely their fault but some of them are really shitty people to the point that it's creepy af. They have this devotion to the idea of being shitty is funny. Which I don't think is inherently true so I'm pissed. But what can I do now? Post on a subreddit no one reads."
Alarming_Extension47,2021-09-11 05:46:03+00:00,Lost at 25,"Sometimes I wish I could delete my life and start over. This time last year I was engaged and on the verge of becoming a wife and mother. My fiancé came out as transgender (mtf) which ended our relationship. I’m a cis woman who is more sexually attracted to women, but not romantically.  Nine months later I live alone in my one bedroom apartment, with little to no success finding a guy to stay longer than a month. Online dating is where I met my ex and when I was a 20 year old that couldn’t drive and lived with my parents, everyone wanted to date me. Now that I’m 25 and actually have stuff to my name, I hear crickets from men. It’s all “I’m not looking for a relationship” or “I don’t want kids”. Sometimes I feel happy and independent, other times I’m lonely and I think I’ll never find love again. I’m on antidepressants but I still feel gross in my own skin. I see people seeming happily married with children on the way, and I just want to run away from it all. I know we don’t always get what we want but I was so close to it. I could never take my own life, so the alternative is to just keep moving and keep looking for love.

_SapphireBlue_,2021-09-11 03:36:57+00:00,"My X husband has custody of my son, it's unfair and I can't keep living in this kind of pain","When X husband and I divorced, I left on the basis of abuse. He is extremely wealthy, I was a house wife. 

I was emotionally beaten down and I had to agree to a host of divorce clauses, such as a psychiatric clause that stated if I was to see my son I had to be under the care of a psychologist and seek therapy. I don't and never had any severe psychiatric mental problems like bi polar depression, schizophrenia, no substance abuse disorders... nothing. 

The most unfair was the custody arrangement which I agreed to under duress, days of emotional attacks, screaming at me in our shared home where I caved and agreed to him having 60% custody. In later court hearings I told the judge I didn't want this, that my x husband was bullying me into typing this and that (at the time) I didn't know emails, texts, and things were admissible in court. I didn't have enough money to fight it. My credit cards I put the divorce on were maxed out. 

The point is

Come Covid 19 of last year, my x husband began using social distancing to separate me from my son over my x husband's father who is elderly. That me seeing my son would put his father's health at risk. 

This was only supposed to last the initial 2 week quarantine. 2 weeks turned into months, 6 months a year even. I began to feel betrayed, angry that I could not do anything about it. I was a student in college with an UberEats side job. I resorted to texting him how much I hate my x husband, that I wish he was dead, the most hateful text messages I could think of.

At the same time, I was abiding by the clause within the divorce decree to see a psych my only issue being anxious and scared about the end result of divorce. Well the psych tried telling me I have ADHD put me on Adderall which made me sick, aggressive, shaky, ect. So I stopped going entirely. I've never had ADHD or any learning disability. The place loaded me on medication I don't need.. so I stopped going and taking the medication, which is against the clause within the divorce decree.

While Covid 19 was going on X husband called my doctor and they told him I had stopped going. I didn't believe I had ADHD and the medication made me sick. 

So on top of my x husband keeping me from my son over covid 19, he now was keeping me from my son because I stopped taking medication for ADHD. It was making me sick, I was having racing thoughts and issues with concentration because I was terrified and hurt that my son was taken from me. 

I was a very hands on stay at home mom. I did everything I should, loved my son and enjoyed being a mom to him.

After months of hateful texts to my x husband about keeping my son from me and the injustice of it all, I found out the governor of my state (Arizona) prohibited coparents keeping a child from the other parent over social distancing protocol. 

Infuriated after not seeing my son for over a year due to social distancing, infuriated my x husband put an unwarranted psychiatric clause in the divorce decree, I drove down to his house and began screaming and crying, beating on his front door demanding to see my son.

X husband called the police, and he took the police report and took me to family court this.

Family court was on July 5th.

He made a host of lies about me that I voluntarily stopped seeing my son, that he is scared I would flee the state with my son, that I am a prostitute, that I'm unstable ect.

Well the judge ruled in his favor that I have to have supervised visitation, continue seeing a psychiatrist, take drugs that I don't need, pay his attorney fees, and process server fees.

Now that x husband has my son I can't continue to go to college. I was dependent on the financial aid I was receiving as a single mom to get by. I had an UberEats gig where I was earning $1000 a week delivering food in my car. 

Now that UberEats has dried up now that restaurant restrictions have been lifted, I don't have financial aid I am broke, penniless, and at the moment under employed. I am about to lose my car. 

I literally want to die. I am having feelings of despair. I don't know what to do, where to turn. 

I feel attacked from all angles. 

I need help. I'm terrified about what will become of me, I'm having thoughts of suicide. I don't want to live in this kind of pain anymore.

My family is relatively silent about the issue, I think they think I am to blame for all of this.

Please I need direction. I'm terrified and my life has all but collapsed. What do I do?"
xPower4Goodx,2021-09-11 03:26:20+00:00,I’ve lost all hope,"I’ll get right to it in saying it feels like my life is falling apart. And honestly, I have no idea what I can do to change it. I have a shit job and basically a nonexistent love life since I have not been in a serious relationship in 6 years (22M now). I want to keep hope alive since I am so young, but it is so hard some days. Another huge part of my feelings of depression stem from my self-consciousness, as I don’t believe I am good looking whatsoever with 6’2 180lb build which makes me look like a twig. To add salt onto this wound I also have a baby face so I look like I am still 13 years old. The lack of women interested in me only cements this thought deeper. While I was in college, I hopped onto apps like tinder and bumble since all of my buddies said they would get laid about 4-5 times a week on average with these apps, sometimes even having threesomes. But even up until 4 years later reaching today, I have only ever gotten one hookup from these apps. I believed that it would get better when I joined my fraternity, which it did, but barely. I was so nervous to talk to the girls at our parties and social because of my previously stated insecurities about my looks. The girls I eventually did get to take back to my place were nice for a time since they would always come back, but (I shit you not) each and every one of them ended up leaving me for a much better-looking man. I know this is probably my fault as we didn’t discuss getting serious until it was too late, but I felt like I was the problem each and every time. Was I too weak for them? Too small where it mattered? I always tried to make up for my lack of not having a 9inch hose with being nice and doing everything I could to make them happy. Still, they left. I just recently started diving further into Reddit (I will not lie in saying the NSFW side) since I was still somewhat of a novice here. Since joining those subs, it makes me feel like everyone has a hose on them besides me. At least all the happy ones or the ones surrounded by women. Like I said earlier I know I’m still so young, but I’m just so ready to end this. I feel like if I don’t find my person soon like the rest of my friends than I will forever be alone leaving behind nothing, especially a family. I just want to be happy with someone who will accept my flaws and insecurities, not a girl that only cares how far into her stomach you can reach."
MarziPanda_,2021-09-11 02:20:33+00:00,Don't lose hope,"Hey

So, I just wanted to give you some encouragement because I know, right now, things are hard for you. You're probably fed up of hearing that ""someday"" things will get better. But guess what? I'm gonna say it again!😎  It WILL, get better. It will.

I have hope for you...
I have faith in you.

Yeah, I know that your feelings (or lack of feelings) have grown tiresome. But please, GIVE YOURSELF SOME CREDIT. Each day you've done yourself proud. You've made me proud and you've made others proud, just by being here today. Despite how hard it is, in this exact moment, you're still here. Reading my long ass message. 

🤔Don't you realize how strong you are..? 

Come on you talented, beautiful, unique, human beings.
Keep that positive attitude, keep your chin up and don't ever lose hope... You've got this ✊🤘✨

you're the one in control, you've got this."
SnooKiwis413,2021-09-11 01:17:01+00:00,Am I cured?," 

Over the past 3 weeks I’ve felt unbearably sad everyday, almost every symptom of a major depressive episode. My dad noticed something was up and pushed me to get help, my first ever therapy session is in 3 days (terrified btw).

But suddenly this morning, I felt different. Not in tears like usual, but not happy. Still have dark thoughts but they don’t seem to affect my mood, the pit in my stomach feels distant. Honesty I was a little relieved, not happy but I’ll take it.

But around noon my long distance gf called me, she received a gift I sent her. She opened it while on the phone with me and was elated. It was great, only one problem: I felt nothing. After the phone call I did feel a little shame (first emotion of the day woo hoo) but even that feeling is damp, for lack of a better word.

I’ve just been laying in bed since then listening to music. Is this a good sign? Bad sign? Please? Someone help?"
Ok_Music6351,2021-09-11 00:16:10+00:00,So I used to use drugs to numb the pain of childhood trauma &amp; depression,"Now I don’t. I’m sober &amp; life is boring, lonely &amp; cold. People get excited about the smallest things &amp; I just can’t get any joy? I’m on the strongest dose for depression tablets, still think about unaliving myself every night. 

If I’m in this much pain and have been from such a young age, shouldn’t I have the right to die peacefully? They should legalize euthanasia in my opinion. Only if you’ve been suffering your whole life, not just because someone in your family died or whatever.


I’ve got no family, I don’t have energy to keep up with friends, and to be honest don’t have the energy to love my boyfriend as he deserves to be loved. I do show him love &amp; do things for him. I go out of the house for him &amp; him alone. 


When I was single I would “happily” not leave the house unless to go to work or get food. “Happily” because every day life makes my heart pound &amp; I over think ever single details. I have no energy. 

If you met me you’d never guess I wrote all this, you’d think I was bubbly &amp; funny. Because I mask my social anxiety &amp; sadness through hun our. 

Let me die in peace lol"
liamXvenus,2021-09-11 00:12:47+00:00,Idk what to do,"I need to talk to strangers to feel better lol (btw sorry if i make english mistakes, i'm not good at it).

I'm a normal adolescent with a dull life. Everyday is the same day, everybody repeat same stories, i repeat same patterns which lead me nowhere.
When I'm in front of someone i'm anxious, i can't say what i want to say, i can't explain my thoughts, it's like a wall between me and other people.
I've always been lonely, it became more and more hurtful since i was 12. I feel like i fit nowhere, nobody is at my ""level"" in the way that i feel useless, pathetic, not interesting,ect...
Sometimes i tried to hide it and it made me an asshole, i don't know how to be correct, i'm too obsessed about being hated by anyone because i'm weak and alone, i don't want to be hurt.
My dad is depressed, paranoid, do drug and he makes me feel bad everytime i'm with him but i can't leave him, i feel responsible of him. My hunt told me he is still alive because of me.
I'd like to run away from my life.
My mom is in a toxic relation with her possessive boyfriend. She can't be an ear to listen to me, she always thinks it's her fault and talking never helped anyway.
I feel like my parents have never really be here for me but this though makes me ungrateful.
Anyway, i have no personality, i copy everyone, the only thing that push me is my ego.
I want to be better than everybody because of my inferiority complex.
Now i'm scared and i hate everyone in my life.
When i'm anxious i often think that i could enter in a cult haha.
My grandma made a joke about it this summer hahaha.
My family is condescending, thinking that they stopped being catholic but still having same ideas.
I don't have any passions anymore because i feel bad everytime i try to do something.
I do bike but it's only automatic.
My psy isn't helping me at all, she gives bad advinces like staying with toxic friends who keeps me doing drugs even if i'm in a bad trip everytime i do it.
People only come at me because I'm a replacement friend or they feel pity for me or i can buy them drugs lol.
I'd like to play video games like before but lol it makes me feel bad as well.
I'd like to die but i'm too scared of death.
What if life is a loop lol.
I'd like to be perfect to be loved but i'm only an human.
I know i miss my dad's recognition and i should don't care because i'm supposed to found it in me lol.
I'd like to say fuck to everything.
People judgement affect me too much.
I want somebody to kill me.
I don't want to go to the hospital, it's like hell.
I'm in an existential crisis, anxious, depressed, lonely and my heart feels like a stone.
I lost 70% of it in a bad trip and bad relationships.
Emotions don't want to come out anymore except a cynical laugh.
I smoke a lot but i hate it.
Every lifes are mistakes.
I know it's a call in the void, just need to write other where than in my notes.
The only good news is that my repeated nightmares stopped.
I take zoloft but it only helps me do bike.
I don't want to die alone.
I don't have any sexual pleasure.
I'm an idiot, a naive.
Even Eldorado won't satisfy me.
The fun fact is idk what i want, i mean I'm lying to myself because the reasons makes me feel too pathetic.
I'll stop here."
popeyes-37,2021-09-10 22:32:36+00:00,How fucking an escort at 17 ruined my life,I was always a shy kid in high school never really fit and dated meanwhile all my high school friends were dating and stuff.I am a decent looking I lift 6 times a week but I always had insecurities even tho everyone compliments my physique saying you got big.My self esteem was so low that I missed out in high school everybody got laid got dates but I was so shy and insecure even some chicks were flirting with me but I didn’t realize it at the time.I only had a  friend he was also like me so one day we decided to bang an escort they were like 18-24 and Russian I looked at their pictures from the link my friend gave me and I wanted it so bad because I feel I missed out in high school on a lot of stuff. So my friend fucked a 19 year old Russian escorts he was 18 I was 17 I also messaged an escort and I went to her.The first questions he asked me was how old are you I looked a bit young so I bullshited and said 19 she said okay. And she was a solid Russian 9.5/10 blonde I couldn’t believe I was actually getting laid for the first time. I had endorphins and all type of hormones rushing through my body. It was good until I decided to eat her out i wasn’t thinking straight at the time I just thought of how hot she looked with her cute little innocent face. The second day I woke up vomiting feeling sick and weak body I was freaking out i thought it was some std I ended up having a mental breakdown and telling my mom after it lasted for about 1.5 weeks I couldn’t eat anything. Everything I eat I vomit it out. I am thankful I have an open minded mom instead of putting more pressure on me she was trying to calm me down. I researched and thought I have some std then went to the hospital and stayed their for 2 days and they gave me salane because I couldn’t eat. My friend was feeling so bad that time he thought it was all his fault he made me do this and tried to apologize but I told him it’s not ur fault it’s a choice I made. 3 weeks later I was beginning to feel better then 2 month I was starting to get slight genital itching and nausea I decided to go get tested for hiv/hepatitis it was like playing Russian roulette if I had it I would have ended my life but thankfully it’s turned out negative. My anxiety was through the roof when I got tested I couldn’t sleep that time. I still have some genital itching and feel nauseous sometimes in the morning.I have ptsd from that time until today that I don’t want to got through again now I am in university and gonna do it the right way and go on dates.this is one of my biggest regrets in life and I feel like it wasn’t special it was like a transaction.only me and my best friend know about this I feel it’s so hard to talk with this about people they judge you and see you as a different person and think you are messed up. So I wanted to let it all out on Reddit because it sorta bring a me confront when you talk with people about it. Because that day I though I would die in the hospital I was drained of energy insomnia high heart rate idk why this happened until this day. Idk if I have somthing or if it was jus my anxiety. And I am so thankful to have supportive parents if I didn’t it could have destroyed me mentally

For as long as I can remember I’ve always dreamt of being a mom and lately seeing everyone around me and so many friends or family members growing a family is really hard to witness .. I am happy for everyone and I’m so supportive and over all always put others feelings before mine but some days I sit and cry and sleep and lay in bed in agonizing pain knowing the emptiness of my own womb .. it’s been three years and everyone is always so positive about saying you’ll be a mom someday but I don’t want someday I’m ready now and all I desire is to have a bond souly of my own. Adoption is an amazing idea and someday I would love to but I want to experience pregnancy .. I want to feel the life grow within me .. I want things to be natural and beautiful .. I beat myself up on a daily basis and I can feel   A dark deep episode of depression coming on."

summerstorm93,2021-09-10 18:12:49+00:00,Just tired of feeling this way,"What is the best way to get through that empty, lonely feeling? I feel like I’m never really excited about anything. Every week is the same, even if I do different things. I feel like I’m losing my youth. I don’t have close friends and I’ve been trying to get out of my comfort zone and make them, but I just feel like everyone else knows some secret to making/keeping friendships that I missed. Can always blame it on the Aspergers but I feel like it’s just me that’s not very likable. I’m jealous of the people I know who have meaningful and close friendships. It’s depressing af. I thought I’d feel better (and I do a little) after getting out of a really toxic relationship but I still just feel crappy. I mean I felt this way before that as well so I guess it’s not that surprising. And I’m very grateful for the few friendships I do have, I just feel like I’m not truly close to people. End rant I guess, I dunno."

Iambadokay,2021-09-10 16:29:17+00:00,18 year old depressed boy,"Honestly, never really posted. Not really anything. But this isn’t for help or anything. I want people to know there are people there for them, people in this subreddit can relate to others. I was hit when I was a kid, and was always depressed. Suicidal since I was conscious basically. It only gets worse when family trash talks you. I have a messy room, and if I even try to clean it they ask if everything is fine and if I’m gonna kill myself. 

I can’t do stuff I want, I always wanted to die, so now that I’m done with high school. I don’t know what to do. Without all the boring parts. I want to say this, in my eyes I’m too far gone. But I know this girl, I had a weird dream and remembered she existed. I use to distance myself from people, but she use to check up on me. So I messaged her one day, and a few days later she responds. She is also depressed, and wanted to make sure I was okay. I hated her eyes. Cold, like mine. We have such beautiful eyes too. Green and blue. But recently her eyes seem better, she seems happier. It’s amazing, if any reason I wouldn’t want to die. I wouldn’t want her to be sad. But, I don’t get this. I might be doing this wrong. 

But, I’m making this post to once again say. There is hope, she first asked if I wanted to die with her. I don’t think she thinks that way anymore. I’m not saying depression can go away, but if you have even one person you want to check up on. Or one person you are friends with. Check up on them, let them check up on you. You’re never too far gone, I hope everyone the best in life. And that’s hypocritical since I am still depressed and suicidal. Im glad I reached out for her. If I didn’t, we both might’ve been dead. Sorry for taking up your time. Just wanted to spread some positivity, I truly do hope the best for everyone. Have a great day"
Agitated-Ad9656,2021-09-10 14:15:30+00:00,Parental pressure,"I’m a high school student, strict asian parents and all. For my schoolwork, I always try so hard to get the best score, the best of the class, and two years ago I made it into a selective entry school, so I’m basically surrounded by the smartest kids in the state. Every single time a report comes out, I’m happy with my scores because I compare them to my class and see how I went and I did quite well, but my parents constantly say I’m not good enough, and interrogate me in the most confrontational way saying things like ‘why didn’t you do well’ and ‘why are you falling backwards’ when I’m getting top scores in every subject but one. All this pressure is getting to my head, I recently broke up with my ex of 1.5 years too, so my mental state isn’t in the best place, and hasn’t been for a while. Some days I just wanna give it all up and end it to end the pain you know."

Ive had insomnia for the past 6 months and It’s a horrible feeling knowing that I have to get up for school in 3 hours and i haven’t even gotten sleep. last month (August) and this month has been horrible with a lot of stuff happening. I feel really lonely, I hate waking up everyday it feels horrible and having to walk 30 mins back home after school and sometimes to school is very exhausting. School itself is just very stressful. I have a couple of friends but i don’t talk to them much except for 2 at school but only during one class and lunch. I also just want to feel loved and theres this girl in my class and shes cute but i asked her for her number and she said no. It was very embarrassing and I just started to get sad because I want a girl that’s genuinely loves me and I've never seen a girl that I actually found very attractive and its also sad that I’m probably never going to even get a chance to at least be her friend. Ive also been really sick physically for the past week or two and i don't know if it because of depression or something else. I always try to find the meaning of life but I cant and I don’t want to deal with this anymore and I think about dying in my sleep a lot. I just want life to get better and I want to be happy but i don’t know what to do."

Not me ! I have lived for what exactly ?? Apart of taking in alone while others have their best life i am here wasting mine for what ?! I am tired. I want to stop that bullshit life that is mine. I don't need a psy i am old enough to understand the bullshit meaningless life i have right now. No one. Suffering. Depression. Anxiety. For what no one will read that or care apart to say go fuck yourself and get therapy no i wont go outside for what ?!

MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-10 11:58:02+00:00,My anger’s boiled over and I can’t put the fucking lid back on,"I’m just so fucking angry. It’s taking everything in me to resist the urge to destroy everything I come into contact with, wanna fucking snap my phone in half as I write this. Keep almost ripping doors off their hinges. I was cutting chicken the other night and it kept sliding under the knife cause it wasn’t sharp enough and I just fucking lost it and stabbed it over and over again. Think mostly I wanna destroy myself more than anything else.

I’ve been pissed off for a while, but it peaked yesterday during a workout, I literally couldn’t finish it cause I was so fucking angry and that only pissed me off more. I haven’t come back down since. I’ve just blown my fucking cap and there’s no putting it back on. Feels like I’m seconds away from drinking again or cutting. I’m gonna relapse, don’t think there’s any way around that at this point, it’s gonna fucking happen. I’m just not gonna be able to put up with this for much longer. Wish I had something stronger than alcohol but I don’t, so I guess I’ll have to settle. Gonna be 4 months down the fucking drain but it feels inevitable cause this shit ain’t going away. Doesn’t fucking matter anyway, life’s way worse sober, don’t care what the fuck they say about “alcohol makes it worse”, I’m suicidal either way, but I found the suffering easier to tolerate when I was drink and shit. 

But fuck it, I can’t get the anger away from me, I don’t know how to do it. It gets worse during workouts. Wasn’t sure why, could be an adrenaline thing or a heart rate thing or a hormone thing or whatever, but I think it’s mainly that I’m just sitting there with my fucking thoughts and nothing drowns them out. Even listening to my music at full volume doesn’t drown them out. It’s all just fucking revenge fantasies and shit. All the people I wanna fucking scream at or beat the shit out of or fucking strangle to death with my bare hands. Don’t know what the fuck to do about it. And just cause I know it’s gonna get suggested, yeah I go to therapy, I have been for two years, it doesn’t help. Neither do any of the dozens and fucking dozens of mediations I’ve tried.

Don’t know what the fuck you’re supposed to do when you’re full of so much fucking rage that it’s totally overtaking your brain."
vishnu1232,2021-09-10 10:13:40+00:00,Tired of being an idiot all the time.,"Why is so hard for me to understand basic stuff ? My dad get's pissed off when I take time to understand what he talks about most of the time.

Had a conversation with a friend a while ago, he is leaps and bounds away from me in terms of maturity and knowledge. Whenever he comes home my dad is so happy to talk to him and tries his best to humiliate me infront of him. I know Im just average but give me a break.

I don't even talk with him unless there is a reason now. It's like when I think about something my brain gets somekind of block which restricts me to think any further and ends up with a confusion. I'm sad all day and people wants someone that knows stuff.

every night i imagine im in a happy loving marriage w a wife that loves me and who reciprocates my wanting to see another person whos intimate to me succeed.

every night i realize im a fucking retarded 18 year old who knows shit about socializing or even speaking like someone whos not a schizo.

i just started college and have so long to go. i just want to skip all this meaningless fluff and get to when i start having true independence.

ive only ever had one gf and i would barely even call her a gf. we hugged a lot and i kissed her on her head once. then she realized just how unlikeable i rly am. that was over a year ago.

i wonder if me telling myself that i am going to die alone is keeping my expectations in check or creating a self fulfilling prophecy.

my fetishes are so fucking cringy i hate myself. i fantasize about a girl clasping me in her arms. i fantasize about nibbling her ear and telling her i love her. i fantasize about showering together and cooking together. i fantasize about her teasing me. i fantasize about raising a child together.

i hate myself. i hate waking up and having to face something so disgusting in the mirror every morning."

At 2 am tonight, he told me he burned himself with a lighter. It wasn't much and he regrets it..still..It broke me. Doing everything you can but not being enough. Ignoring yourself to get him back up but him not being able to do so.

For as much as i hate to say this: he is taking me down with him. To the point where i began to cut myself, become less social, lose all my interests, tried water poisoning and strangling myself. Whenever i look in the mirror, i just feel disgusted. 

Recently, i broke up with my boyfriend because i just don't want to take him down with me. I don't feel like i deserve him. And for the reason that i stopped feeling emotions for most of the things and people i used to love. He talked about it and convinced me to stay because he knows about my mental health. I later found out that i broke up the same day his dog died..which made me hate myself even more. Half of the time i feel like i am an outsider, standing with people and hearing what they are saying but not being able to say stuff back.

We went on a trip with friends and i reached such a low point that i began to drink myself sick. Lately i have been noticing that the usage of alcohol becomes a problem ones i begin. Eventually, i start to feel better, but at first it makes me feel worse, so i keep going untill i basically feel and see nothing anymore. I didn't eat a lot those days, most of the time i only ate dinner and 1/4th of the lunch i normally eat.

At night i listen to music to which i can relate and cry sometimes. Same today, it's already 6:06 am and i still haven't slept. Had a small anxiety attack at 3 am and since then i can't close my eyes the slightest bit.

I haven't told anyone about this yet, apart from my boyfriend or whatever you would call us now, and some kind stranger on discord. But still one of my friends spoke to me about it. I can't even hide simple emotions anymore. Everywhere i go, i cause pain and disappointment. Someone told me i go from the one failure to the other. And yk what, maybe they are right. I have thought about my goodbye notes and how i could die silently and in peace. Idk what to do anymore. I'm just so tired of everything and everyone here."

But I really feel like no matter what I do, I can’t make a relationship work. And obviously the common denominator is me. I think about how dismal my future looks all the time. And I put too much value in someone loving me. I don’t love myself. I hate the way I look but don’t do enough to change it. Which then makes me feel guilty. I have run from a lot of different situations which are catching up to me. All because I don’t know how to deal with guilt. I’ve been diagnosed with general anxiety and OCD. My psychiatrist said that when I get anxious, I obsess over the anxiety and can’t get out of the loop. But I hate the way the meds made me feel. I really think I’m just broken and can’t be fixed. Anyway. I think I just needed to write all this out. I don’t expect any solutions. Thanks for reading."

sorrowfulself,2021-09-09 22:53:57+00:00,welp.,"\*apologies for the long post, but if you read it all i really appreciate it\*

that pretty much sums it up. life has been really, really sucky for me recently. i have posted in this community with my main reddit account in the past - but that was because i didn't think i'd be posting here more than twice and since i clearly may be here for a while, i figured i would make an account just for me to be sad with. a good analogy to describe my life would be: life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get but you know damn well it is laced with laxatives. to go more in depth with that analogy, essentially everything in my life has pretty much been a shit show (no pun intended). even the things that seem like they are amazing and are helping my life get back to where it was just a few mere months ago end up making everything go down hill. i get this false sense of hope when things seem like they are turning around and then it just goes bad. what sucks even more is that i am stuck in a hell that i created. everything i am currently dealing with is my fault to an extent. to make matters even worse, i am not even the one that can get me out of this hell right now. and while i try not to with every inch of my being, mind and soul; it seems as if i am pushing the person that can pull me out of this hell even further away.

&amp;#x200B;

i try not to display emotions too much, as i feel it isn't fair to place my burdens on other people when i know that they have burdens of their own - that's what my therapist gets paid to do, listen to my emotions and problems but that's neither here nor there. i don't mean to make some long pity essay or make you read my rambling thoughts that are coming out of my brain but i honestly didn't know where else to go. while i don't personally know most likely anyone here, i trust you all in a way with these feelings and to an extent i feel comfortable opening up about them. now none of you know my real identity and the chances of any of you ever knowing is very slim, so the question of ""why would i be uncomfortable opening up to strangers on reddit?"" still stands, but that's exactly it. you are all strangers, and while i am telling you all that i am going through hard times, i don't know what you're going through. idk, maybe what i just said made absolutely no sense. i just wish things would go back to the way they were.

&amp;#x200B;

i won't lie, i am terrified. i don't know what the future holds and that scares me to an extent. i know that there will be hardships and happy moments, but i don't know who is going to experience them with me and that is ultimately what scares me about the unknown. if you haven't/couldn't catch on yet, this whole post is essentially about my girlfriend, well. ex-girlfriend at the moment. i love her to death and we want to get back together but we both need to work on ourselves on our own for the time being and not being with her is the hardest thing i have ever experienced. there is so much i want to do with her both now and in the future and i am working my ass off to be the best for myself so that i can be the best for us, but it feels like every step forward i take is two steps backwards and all i want is to have five steps forward and one step backward. i want to go back to how things were, where we laughed so hard our stomachs ached in pain, where we smiled so big our mouths hurt. and if i am being honest, i can't see myself doing those things with anyone else. i'm sorry for writing such a long post, i kinda just rambled on and it felt good, if only i could do this on my college essays. for those of you that read all the way through, thank you. even though i don't know who you are it means a lot."

ladiec17,2021-09-09 22:34:24+00:00,But why?,"On paper my life looks great I'm engaged, good job, new pup. But I'm burnt out, my stress levels are through the roof. I'm mad all the time. I don't know how to properly function. I don't remember the last time I had a ""normal"" day. I used to love to paint. I used to love to cook. I literally cannot remember the last time I've done either... I have serious trust issues and have pushed away friends, avoiding social situations and now my regular doctor is on Mat leave...so I met with her replacement and she's prescribed meds that my pharmacy refused to fill for me, twice now, because they interact with others... Tried to get another apt with her to correct again this second time and I can't see her again for a month. Meanwhile, feeling suicidal but afraid to actually say it and be committed......... Where do I even go from here? 

Ive read about neuroplasticity and that has honestly helped me so much in the past few years, our brains are incredible. So I'm trying to stay hopeful and take it day by day... But I have so many insecurities and fears that I'm going to ruin everything I finally have going for me... I've got so much junk suppressed deep down... I don't even know where to begin with dealing with it. I have PTSD, doc confirmed that, and I'm trying to find therapy, but its terrifying. I tried to ask for referral but she's not from the area.... What do I do? Do I really need to get a new doctor now too? 

Any suggestions for where to start?

I knew that due to this my mind would start to lose functionality earlier than most ppl. Well, after a few concussions from car accidents ""I wasn't driving"" and this last time the doc's took me off these meds my functionality dropped big time. I can't remember things and I feel lost all the time. Everyone just brushes it off. There's times I'm very lucid like now. Other times I can't even read a sentence and make sense of it. I feel my mind slowly going and I'm trying to warn ppl and ask for help but no one believes me or they use it against me. 😥 No one listens and no one cares. I sit here getting laughed at by my own mom about this. No wonder my grandpa didn't let the family know he was getting dementia. There's no real mental health or medical care where I live. So I guess I just sit here and wait to die. I bet even if I were having a heart attack I would still be ignored. 

There's so many times I wish I wasn't a miracle baby. The miracle is that I was even born. Really wish I wasn't. I never asked to be part of this world and get crushed at every turn. At least I've hit the half way point in my life span. Not too much longer to go."

I’m from New Orleans and just endured one of the scariest disasters we’ve had in the last 16 years (Katrina, anyone?). I do know that it was a trending topic on Reddit and news sites like CNN. 

My ex, who was madly in love with me up until a few months ago, never checked up on me. We didn’t have the best breakup, but I’m still totally in love with her. She wanted to go no contact after we tried to be just friends for a few weeks and I didn’t do a very good job of handling it. 

I wasn’t really expecting it, but I did have like 1% of hope that she would break and message me to see if I was ok. That she still cared for me, even though she wanted to move on. But there was nothing. And that fucking hurt….

She uses Reddit a lot. That’s how we met actually. She watches American news sometimes. What are the chances she wouldn’t have heard of it happening?  

I guess she really doesn’t care about me anymore. Because I don’t see how someone who does couldn't reach out to see if someone they used to love was ok."

Having rapid ups and downs. All over the fucking place. But every single day without fail, every time I’ve gone to exercise it been making me fucking furious.

I literally couldn’t even get though my leg workout just now, did two sets and during the second one I was so fucking angry I had the overwhelming compulsion to hurl the weights at a wall, ended up just slamming them together hard cause I was trying to scratch the itch somehow. But I was just so pissed of after that that I picked up my bench and slammed it into the ground over and over. Then I just walked out of my garage. Which pisses me off more now cause I fucking botched the whole fucking workout. Even as I’m typing this I’m getting the constant urge to snap this fucking phone in half.

Yesterday I was cutting chicken for my dinner right after my workout and it was sliding under the knife cause it wasn’t sharp enough and I got so frustrated I started just relentlessly stabbing the chicken over and over again. Today I don’t even want to go down to cook. Had to leave the kitchen cause every part of me want to just throw the chicken I defrosted in the bin and smash the plate it was on. 

I don’t know what the fuck is going on. I feel like I’m seconds away from relapsing and drinking a bunch of alcohol. Only things stopping me are the calories and the fact that it won’t make any fucking difference anyway, probably. But I just wanna be in a different state. Like right fucking now.

DaisyLeader,2021-09-09 10:20:46+00:00,I screw up so much I embarrass myself,"So the other day I (F21) slept through my roommates trying to get into out shared home. they left eventually, and I went to work. When i came home it was hell, the landlord offered to evict me and they said no because they were being nice. Before this we all had a decent relationship but now I've ruined it. I also am late on this months rent (because i suck at managing my money) and probably wont have the rest until next week. They don't know and I am afraid the landlord will evict me if I email. The plan is to pay it it of course but what if the landlord is now just tired of my shit and uses this as a way to evict me? This conversation w my roommates really reminded me again how one mistake could make me homeless, one minute too late at work and I'm broke and eventually homeless. I have no friends and recently I've broken my only means of transport (bike) and my phone. No money to get those things fixed anytime soon yay. To top it all off the only bright spot in my life, my gf, has been watching this shit show from the sidelines. I am a mess, and while I try so hard to maintain a positive attitude for her I feel broken. Why is she still dating me, literally I am without any assets rn. I'm embarrassed for everyone involved in my life, I just want to stop existing atp so I can have a moment where I don't suck so badly."
Newman303,2021-09-09 09:24:51+00:00,Feeling so down,"I've had a lot on my mind recently, mainly surrounding my homosexual thoughts that I suppressed since around 10 years old. My family know that I'm homosexual and they're okay with it but they probably think I won't be in 10 years time. But this has all caused me to start being jealous of men. I never wanted to be trans and I still don't but I can't help but watch TV and want to be some of the male characters. I think it's mainly because I would have a much better dating life if I wasn't a lesbian.

I can remember acting like a boy in my early years of primary school, but this was mainly so I could kiss my friends hands in a game that we used to play where I was the disney prince. I'm feeling sick right now thinking about how I can't get rid of this resentment when I see men that would be able to date as many women as they want. I know that I don't want to be a man in the long run and this jealousy will hopefully pass. I feel so sad and lonely when I think about this.

I don't really know what I'm asking for while writing this. But maybe some advice from people who have to deal with this as well which is probably not a lot of people."
A_lonely_gal02,2021-09-09 06:20:54+00:00,Note to self :/,"I know that you’re not in a good place right now, I know that you want to die, I know you so well but I don’t know you at all at the same time, where did you go? Where did all the happiness go? Have you ever been happy? Or have you been pretending your whole life?

I know it’s hard to believe but you’ve never had a moment where you’re genuinely happy, I know… I know those “happy moments” are not what you want, they don’t feel like happiness used to feel when you were a kid, when you woke up on Christmas morning and saw a lot of presents or when you ate at the table with the family and you got to make everything pretty for everyone, like when you got your first dog…

I guess you forgot what actual happiness feels like over the years, and as they went by you kept looking for it in the worse places and you regret it so much, that was not a life… it was a blur, a fog, a moment that now it’s forgotten but the scars live, they eat you, the things you did and what they made you on the outside, all the hard stones this life has thrown you.

I know you’re scared, scared of the future and the past… scared of life, of society and how you don’t fit in it, I know you’re scared of how you see yourself and what you do to your body…

I don’t have encouraging words for you because I am in the same place, you’re lost, you’re alone and you’re scared. You’ve let yourself go, bad…

I’m so sorry for you, I’m so sorry for the life you’ve had to live and the life you have, I wish I could say you deserve better but I’m not so sure if you do, what you deserve is a change, a drastic one but honestly I don’t see your life changing any time soon, I know you’re sad, very sad… 

I know you’d give anything to be someone else, outside of your skin, outside of all the imperfections and flaws that you see on yourself, I know what you’ve done to you and others, but I don’t know you at all…

I don’t know who you are, I don’t know what you like, I don’t know your personality, I don’t know how you are with people and I don’t know how you are in a relationship, I don’t know if you’re a person at all…

All you want is to be alone and disappear, leave everything behind and find yourself, know yourself and be happy, but it is hard dealing with your head, not knowing what’s going on, not being aware of anything or anyone anymore.

I’m sorry I made you this way, I hope that if we ever find happiness you could forgive all the pain that has consumed your whole life to the point where the happy memories are just memories, the normal memories are forgotten and the bad ones scar you so deep you can’t even feel anymore…

I hope you find light."
hair-problems,2021-09-09 06:04:29+00:00,work is the enemy,"No matter which job/ career I have held, depression and anxiety takes over my body each time and unfortunately most recently. I have only begun discussing my anxiety and depression with my partner and to myself. I know I dont allow myself to get too dark, but I know if I don't there will be no escape for me. 

I cannot help but be filled with anxiety, loneliness, outcasted and depressed at the thought of working until my body is frail and unable to move. I want to refuse going  into work and rid my mind of all the weight of my own intrusive thoughts. 

I need to escape this way of life or I will have lived for nothing other than capital gain for my country. 

I have been jobless before and I cannot say I was happy with not working either. I am now in a position where I have begun 2 careers and now have options with jobs and I hate it. Yes there is a good feeling of feeling of being wanted in a position, but after the interview it is very short- lived. 

I am with someone who quite literally would not retire even after their body is well broken. I admire them for their preservance for wanting to create a lifestyle of choice and a household with assets. But I do not want to be on this ride any longer. 

I am done with the interviews, prepping for a new role, having small talk, getting dressed, brushing my hair everyday, smiling when all I want to do is cry! I am trapped in my life and feel there is no rational escape."

I have kids, but I’m just a means to an end for their lives - the driver, the person who pays for life or makes dinner. They don’t really need me or want me.

I'm at a point now where my meagre income doesn't cover my most basic outgoings. That's without buying any food or traveling to do shopping. I don't see a reasonable way out of this, I have enough opioids to knock out an elephant.

I constantly hear “I’m tired of you, or how you act or the things you say”

I die a lot everyday but I still live… being alive and feeling the way that I do hurts. Everyone thinks I over react to things but to me those feels are raw, and that’s how I feel. I feel like everyone gets to feel and say how they want but I can’t, I get told not to feel that way. They don’t know how much I want to just not exist anymore. Their words literally kill me and seems like they don’t even notice.

I lost my smile, and vibrant personality and became a dark person, yet not cares enough to notice. My husband doesn’t know how close he is to not having me anymore. It really sucks. But if they would pay attention to me they would see I’m drowning right in front of them. 

It stinks not being able to feel the way I want to feel while everyone else gets to. I usually try to stay happy. But when I get upset I’m not allowed to feel a certain way. 

I don’t want to die I just want the pain to stop. I just want someone to show me they care. But I’m no ones anyone. I’ll be gone before they know it."

I try my hardest in work, I try to make friends, I try to get stuff done..

 Still I work more than 8 hours of overtime in a week and can't really afford more than my bills and gas. I get screamed at and treated like crap by my boss. I think my boyfriend only comes over to screw and he sometimes makes me feel horrible. My mom won't ever visit and ignores my calls, my dad only talks to me when he's trying to get ahold of my mom or he's mad. My family is all toxic and horrible to be around, I have no friends. I can't even talk to people in work because every detail about everyone goes around, it's so irritating. I'm tired of coming home and having nobody to talk to or spend time with, can't sleep in because I feel like I'm wasting my life away. Can't read, play games, sketch, crochet, cooks, anything anymore. I feel like I have nothing, no one to call when I need someone and nowhere to go but my room. Everyday I'm yelled at, or treated like crap by family or coworkers. 
I just want someone to hangout with, or I wish my boyfriend would want to spend more time with me actually doing stuff. 
I have a lot of past trauma and I've dealt with so much worse, but more than half of my life I've just been wishing I wouldn't wake up. It's getting so hard, forcing myself to work and eat, to try and talk to people. I don't want to do nothing, but I don't want to try anymore. I wish I could see, hear, or talk.
Idk, I'm exhausted, I just want a break but have nowhere to go to get a break. I'm so tired of starving to look skinny, not being able to afford new clothes, food, gas, oil, work supplies, etc."

I've taken a lot of drugs to try and ease the pain but the pain stays forever no matter what i do I can't escape this nightmare scape of life. 

 I work a Telesales job that I hate because I never figured out what I wanted to do in life.

I'm socially awkward and I would much rather cease to exist I've not felt happiness in a long time.

I don't blame anyone else but myself tbh i just go with the flow all the time I don't think about stuff because I don't care and I ceased caring a long time ago. 

 I hate everyone in this world but myself the most and I've tried suicide attempts several times I have friends and I'm thankful for them but to say I'm happy is a lie and I've finally had enough I was going to kill myself last year on my birthday but then my sister came to see me with her boyfriend I'm only 21 and I'll be 22 next month so I decided to end the pain on my next birthday something I should of done a year ago.

I mean I hate to leave this early but I've seen a lot and done a lot experienced a lot of things I'm happy to leave next month tbh I'm not doing this for attention I just generally don't want to be here anymore. 

I hit my peak a couple years ago and I hate living plus my general health has been on a decline Chest Pains and discomfort has been ruining my physical health since my Xanax overdose last year.

I'm just very tired and wanna leave this rock I didn't give my permission to be born here I did my time now it's time to leave."

tmxsmx,2021-09-08 10:00:39+00:00,To those suffering from atypical depression,"I have suffered from atypical depression for about 2 years, maybe longer but I didn’t think there was something wrong with me. I just presumed this was my character and I just had to live with it. 

But 1 year ago I started my medical internship and my depression affected me badly, I just couldn’t care to do my job properly, I used to go back home from the hospital at 5 o’clock and head right to bed and don’t wake up until the next morning. I’m a good student and graduated second on my class but I don’t know what happened. 

I saw how my peers connected with their seniors and established connections with other staff and secured jobs at their desired specialty but I finished my internship with 0 accomplishments and didn’t get any job. 

2 months ago I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist and explained my symptoms: increased appetite, increased sleeping duration, chronic fatigue and no desire to do anything, and he diagnosed me with atypical depression (I learned that the symptoms of this type of depression also include: heaviness in the limbs and chronic rejection sensitivity, which I definitely suffer from). He prescribed Prozac, but after reading a punch of comments online about the side effects I chickened out and didn’t take the medication. 

My question is to those suffering from atypical depression and are taking Prozac or any other medication, do you think it has improved all the symptoms and your quality of life in general? I’m at a crossroads right now and have to do something if I want to accomplish anything. 


Thank you"

Acrobatic-Can4361,2021-09-08 07:27:13+00:00,I feel depressed and I don't know what to do,"  

Hello to whoever is reading this,

I (22m) am a college student, former collegiate athlete and am going through a tough time right now and need some opinions on what to do. I am being truthful right now. Sorry if this is long and I rant. 

I have come to realize that no one outside my family really cares about me and am feeling really depressed. 

I have a problem with making up stories, sh\*t talking people, and gossiping and struggle to control making up stories (I have the gossip and crap talking parts under control now). This is definitely part of my problem. I consider myself socially awkward. I am a difficult person to be around.  This makes me believe that I am definitely a toxic person to be around. 

I have never been good at making friends in my entire life. I have realized that my “friends” that I do have don’t really care about me. They never have tried to contact me unless if it is for something they need from me (I am really good with technology and computers).  It is definitely one-sided friendships where I have to ask them to hang out or do whatever with them. 

I was on a team with both boys and girls. A couple of semesters ago, my teammates bullied me because of the making-up stories and the gossip. It got to the point where I “quit” my team (stopped going to practices, etc.). That was the only time they reached out to me to make sure I was ok and that I would come back to my team. I decided to return to the team to make my parents proud and so I could put that I was a collegiate athlete on my job resume. Luckily for me, Covid lockdowns hit and I didn’t have to deal with them for a while. When I had to return to school, I basically alienated myself from them to avoid the gossip part (which has worked). I ended up having a hard time with school during that semester and ended up drinking a lot and having some bad thoughts (not suicidal or homicidal, but wanting to leave everything and start a new life somewhere else in the world). This caused me to be hospitalized because someone was “afraid for their safety” even though I would usually want to be alone during that time. Eventually, my team and coaches heard about my hospitalization and some acted unusually nice to me, while others started to make up rumors about me being mentally unstable even though I stopped excessively drinking and was feeling fine. My head coach at the time is not a big believer in mental health and believes that people with mental health should just deal with it and has said that multiple times. When I returned and had my meeting with him and the assistant (assistant is really cool btw and I can confide in him the problems that I had) he decided for just that meeting that he was going to act like an advocate for mental health. He is full of sh\*t and I’m happy that after this semester I never have to see his fake a\*s ever again. What didn’t help was that my athletic trainer who I confided in told one of the other athletic trainers who ended up telling another team at my college all of my problems. From then on for the rest of the year, I was known to the athletes as the guy with the fucked up problems. From this moment on I decided to alienate myself from everyone except my family and I would lie to them talking about how I was hanging out with people so they would worry about me being anti-social. I actually felt good and happy that I wouldn’t have to deal with them again. 

I have since “graduated” from the team even though I have a semester left, I have been stressed with college, and the fact that me making up stories has gotten even more out of hand. I am honestly just at the point where to fix this problem I am just only going to speak when spoken to and talk really briefly and in short sentences. Even though I don’t drink anymore, the dark thoughts about leaving have started to reemerge, and have started to realize that I have very few people to help me, and the people that I do have I am afraid to tell them about all of this in fear that they won’t ever look at me the same again. I don’t know what to do?"

teenonasaturdaynight,2021-09-08 03:41:49+00:00,i don't know exactly how i feel," Right now I kind of feel numb but at the same time I feel very overwhelmed too but I don't know what I am feeling. Also, even though I am not clinically diagnosed , I feel like I have been suffering depression from the past year but the thing is that I find ways to tell myself otherwise. I feel like I am manipulating myself into making me think that I am suffering from depression, like the whatever I feel is invalid because I might be imitating whatever I've seen from the internet or tv shows. But then I also feel like I am not in control of my thoughts, like I am just making things up. It's hard to explain. I feel like I don't have a personality so much so that I am hyper aware of what I am thinking ( maybe it's because I have too much time in my hands to waste since I'm not doing anything productive). I am so aware of what I am thinking that I have to explain and assess it right after I have thought the thought. It's like a battle within my head. In the beginning, there were feelings of sadness and desperation but now I feel like I don't care at all, there is nothing that makes me happy. For a moment I do worry but the next moment I just give up worrying maybe its because I'm exhausted but I'm not even trying. Apparently just existing itself exhausting. I do laugh and have a good days, I'm not a complete stone, but after I do that it goes back to how it was and then I fall into a debate within myself whether whatever I am feeling is real or am I just faking it. It's a never ending cycling. I want it to stop. I feel like I am attacking myself. I feel hopeless"

It sickens me that my death would be an invitation for them to gather and spread lies and I wouldn't be able to call them out . However I guess that wouldn't be much different than my life I guess that's what sickens me is that it wouldn't change anything except it would be a large gathering instead of an everyday event."

Ravan2000,2021-09-08 00:29:03+00:00,Just my thoughts and my story,"My break happend last year during first wave of corona, my gf just one day text me tahat she doesn't have any feelings for me and a day before that we were having video call happily after that day i have no idea of what happend for 2-3 months all I remember was that i was broken used to cry everyday and there was this feeling of emptiness that is still there, my friends tries to help me alot but that incident changed me made me into someone that i still don't that know, i still remeber that  how i used to stand in front of mirror and literally i used to practice smiling but all i do was to cry it was like a simple task like seeing a smile on my face or to see my self laugh genuinely became impossible i used to strech my lips just to make myself look as if I'm smiling and used to laugh maniacally for don't know how long just make myself believe that i can still smile i can still laugh i can still be happy, for months i kept myself isolated from my family from my friends because of the fear that i am not myself and i might do something or said something to them that I don't believe in that i will regret later and that it's best for everyone if they stay away from me as my demons my darkness is something that no one should have a impact on, i tried my best to be positive yet all i could was negativity for me and for everyone else at one moment i just want the whole world to burn as it was nothing more than a hell where everyone is suffering, before all this i was really strong both mentally, physically and emotionally and i was real good i could say that i used to see good in other and genuinely want good for others but after all this i have become really weak especially emotionally don't know why, is it because now i can actually understand what a person is really going through and what depression really is. But on other hand I'm also getting away from the humanity as sometimes i don't consider anyone my friend or family.
Right now there are more than more things that i wanna say but I've no one with whom i can share that what's in my mind maybe that's why I'm writing here, and to be honest i don't know if anyone is even going to read this but it kinda makes me relief. Maybe I'll do this again maybe through this I'll finally get solution of all my problems that I've been looking for all this time."

bigggbitch,2021-09-07 22:44:49+00:00,I don’t know what to do anymore,"Literally what the title says. I feel like I’ve lost myself, I’m not me anymore. I’ve given up on everything I’ve ever wanted in life. The company I keep, the people I’m surrounded by just take me for granted. Someone I’m “friends with in the year below me in college, who just joined and has no other friends, was messaging me just now and I told her I’ll always be here for her she can message me anytime. She replied you should also be there for me at school too. I try to be nice and be the friend she needed a and she treats me like this? I can’t be in the college all the time, my other friends just ignore me and make me feel lonely so I try to get away. I try to help everyone because I don’t want them to ever feel how I feel. I’ve only ever trusted one person to talk to about this and because of the way people make me feel when I help them, I feel like I make him feel like that too, so as much as I want to talk to him because i know I’ll feel better, I don’t want home to think I’m annoying him or I’m a burden. 

I wake up wishing I was dead and go to sleep wishing I was dead. I can’t escape and it won’t stop. I try so hard everyday and for what? I don’t see myself ever feeling happy, in fact I don’t even remember what happy is. All I want is to vent to the one person I trust in my life but I feel like such a burden. If I’m going to be a burden, I’m going to be my own burden. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I can kill myself because it would feel like I’m disappointing the person who unknowingly saved my life. All I’m doing is existing and that’s more draining than actually feeling anything."

I started drinking and smoking a lot more. Just couldn't get the feeling of being unwanted and unloved out of my mind. When I'm with friends, I'm semi happy. It gets my mind off of everything.  From her betrayal and cheating, to no one seeming to believe me, things just got worse. Last year it got so bad and hard to deal with, I tried to drink myself to death. I developed an ""I dont care anymore"" attitude. I lost my job because i just didnt care enough to get out of bed to do anything. I've had a one date and a couple matches on bumble but nothing ever pans out. I'm left alone all over again. And the only person in the world I could talk to, who actually understood what I was going thru, my grandmother, passed a couple months ago.  Things had started looking up and it seemed like I was starting to do better, but since then, I just cant stop feeling completely alone.

We haven’t been together for that long and I already feel like I’m getting really attached and scared that I will push her away, even though it’s obvious that she feels the same about me. I haven’t been in any relationships ever before this. I always kept to myself. I’ve hung out with her and her big family 2 weekends in a row so it’s obvious that she likes me too, but I can’t stop making up scenarios in my head and it’s getting to me. I like her a lot but I’m such a jealous person, I think that comes from not having a lot of experience in relationships. I find myself trying to please her and tell her things that I think she wants to hear. But this is all on top of me getting fired from my job last week, so all together right now I feel really shitty about myself even though I have her. I don’t want her to think I’m some kind of loser that doesn’t know what he’s doing. Idk I just had to rant. Thank you."

teenonasaturdaynight,2021-09-07 19:06:56+00:00,i don't know exactly how i feel," Right now I kind of feel numb but at the same time I feel very overwhelmed too but I don't know what I am feeling. Also, even though I am not clinically diagnosed , I feel like I have been suffering depression from the past year but the thing is that I find ways to tell myself otherwise. I feel like I am manipulating myself into making me think that I am suffering from depression, like the whatever I feel is invalid because I might be imitating whatever I've seen from the internet or tv shows. But then I also feel like I am not in control of my thoughts, like I am just making things up. It's hard to explain. I feel like I don't have a personality so much so that I am hyper aware of what I am thinking ( maybe it's because I have too much time in my hands to waste since I'm not doing anything productive). I am so aware of what I am thinking that I have to explain and assess it right after I have thought the thought. It's like a battle within my head. In the beginning, there were feelings of sadness and desperation but now I feel like I don't care at all, there is nothing that makes me happy. For a moment I do worry but the next moment I just give up worrying maybe its because I'm exhausted but I'm not even trying. Apparently just existing itself exhausting. I do laugh and have a good days, I'm not a complete stone, but after I do that it goes back to how it was and then I fall into a debate within myself whether whatever I am feeling is real or am I just faking it. It's a never ending cycling. I want it to stop. I feel like I am attacking myself. I feel hopeless"

Last year, I was diagnosed with GERD and was just recently diagnosed with gastroparesis (delayed stomach digestion). I've lost weight and look like a skeleton bc my diet has become very limited. Luckily though, it hasn't got to the point where I am on a feeding tube. On top of physical ailments, I have debilitating OCD, anxiety, and suspect I might have undiagnosed PTSD. I also am autistic so heightened sensitivity to noise is getting bad too. The logical conclusion to me is to just go get therapy. Wrong. Nobody takes my insurance and I've been turned away several times because of it. It doesn't seem to matter to them that the patient is very sick as long as they are poor. So, I've been dealing with the situation on my own, without a therapist and it's getting to the point where I just don't even have the will to get out of bed. I'm not feeling blue so much as I'm feeling a mind-numbing hollow emptiness. 

Can anyone relate, how do you cope? How do you keep getting up everyday even though the will to live is so slim?

They've raised you to be this amazing person and half of the time, you don't meet their expectations head on. Its like hitting a brick wall of sorts. The wall representing depression and the disappointment from your parents. 

You see, my parents aren't the best. My dad is an alcoholic who regularly drink-drives and my mum is a hard working independent woman who has the shittiest teenager verbal skills known to man.

My mum says thstvshe knows me, and yet she barely remembers my name half of the time. Sometimes she will just blatantly ignore me and it hurts like a motherfucker.

There have even been times where I say to my mum ""I love you"" and she's just responded with ""bog off"" as a joke. She's done it so many times that she doesn't even realise that at which point it hurts. 

I may be overreacting but it is literally driving my to suicide. I can't keep up with this shit. There is nothing worse than seeing that your mum/dad are disappointed in you and it hurts like a motherfucker."
Potential-Breath7273,2021-09-07 13:06:15+00:00,I'm 24 but I haven't grown since 15 &amp; no one treats me like a man or takes me seriously,"Edit~ I didn't realize I typed an essay lol. Anyone that reads to the end for me I appreciate beyond words

Ok so to start, I'm 24yo male &amp; straight, single. I'm 5'8"" and I haven't grown or changed whatsoever since I was about 15 or 16. I'm pretty skinny and scrawny and have been since around then, usually about 105lbs-130lbs. And worst of all to me is my voice hasn't changed and i legitimately sound like a young teenager. Enough people have already been up front with me about that..
And see that wasn't even something I paid attention to or even noticed until a good few years ago. Back then at age 13-15 I was one of the biggest kids and it was great because nobody ever fucked with me &amp; let's be honest, that's exactly how this era works lmao. I never fucked with or tried to bully anyone with my size. It was smooth up until I'd say about sophomore year when all the other guys starting growing past my point and eventually way past my point. And with that around then or junior year I noticed I started getting treated different by the average guy and it didnt take too long before I understood that they're looking down on me and giving that ""he doesn't seem like a man"" vibe. An example could be like say it's you and 2 or 3 other guys and you're trying to talk and connect with them but when you open your mouth and start speaking in the same tone, they'll just stop paying attention to you and pay attention to whomever else is talking at the same tone. Showing way more emotion to them, when they're just blank and emotionless the few seconds while I was talking.
By senior year I noticed it started coming from girls too, and that's when it really starting hitting me bad and tearing down my confidence and anxiety. I forgot to mention that I've always had Bradyphrenia so I think &amp;  I talk slower than most people, so I've never been the most interesting to talk to but most people usually still gave me the patience. But that finally started catching up with me around senior year it really seemed. It came to where pretty much no one ever tried to talk to me anymore the rest of highschool besides my only 2 friends. 
After I graduated and entered adult life it's been the worst and most obvious since then, my family and couple of friends would never say it of course, but there's been just enough other people constantly being honest with me about my masculinity and voice compared to men my age. There's been a couple of times when my I.D was claimed fake because I didn't look ""18"" when I was 20 the first time that happened. And that happened more than once, what does that tell you?? And one more important thing is I have always put my all into trying to be masculine. I poke my chest out, I try to match tones when I talk, i try to have that ""tough and carelessness"" in my personality I'm sure you know what I mean. But I still was hit hard with not being taken seriously by nearly everyone in society and it's got so much worse the older I get, and now dudes my age are most over 6"" or over 5""10 but they're also literally double my size in arms, legs, chest everything. Like someone half your age. And most are really convinced I'm a kid at first. So when they learn my real age, they treat me even less. My last gf in 2019 never could seem to treat me like a man either told me a few times she can't take me seriously, then I asked her if all this was why and she said yes.  It's all hit me so fucking hard at this point that I just gave up all the effort of trying to be masculine over a year ago. I can say that I have absolutely no confidence. I have no point or reason to anymore its completely effortless. I've been treated exactly the same since then regardless if I try and that hit me really hard too.
It's more than obvious that this is true about me at this point. I'm convinced that I don't have a chance. It's made it just as hard to get a job and keep a job idk which is harder.. it's come to where I cant work around anyone anymore because I cant handle it. I notice every single time, 99% of whoever I talk to. There's always this rare gem here and there that doesn't care about appearance, but even some of them have agreed and said they don't know what I should do. My mom was the only one keeping me alive for a long time she was everything to me and the only one who gave me unconditional love and everything but she died in May from cancer. And I'm just ready to go now. I have no faith that this will ever change.. how could it. I'm a man in a child's body. I know that at this point I'll never get a good friend or a beautiful woman. This is the opposite of a good hearted era. You are what you eat. Obviously, that's what everyone goes by. I get treated like a chihuahua to a pitbull all day long. I can't take it anymore... Im not allowed to be anything I want to be. Let's be completely honest, no woman will want a ""man"" that's treated and confused for a kid by everyone. Not to mention no masculinity to be attracted to. To make it even better, my d**k is small. 
I just don't see any chance of me ever being happy again.. im scared to die because im scared of being alone. But all I want is to be with my mom or just not participate this world either way. I dont belong here. 
I just wanna know what someone else would do... I need help. I dont know where I would ever begin from here."

I don't know what is going on and what to do."
SoupRonin,2021-09-07 05:33:48+00:00,It's the same every year. Sorry for the lengthy post.,"I've been struggling for so long now but I think last month was the tipping point for me. I turned 30 last month and I had a bad bday. Bdays have been bad since I was a teen. Mostly cause I never had any friends to invite. I never had a friend over for a party or invite me somewhere. I never received a gift from someone that was outside of my family. It was always just my family. And I don't like my family. they've always refused to see how bad I've been suffering from depression and anxiety. They always thought it was some kind of excuse to not be a functioning adult. I never ask for anything for my bday cause I just feel like I don't deserve anything. So I always get stuff I don't want and I have to play it off as if I like it. Idk about you all but it sucks asking for nothing but getting stuff you never even wanted in the first place.

For the longest time, I've had only this 1 friend that I've desperately try to keep around. We have known each other for 11 years. She and I suffer from similar situations, so I always felt like I could talk to her. I've always had feelings for her too. We have talked about it, but we live a state away from each other so I never really pursued it in fear of being rejected. I don't think she feels as strongly as I do for her though, and moving by myself to be closer to her and discovering it was a bad idea would most likely end me. As pathetic as that sounds. We have gotten mad at each other in the past and drifted away. Happened last year around this time. And also 6 years ago. But we always seem to end up finding each other again end up talking again like it was nothing. I always thought that meant something. I've struggled to make and to keep friends but she always seemed to come back or accept me. Idk if that's a healthy relationship but I'm too lonely to dwell on it. I always feel so empty when she's not around.

She has been distancing herself from me lately. and I finally found out why tonight. She is in a relationship now. That hurt to find out. Like really bad. I know I'll be losing her now. And I have basically. We use to hang out and talk for hours. Now we haven't talked for over a month. And I know why. She basically found someone better. I just can't go through this again. I really wanna just erase her from my mind but I just can't. I've had bad thoughts for a while now, but I always kept them in order. but lately, these thoughts have just escalated. I just wanna feel happiness. I wanna feel like I can trust someone and not be pushed away when I need them the most. I wanna feel good about myself. I don't wanna be alone anymore. I wish I could see a future where I will finally feel all that. Sadly I don't."

But I’m just curious… How do you think it is?"
Spacetalks3114,2021-09-07 03:48:48+00:00,How depression started to radicalize me. Part 1:,"I always considered myself someone who did good for the world. From a young age, I use to be an optimist and an empathetic person. I was the type of person who befriended the ""weird"" kid at school, and always did what I thought was right. And I did those things, not expecting anything in return, but because I thought if I helped others, it would create a ripple affect of positivity and make the world a happier place, even if on a small scale. Altruism gave me intrinsic value because knowing I helped others made me feel like I had a purpose.

However, while I use to feel good helping people in the moment, existential depression changed that and I no longer felt any happiness from altruism. My worldview also began to change as well. In fact, I began to only see only the negatives in both people and in myself.

And how this particular depression occurred, well, there's lots of reasons for that. It was many past traumas/societal expectations that were slowly rising over the years. Until about a year ago did it completely boil over when I finally admitted to myself that I am ugly.

Life is interesting. Especially in your 18-29s. It's the time of your life when you're leaving highschool, going to college, joining the workforce, expected to have a home, expected to be financial stable, and overall have your life put together.

And that's only for extrinsic gain. 

Society also expects you to hit many intrinsic milestones between those ages as well. Child bearing, getting married/dating, knowing who you are, having a good grasp on how to climb the social ladder, having great social skills, and many more.

Arguably, I'd say it's probably the most confusing time in your life, above your teenage years. As teenagers can oftentimes rely on parents to provide the basic necessities, young adults don't really have that luxury. All while struggling with identity issues, a search for meaning, and figuring out a way to make ends meet.

While, there are many typical expectations of young adults, there's one glaring issue that doesn't really seem to be talked about as much. And that is, people leaving your life.

For me, growing up, I was told my professors would be a pain in the ass, that bosses would be unforgiving, and to study hard to make something of myself.

But one thing that I wasn't told was simply how lonely it would be. Not just in the aspect of college or academically, but the fact that people leave your life, and they leave fast. A natural part of growing up.

In the time period 18-29, most of the people you know would leave your life. The guy you dated all throughout highschool, to the girl you were best friends with, they leave too. They leave, not because you are bad, but because they are figuring themselves out and life has a way taking people in other directions.

However, because you are depressed, you don't really see it that way. You start to see it as a personal attack rather than life just taking people in other directions. And because of that, you start to ask yourself questions like ""If everyone leaves, then am I the problem?"" ""Is it them?"" ""If it's them, then why be a moral person?"" And you begin to dehumanize them. You begin to see them as the enemy. You see them as this because they left you, so it must be personal as to why they left. And this killed me inside for the longest time. I hated people for leaving me, but secretly loved and missed them.

The reality is, it's probably not personal. It's just life taking your former support system in other directions. And it's hard. People leaving you is hard. Albeit, necessary for the process of adulthood and the maturation into a well adjusted person. Though, you don't see it like that while being depressed.

Depression convinces you that it is a personal attack, that life is terrible, and that there will be no happy future. And to confirm your biases, you start to seek out groups that reaffirm these beliefs. 

These groups are oftentimes predatory in nature, taking advantage of your need for belonging and validation. These groups are quite dangerous and can very often radicalize you in ways that you didn't expect. You go in wanting belonging and come out with much more sinister and dangerous beliefs of people and the world alike. The short term is feeling included, but in return, you have to sell your very identity and core beliefs.

A major problem is, it's hard to see it that way while going through it. From the perspective of depression, it feels like you're being enlightened to reality, while the most accurate truth is a mixture of ""there's both good and bad in the world."" Where's there's people dying, there's also people being born, while humanity is responsible for most of the harm on the earth, humanity has also made tons of medical advancements to save others/animals. It's a grey area. Humanity, the world, the universe is a grey area. Knowledge is put forth, it's your job as what to do with that knowledge. If you're depressed, you'll probably take that knowledge and apply it in a negative way. And or seek out negative studies, articles, news, to help confirm your already bleak worldview/view of others. This can be dangerous to your mental health and unproductive.

What also began to happen to me was my pain started to make me feel special. Rather than feeling a sense of pride in my achievements, I started to feel a sense of pride in my pain. That no one else seems to understand how cruel and bad the world is. And that I am enlightened in some twisted way because I saw ""the truth."" And ""the truth"" is simply ""the world is bad and unfair."" Which again, is not completely false, but it's not completely accurate either.

So yeah, there's so much more to my story and I'm not just depressed because of these specific issues. (I'm getting really tired tonight and don't have time to keep writing.) So I wrote this because I thought maybe someone else could relate, I do plan to make another few parts/lessons I've learned, things to do to help you understand your depression, etc. But for now, hopefully someone out there can relate to this and can maybe understand themselves better. I don't know. Good night.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I might edit this not sure if it'll make sense or not as it was a quick write up."
wiltingflower25,2021-09-07 03:04:10+00:00,I need to vent. Feeling alone,"Im always alone. And I feel alone even if im with people. I never have been able to understand why people aren't drawn to me even if I do my best to make a connection. I always feel people speak to me when they need something from me, not to have a genuine connection or conversation. I have struggled with self hate for almost my entire life- along with coping with my perfectionism which combined is extremely toxic. For a long time I couldn't acknowledge it, and when I did I wasn't ready to try and change it. But more recently over the past few years I have started trying. I want to be a better person. I always go out of my way, and even do things against my own interests, to help someone. I dont ever expect anything from it, but its still sad when I give so much and at the end of the day I'm waving goodbye to those I give to while I stand alone. It makes me feel internally worthless. Which feeds the self hate demons I try to fight so hard against. Im now realizing im jusy rambling on now. I guess the loneliness is getting to me tonight and I wanted to share. Be able to open up to literally anyone."

Expiredmeds,2021-09-06 23:57:14+00:00,Hello I’m Ron,I’m now 20 and don’t have much to show for it. My depression is only getting worse and some days I can’t even get myself out of the bed. I’m in my second year of college and still don’t know what to do in life. I know I have to start by researching careers that interest me but I can’t get myself to do it. I don’t know what is wrong with me. Everytime I decide I’m going to start my homework/ other stuff for school I just lose interest and put it off for later. I endlessly scroll though Reddit and Instagram trying to distract my brain from these thoughts. I do not have a job right now but I’m looking and applying everywhere. I have 6K in savings. But that’s all the money I have to my name. My college is paid for by federal aid as I come from a poor family. I look around and see everyone else having fun being successful/making money and happy. I’m happy for them but it makes me a little jealous and sad. I also look and see that everyone has one thing that they are passionate about and peruse. I can’t say that about myself. I don’t have any role models or any mentors. I don’t know if I’m just lazy or if it’s actually something wrong with me. I’m tired of feeling like a burden and a useless waste of space.

What are your thoughts?","Well, I'm not fan of existing and remembering that I'm living makes me want to vomit. Nevertheless, realizing any action feels kinda ""wrong"" or conflicting since everything is too meaningless to do. This question is for the people who thinks that they need to suicide because of the ""everything is meaningless"" principle."

I don't want to kill myself, but i wanted to how much i can go in before something really bad could happen. I already tried cutting myself a bit, but  I've seen that the vein is pretty deep beneath the skin. And how much time would i have to get to the hospital. I kinda really hate my life at this point but i know it will get better but i need some info. I did cut myself in the past pretty ugly on the upper leg but always put stiches on it and took care of it. I want to do it the smart way. I know it sounds stupid but for me it's not about killing myself. Thanks for the info!"

It always hurts so much worse when it doesn’t work out than it would’ve been to just stay stuck in that rut. Even when it felt too overwhelming for me, I wanted to push through that and see if things could change. They seemed like they might be genuine so I really tried believe me I did, but then they end up ghosting me and talking about me behind my back. 

I just don’t see things ever changing anymore. Idk how many times I can be hurt by people, no one seems to give a shit about anything. Doesn’t matter how they make people feel because it’s not their problem."

However since the last few days i have been feeling extremely depressed. The girl i liked and always wanted to end up with got married a couple of months ago and has now moved abroad, another girl who i like in my current university is already married and i go bowling with her along with her husband. i recently got into an argument with my best friend and ended up breaking up the friendship, going to work feels like an enormous waste of time and i have no short term prospects of better employment, untill i complete my llb and start at entry level once again. most legal jobs dont pay initially anyway. all of  a sudden i felt extremely lonely and had no one to share this with, thats why i am posting here, if someone has gone through something similar, any advice on how to go about things from here on is highly welcome."
MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-06 14:02:01+00:00,I’m feeling so destructively angry outta nowhere and I don’t know why.,"It’s like the worst fucking frustrated anger I’ve ever experienced. I was just trying to cut up fucking chicken breast for my dinner and the knife wasn’t sharp enough so the chicken kept sliding under it and I just fucking lost it, stabbed the chicken over and over and over again just totally outta nowhere. Every time I pick something up I have the overwhelming urge to crush it in my hand or throw it at the wall. 

Had the overwhelming urge to grab the metal of the fry pan after I was finished cooking it too. I did grab it, but it only really burned for a few seconds before the temperature of my hand and the pan started to meet in the middle and it was just warm. I don’t even know why I wanted to do it, doing it didn’t even satisfy anything but maybe it’s cause it didn’t do permanent damage. 

Im glad there’s no one around me right now, I just wanna scream at someone. Not sure I could actually stop myself. I don’t even know where it came from, it just bubbled up from nowhere. I mean, I’m always suicidally depressed, and I’ve been even lower in the pit than usual for the past month or so but fuck, this just jumped into my head.

I don’t know why the fuck I feel like this or what the fuck to do about it. Wish I had something to fucking break."
BarbatosLupusAmazonz,2021-09-06 12:48:12+00:00,Being cut off from a good friend….,"I lost a very good &amp; close friend recently(not death related, but we “broke up” badly”). We met @ work, and she left shortly after to become a police officer in my country. Before she left, I used to ask her for advice on a crush i had, and I repaid her w an dinner outing, and she confided in me as well. After that first outing, we’ve met almost every week, either by going out or me going to her house w her favourite tarts &amp; drinks. As all of these were going on, I unintentionally liked her. And I stupidly ran my mouth around my workplace asking for advice. &amp; so a month ago, she heard about it, and confronted me over text. And she muted me ever since on WhatsApp. 
The reason I fell for her: she’s the 1st girl to ever give me the time &amp; space in her life to let me do things w her and confide deeply In each other. And I screwed it up. 

I wanna rekindle this friendship but idk how to….."
misterbeansbeans,2021-09-06 12:00:23+00:00,i’m sorry for taking your time if you read this,"I don’t want to take up anyone’s time so i won’t make this too long. 

my life seriously has not been too great for a while, last year my girlfriend (of 3 years) and i split which sent me into a spiral of emotions. In feb. of 2020, i started working as a delivery driver with my best friend in the world. little did i know, the place was full of horrible influences, and a lot of people with drug connections. I’ve always liked psychedelics and never had an issue with them (2017-2021), but i never thought i would have the issues that i have today. molly and ecstasy have been an issue for months on end, and i didn’t realize it until my ex and i started talking again (may 22nd, 2021). it was probably the best days of our friendship/relationship, no fights- just us, happy at last. then she went on vacation, i decided to have fun at work one day, then the next, and the day after that. each day i (thought would be a good idea) to take 10 ecstasy pills, which led to june 7th, i overdosed at work in my car. 

after all that, my ex blocked me and refuses to see me again. she hangs out with my friends and is going to all of the plans i made, just so i have issues going. my best friend who i worked with, quit his job the next day and i haven’t seen/talked to him since. he said that “what happened scarred him” and he was mad i never said ‘thank you’ for helping IN the moment- even though i profusely thanked him up and down for hours on end. ive tried to take my own life since then by drinking and mixing what i could find, substance wise, and i wish either of those times worked. i quit my job 2.5 weeks ago and my rent is due on the 25th, i’m running low on my savings &amp; im panicking, i’m also forcing myself to detox from weed and everything in between- i realize i need to help my mental &amp; having crutches along the way just won’t help. 

starting my job in february, i weighed 177lbs @ 5’ 11”. today, i’m 135lbs, still 5’ 11” (lost weight was june 15th - 121 lbs. i know what i need to do to get better, i just think taking the easy way out would be, well, easier. i didn’t go to college so i have no career, i don’t have a S.O or friends so i don’t really go out much or have any motivation. i’m constantly wanting to get fucked up and numb myself. 

i don’t have insurance or the money to go to a doctor or psychiatrist, but my old boss (psych major) thought i had sever bipolar and ‘2’ types of OCD, i didn’t know there was more than one. he said relationship and harmful- whatever that means. i want help but i’m afraid i’ll abuse the medication too. 

it’s like i’m constantly fighting myself and digging this hole deeper just because i don’t know how to properly help myself. it’s been so long since somebody has texted or called me and asked how i was doing. it feels like nobody cares anymore, like i don’t matter. 

i’m just running out of time before my roommates (brother and uncle) find out i’m not working, i saved up enough for a month of rent + a car payment &amp; a few insurance bills, but it’s just not enough. 

i’m sorry for rambling but, i haven’t let anything out in so long that i’m sitting here bawling my eyes out @ 7:50 am on a damn monday. i don’t know what to do anymore besides give up

i’m also sorry if i put anything in here that shouldn’t have been- it’s my first post on reddit in over a year and a half since making my account. i just really can’t hold my words and feelings back anymore, i miss having someone to be here, through the good and bad"

DryCoast,2021-09-06 07:56:51+00:00,I don't want to make friends in college,"I almost never enjoyed hanging out with people. I used to be socially awkward in high school and wanted to make friends. Then in college i did make friends and thought ""this is it?"" seriously, that's all it is? It's not exciting or fun to hang out with people. I mean idk really nothing is exciting to me because of depression, but something about being with others just isn't fun. I'd rather be drawing. So that's what I'm going to do. I'm tired of trying to force myself to be someone else. I'm just someone who doesn't talk to others. I wasn't in high school when I was socially awkward. now I'm not socially awkward but I still feel I way overhyped the idea of having friends. I mean who am I kidding there's been so many people I befriended then never spoke to again. I have this close friend that I haven't been talking to and I don't even miss. I'm such a prick, or maybe it's because I'm depressed and don't bond with people. Or it's probably both

I swear though I've been walking by myself with my music through campus and the city I'm at and it's the greatest thing ever. I love being that loner kept to herself walking by a bunch of people. I love that independence. I'm not alone, I keep myself company. That's how it feels. I feel like I'm there for myself and that's who I want to be with. I love this sort of company. I love taking walks by myself &lt;3 it makes me feel so much better. being that person who is wildly independent and keeps to herself, idk I love that. I've been so quiet this first week at college and I absolutely love this. I love this sort of persona. I feel like I can truly be myself when I'm like this. I'm quiet right now and for some reason I love it to death. I think I might just be myself and stick to this. Because for the past few years I feel like I was sacrificing myself to do something I didn't think was particularly exciting. Imma use this year to experiment, to be very independent while I have this newfound confidence. Before I was quiet and socially awkward, but now I want to try being that person who is quiet but confident. To have that confidence to maybe one day go to a sports game alone and fucking enjoy it because i will"

All I really want to do is draw whatever I like drawing. I don't draw what other people want me to draw and I don't take commission. Drawing whatever I like is one of the very few things I'm passionate about... and yet I can't do this for a living. I really want to though. Makes me envy other artists like musicians. Do I get fucking jealous of musicians. They can create whatever music they want and sing about whatever they wish and they can at least make a little money off of it, if not make a full time living. If I produce even a little bit of art that I want to make then it's pretty much a guarantee I won't make anything. If I try to do it full time then fuck me I guess I won't make a dime probably. It really sucks being someone who draws. Even if you want to work for a company you probably won't make enough of a living anyway. I really wish I was never interested in art. I wish I was born interested in making TV shows or making music because at least then I could have a higher chance of make a living doing what I love doing"

It just doesn’t feel worth going though a million awful rejections to possibly find one decent girl… besides now even if I want a romantic relationship I’m not good for anyone.

They abused me until DCF finally came to take me out of the house. I was placed into a foster family whom I loved and cared for but now it doesn’t seem like they do feel the same for me and if they do it’s not as deep as normal parents would which I guess is understandable since I’m not their real daughter. I live in my boyfriends parents house right now but I don’t think it’s going to work. I do not think he sees me as a girlfriend or a partner but just as someone he pities because of my life. I have no friends. I’m a college student and I work but I don’t know how I’ll be able to afford rent if I move out of my boyfriend’s parents house. But at this point, I don’t think life is worth living anymore as I feel lonely with no really real family or friends. Why me? I am alone. I don’t want pity. I just feel tired and drained and lonely in this world. I don’t want to be pitied but this all seems so pointless. I have no one in life who is steady in my life.

Last night my roommate asked me to come to a party and I got really drunk I hated it there all these kids holding their beers and somehow enjoying themselves. After the cops shut it down me and the group I came with who I only knew about three of them went to the town and split up. Now I was at a pizza place with two girls and two guys I didn’t know. I guess they could tell I was really out of it and thought it would be funny to fuck with me so they all just kept lying about everything we were talking about (where they were from, their names, what they were studying and what classes they were in) and when I caught on I felt like everything in the world was fake and I didn’t know anything; these kids I had been talking to and hanging out with all night somehow made a pact to fuck with me completely. And the thing is if I were one of them and saw this drunk little freak with me I would do the same thing out of amusing myself. Anyways when we got on campus I was getting mad that the two girls kept lying to me and when they got defensive I cursed them out and they used that as a way to walk away and make me look like a freak. The two guys still kept walking with me and assuring me the girls were shitty but they were now being “real” with me and liked me and all that shit. Then I find out all this shit about them that made me unable to trust anything they said all night and shoved one of them and wanted to fight them, or just get beat up. I just kept shouting at the and cursing and calling them phonies and was crying like shit. Sorry for the rant. Anyways remember how I told I made friends but now they think I’m shitty. Well we were hanging out for a while in a short time period, it’s these two girls and one guy and I really liked them. But the other night when we were drinking and just ducking around I said something that they took a very wrong way and I don’t completely blame them but I realized they were not texting me anymore or wanted to hang out recently so I texted one of the girls asking her if I did something and after explaining in a very very long text trying to tell her so that she wouldn’t be mad at me but I could tell she was still really uncomfortable and my other two friends (one being her roommate) also felt that way. Now I have no friends here and I can’t talk to people because I’m so fucking weird talking to people and I can’t ducking change this one thing I said to the friends that I really liked and I knew they really liked me until one ducking shitty fucken thing I can’t do this anymore I really can’t I every moment is dreadful I can’t take it I have no one to vent to so I’m on fkn Reddit looking for someone to tell me it’s all ok the only person I like is a girl I know online who we talk about music and all this stuff we have in common but all the people I know in real life hate me or I cant be around them without throwing up fkn shit."

Zoey1000000,2021-09-06 01:33:41+00:00,Done.,"I’m 14 and my mom is abusive. I don’t really know where to start, but this has been happening ever since 2020. It seems that my mom hates me. Last November ( the day before thanksgiving) I was helping out in the kitchen cause I liked cooking with my mom. I was making pumpkin pie and older sister was down there on her phone. My dad was talking to my mom sitting at the island. My mom handed me a piece of paper and said “Do this recipe instead of the can recipe”, but the only problem was that I already started doing the can recipe. Like I already added the eggs and stuff. I thought that I could still continue to make the pumpkin pie, but with another recipe. So I did and when I was done the batter looked very watery. I showed my mom and she snapped. She just lost it. She didn’t tell yet, but my dad started asking questions or just trying to make conversation and my mom gave him ALL attitude and was very aggressive saying stuff like “ can’t you see I’m doing something blah blah blah” you get the point. My dad knowing how my mom is got up and went to the room cause he didn’t want to start something further. My mom begin to criticize my sister for being down stairs and not doing anything, but the thing about my sister is that she really doesn’t spend family time. So her being down stairs was a good enough treat to me anyway. Then when my sister was leaving she started to yell at me about the pie so I just left with my sister. About a hour later my mom literally left the house cause everything has to be about her. She left came back about a hour later. Thanksgiving was trash. She ruined the whole vibe. The only person she talked to was my dad. Maybe like 2 days later we put up the Christmas tree and she was still salty. Still ain’t say anything to me or my sister. My brain blocked out most of the shifty things she done to me last year so I don’t rly remember but at one time she the same year so in December she said she didn’t do anything wrong in the situation and how we ruined the vibe. I tried to take my life around 20+ times last year, but of course no ones knows that. Fast forward to about March of 2021. My mental health is still bad. Me and my mom fought about someone I don’t remember what it was but she kept a attitude with me. When I was doing school work one of the days she yelled like YELLED  I reacted fast so I started getting defensive before she could even say anything. Big mistake. She started yelling at me for getting defensive and than she lunged at me (keep in mind I didn’t touch her) she lunged at me and the only thing protecting me was myself. She said “what are you going to do”. I said “ defend myself”. She proceeded to say “ defend yo self bitch” walking away going to her room. She slammed the door but I could still hear her. She got the gun. I could hear her loading something. Or it was a clicking noise. I knew. We have a M-9. I didn’t know what to do. So I got up and went to my back yard. Where I proceeded to cry and stay out there for 2 hours. I went back inside cause it started to rain. My dad came home and yelled at me cause my mom brain washing him. He started saying I’m not allowed to show emotion cause I’m a child. My mom went up in my room started trying to fight me. Like fist fight. I broke down I just wanted to do my school work and die. Then hours later My mom then went in my room hours later to SAGE IT. She didn’t save her room, but she saged my room. Our relationship hasn’t been the same since.I wish her and my dad got a divorce cause my dad is such a loving and caring person and she’s a whole ASS witch. She treats my dad like trash. Yes they’ve been married for 18 years but that doesn’t mean there happy. As bad as it sounds I kinda wish my mom died. She just sucks, but the next time I’m home alone I’m gonna get the gun and shoot myself. I cannot take it anymore. I can’t be here for another 4 years. I can’t do it. I’m already failing my classes and it’s only the 1st month of school. It sucks because my life was actually starting to look up but I know this happiness won’t last forever. Goodbye and thanks for listening to my story."

Every year I spend my birthday with less and less people. Today I couldn’t even spend it with my dad since he decided it would be better to be with his girlfriend.

peanut_-_,2021-09-05 22:34:24+00:00,Why shouldn't I die? Nothing's stopping me? I don't know what title suits this best,"""All I want is to have autonomy and choice regarding my own body. All I want is to die with dignity. All I want is to rest in peace. Why is that too much to ask?""

Let's take religion out of the picture. The existence of religion is subjective. Nothing more, nothing less. 

Family - everyone starts there as a reason. I guess it's because people believe everyone has a good relationship with their mothers, and fathers, sisters and brothers. If that's not the case, it can always ""be fixed"". It can always improve. With divorced parents, a self centered mother and a sister that talks to me once a year, I don't see anything changing. I wouldn't feel guilt leaving them because they didn't feel guilt about abandoning me. Extended family have also made it clear that I do not belong - most of them don't acknowledge my existence. The ones that do take the Mickey out of me. 

I don't have friends. I don't plan on getting friends. I find it tiring to have to move my lips to talk, much less type or anything similar. Countless, horrible, experiences with people were enough to get the message through. Relying on people to give me strength or happiness is a surefire way to experience disappointment. An inability for them to understand - regardless of what they've been through - and a failure for me to understand them makes the entire thing null. If I had the energy, I probably would hate everybody. 

Someone told me that I should live for the ""beautiful things in life"". Beautiful things that fall short to the sufferings of life. Someone else told me that ""pleasure is derived from suffering. to feel full would mean you had to be hungry. to be warm means you had to be cold. to feel comfort means you would have to feel the bitterness of isolation"". I don't think the small, ephemeral pleasures of life could ever make suffering seem worth it. I don't see how the party life at 21 - friendships, alcohol, sex, recklessness - will ever be worth the next 50 years of hard labour - labour that for the average person will never be rewarded. I don't see how the ""beautiful things in life"" will ever negate the horrible suffering of growing old and gray - watching the people that carry the only memories of you.. in actuality, watching yourself die before you do yourself. I don't know how years of pity from those younger than you, constant misunderstanding, isolation, pain, fatigue, medication, and a plethora of other things will ever justify existing in the first place. Nevermind the suffering and pain I'm in at the moment.

Potential children? The guilt I would feel bringing a beautiful little girl, or a charming boy (or other) into this world would kill me in of itself. I would never be able to live with myself knowing I subject someone - someone who did nothing to me - constant suffering. Constant questioning about the meaning of life, only to find out that their only purpose was to satisfy my needs. Even if that wasn't the case, the meaninglessness of it all, the pain of it all, the overwhelming badness of the world inside and outside their head would never be worth it.

Self improvement? It's suicide awareness month right now. September. Spreading information about suicidal people, telling them it's not selfish, helping them feel accepted. A lot of suicidal people would love that. To feel accepted. To feel understood. I'd imagine a lot of suicidal people constantly reach out for help - suicide attempts, cutting, telling people and so on. A lot of those people want a better existence. For ""the pain to stop"". A lot of them have an aspiration for something; hope that they can look up to and say ""This is what I want"", regardless of how tall the ladder is to reach it. Suicide prevention, therapy, counseling, drugs, inspirational quotes - all of which would help them, most probably. All of which are tailored to them. What about the people that dread waking up every morning? What about the people that don't have an idea of what they want, because the mere process of thinking is intoxicating? What about the people who dread the existence of heaven because it means they would have to live for an eternity? The people like me who would still off themselves if they had all the fortune in the world, or non at all? Who had love and relationships and family and children, but would still kill themselves because the idea of having to breathe...

I should get ready soon.."

AlanFMaj7,2021-09-05 17:42:13+00:00,I can't stand this anymore,"Hi, my birthday is in a few days (Sept 10th) so I'll be 22 soon and I feel nothing but emptiness and pain. I've been dealing with depression since I have 15, and I just can't stand it anymore.

My depression is result of a lot of things, since kid I remember my parents always fighting, I was victim of bullying from school to high school, and relationships haven't been great neither if they can be called ""relationships"". Can't leave out that, of course, I had no friends. 

Even though I have a few ""friends"" now it feels like I'm completely alone in this world and the pandemic has only made it worse. The only reason why I haven't killed myself is because I don't want my family to suffer my lost. 

In top of that, my family wants to celebrate my birthday and invite my relatives, and I just feel so miserable but I'll have to tell them that I just wanna be alone in my room that day. 

I don't even know why I'm posting this here, It's awful to say that knowing if there's someone out there who is suffering like me will make me feel better, I don't wish this to anyone.

I guess I just wanted to get it out of my chest"
MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-05 17:19:55+00:00,"Realistically, why does it actually matter if I kill myself?","I’m not trying to be edgy or use this as some kinda masked cry for help, I’m just genuinely trying to understand why it’s a thing that every time I make a post or something about being suicidal, people always seem to wanna prevent me from doing anything about it. Why?  What’s so bad about it? What difference does it even make, realistically? I really don’t get it.

I don’t have anyone I’d be leaving behind that would suffer because of it, lived my entire life as a very solitary person and have nothing really to do with my family and haven’t for a long time now. And it’s not like I’m so like crucial pillar of the community and the world would crumble and burn without me in it. No one would even notice, it would change exactly nothing about anyone’s lives. 

And people are gonna say it’s just my belief and I’m sure people are gonna disagree just cause of how they need to see the world in order to tolerate living in it, but there’s absolutely zero evidence to suggest that everyone has a “purpose” or “everything happens for a reason” or any of those other hopeful platitudes. It’s just people who wanna believe that things will always get better or find their place, but millions upon millions of people never do, they just live and then they die and at no point during that time did they achieve any kind of purpose or reach any state of existential fulfilment. They just lived, then they died and that was that.

So no friends, no family, or anyone else to leave behind, no real reason to be here outside of that either, no destiny or predetermined purpose I need to see through, and I’m also really not having a good time. So if I was to up and decide tomorrow that I’ve seen and done enough, why does that even matter?"

Chummy42o,2021-09-05 16:21:23+00:00,What if I’m a lost cause,"I started going through therapy again for the nth time and I’ve been in and out of it for 3 years. The reason for stopping is because I feel like none of the methods, which mainly involved medicines, from my past doctors worked for me. They are also either psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrists. All of them immediately told me after one session that it’s major depressive disorder, which I think is a misdiagnosis. Idk, it’s too hasty for me.

This time, I decided to approach a psychologist to try talk therapy. However, she said that she would also need the help of a psychiatrist since my condition, which is not yet diagnosed, is quite complex. Here lies my negative thought - what if I’m a lost cause? What if I’m never meant to heal?

Therapies can cost a lot of money and I live in the Philippines where there is very little support for mental health. A session can cost 1000-4000 PHP and my current therapist charges me 3000 PHP per session. But since she wants me to see a separate psychiatrist, that would mean another 3000 PHP (this clinic have a resident psych and this is their rate). She wants us to have consistency, so I should see both of them once a week. With that, I would have to spend 24000 PHP a month, medicines excluded. I am also from a middle income family. I’m currently in college and I have two younger siblings, one also in college level and the other in 10th grad. Just imagine how hard our finances are with that. I was able to open this up to my sister and all she was able to ask if I’m sure I want to do this.

What do you think? Should I just stop seeking help and accept the fact that I have to deal with this for the rest of my life? Well, I plan on not living beyond 30. Yes, I also suffer from passive suicidal ideation but that’s gonna take a whole other thread to elaborate. I don’t want to become an even heavier burden than what I already feel all my life."

RosyUnicorns,2021-09-05 07:44:01+00:00,"For the ""Boyfriend keeps interrupting cutting"" person.","Whoever made a post about their boyfriend threatening to cut himself whenever you want to do so, I wrote a lengthy response for you but before I could post it you deleted your account. I hope you can see this post and get something helpful out of it! 

Here is my reply:

I did this to my girlfriend in the past as well. She had a similar opinion to yours on this topic, and I had an similar opinion to the one I assume your boyfriend takes. Your boyfriend is doing this because he cares about you and doesn't want you to be hurt, and I know you know that because you even addressed it yourself. It doesn't make his approach to stopping you ""right"" necessarily, but I took that same approach and I understand 100% why he would want to take it too. I always got really really scared, so scared I felt sick, because I cared so much about my girlfriend and didn't want her to get hurt. So I'd always immediately threaten to hurt myself, because I knew it was the one guaranteed way to stop her. He's probably thinking similarly to me on that. Also, I'm glad you don't really feel the need to do that too often! And about feeling the need to hurt something, why not get a punching bag and beat the everliving shit out of it? I bet it would help! It usually helps me to do exercise, break items, punch a punching bag, or even scream. Screaming is ofc something you have to be careful of, not to get a noise complaint but other than that it helped me decently. And having a boyfriend, by the sound of it, living with you would help a lot too. You can find a healthy vent for you and make sure he's aware of it so it won't freak him out at first, then use that vent and he'll be there to care for you afterwards. I definitely think, although it's a really difficult topic, talking about healthy responses to that urge with your boyfriend could be beneficial. I hope my suggestions can be helpful as well. (p.s. try pushups or something if the other stuff won't work). 

Also, I don't blame you, it's super hard to deal with lots of emotions sometimes. So it's normal to feel the need to self harm in rough situations. Of course that doesn't mean it's good to do so, and I definitely think you should try your best to stop entirely, and don't be afraid to lean on your boyfriend for help with that. Or even reddit if you must. 

And lastly, you're not crazy for any of that. I actually hit my head a lot too. I don't see anything crazy about it. It's just a surge of terrible emotions that leads me to do that. Almost like I suppressed all other movements but that's where the energy was released. 

I hope my suggestions for alternatives help. I can list them all again below just to make sure it's not too messy to read (sorry lol. I write bad sometimes, and it's almost 4AM lol)

-Exercise such a pushups, situps, running/jogging... Etc
-Punching bags, or punching a pillow
-Breaking items (not the best option. Probably less effective and just, destructive, but if it works go for it!)
-Screaming, be sure to do it in a way that won't get a noise complaint. Also, there's even a way to do it without making your voice sore. I forget what it's called. Maybe something like ""Viking scream therapy"".
-Rubber bands, you can flick yourself with a rubber band to maybe satiate that urge in a less impactful way. 
-Meditation (Really not sure if it would work, but if you can calm down and keep your head clear maybe you could suppress the urge. I'd personally try exercise and stuff first bc it seems way more effective but if this works it would work well I'd imagine)
-Help from your boyfriend. Hopefully he can either help support you, talk to you, cuddle you and so on when you need it. He can also come up with other ideas and talk to you about what helps you!

I hope I've been helpful. If you ever need anything my dms are open but if you don't need to dm that's perfectly fine. And I know it's weird to offer lol. But I'd rather make sure it's known and have a chance of helping when needed than not let it be known and never be contacted. I'd prefer you ask your boyfriend for help first, or post on a subreddit bc your boyfriend could help the best, and a post gains more replies. But if you need someone direct, that is a stranger I'll be here for you. 

Have a great day/night. Take care!"

Hi r/depression, I have struggled with severe suicidal thoughts since early in my teenage years. I have borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, generalized anxiety disorder, and cPTSD. I was heavily neglected as a child and shamed for my disabilities. I began withdrawing from others and taking all my anger, sadness and disgust about the world out on myself. Some of you may know how that feels but some may not. 

Two months ago on the 10th of this month will mark two months since my most severe suicide attempt. I will spare you the details but let’s just say I spent awhile in the intensive care unit. The reason I did it was because of the severe abuse I was experiencing at home. I felt there was no way out. 

When my father was physically and verbally abusing me, it hurt. It hurt that someone who is supposed to love me was doing this. I became so consumed by this hurt that my self worth was and is still badly damaged. 

But, I must say, after all that, I have started to get back my will to fight on. And it feels so good. Often times, at least for myself, I just want the pain to go away in the moment. It’s not just any ordinary pain, it rips apart your soul into a million pieces. I know it may feel extremely heavy having these thoughts, but just know you aren’t alone. 

I hope this helps someone today in some small way 💜"

thisisntwhereibelong,2021-09-04 16:47:11+00:00,I don't actually want to die but I feel like I must,"Banned from r/SuicideWatch so I guess this is the new place to vent. Throwaway because I don't want this post to be seen on my main. Hope I don't need karma to post this.

I am planning on doing it soon. I will leave in secret, nobody has to know until then. I started selling my stuff, deleting files from my computer, I am getting rid of my existence slowly enough so no one notices a thing. And in the time between my final decision on dying till now, I realised, that I don't actually want to die. I have wonderful parents who give me a home and food and love. I have like only three friends but I know they would be hurt by my death. I wish I could be a normal functioning member of society that doesn't feel the urge to kill themselves. But I am not and sadly I know continuing to live means I will just suffer more and more and more and more until I really can't hold onto anymore. So what is the point in trying to live on if I already know that I am just waiting for it to become even worse than it already is? I was meant to die by my own hands. No that's not right, I was never meant to even being born. My parents should've aborted me. Or even better they should've used protection. It would've spared me and them a lot of unnecessary pain. But they wanted me, they loved me from the moment they saw me on the ultrasound. Sometimes I wish they didn't. Because loving me means they will suffer when I die before them. And I am really sorry. Again I wish I was normal. I wish I deserved to live, but I am not worth anything. I am a horrible human being, rotten from inside out and the world doesn't need such a useless piece of shit like me. Nonetheless I am sorry to my parents and to my friends. I wish I could've been someone that was deserving of their love."
MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-04 16:39:53+00:00,I don’t understand how to be anything but nihilistic,"I genuinely don’t understand how people do it, I really don’t. How can anyone not see how pointless all this is? I mean, maybe I can understand how people who actually manage to believe in a religion or some higher power or something can think their life matters in some “grand scheme”, but if you’re like me and don’t have a spiritual bone in your body, how could you not see that you don’t matter?

Got asked in therapy the other day why I’m constantly suicidal and I said it’s because, well, what am I actually *doing* here? I mean if you really boil it down, life is just a series of jumping from meaningless distraction to meaningless distraction over and over again, constantly chasing some kinda fucking happiness dragon, just to pass the time, to tick down the fucking clock until, maybe, one day, if you’re lucky, you die in your sleep. And then you’re just dead and that’s it. Nothing you ever did matters to you anymore. Depending on how you lived your life, *maybe* the stuff you did matters to a couple more people for a little longer until they either forgot or die and then it’s just all gone, like it never existed at all for the mass majority of people. And if you do leave behind some kinda long-lasting legacy like Einstein or Martin Luther King or someone, what the fuck do you care now? You don’t even know it. You’re dead.

And I get that some people enjoy the journey or whatever but I don’t. I simply don’t fucking care about anything. Out of everything I’ve experienced in life so far, I can honestly say I wouldn’t give a shit if I never experienced any of it again, which isn’t even to say it’s all been horrible, I’ve just never had an actually impactful positive experience. It’s all just been fleeting at best. And I’ve had plenty of impactful negative experiences and I dunno, it just kinda seems like the equation just doesn’t balance. Life sucks more than it’s good and I really don’t see any incentive at all to wanna prolong it any longer. 

And then you factor in that we love in a society that purposefully spaces out the good things, especially if you’re fucking broke all the time cause your mental issues prevent you from holding down jobs for more than about 3 months like me. So much of the shit you’re trying to work towards is just locked behind a fucking paywall that feels basically insurmountable to me at this point. Case and point, thought it might be an ok distraction to try and replace my furniture with shit I built myself, but then I looked at how much even the most basic tools I’d need to do it cost, plus the cost of materials and realised that it’s basically gonna take me a fucking year just to put aside the money required to do even some basic fucking distraction like that. It just feels like when shitty game developers pad out the length of a game by cramming hours and hours of tedious grinding in between every main quest. It just feels fucking cheap and it doesn’t need to be like this, yet there’s nothing you can fucking do about it either.

I dunno, every time I think about life, I feel like I come to the same conclusion. That I’m just waiting out the fucking clock by doing meaningless things that don’t even fulfil me in any way and if I really think about it, I’d kinda just like to skip straight to the end cause I’m just over it."
Scarlet-Tempest,2021-09-04 11:35:40+00:00,I feel so alone. [TW self harm &amp; suicide],"Since I was a kid I could never keep friends. Sometime bad always happens, whether it be me or them problems arise and I’m always the one who cares the most. I don’t like change but my past friends have never cared about the group as a whole, just their feelings. I always want to resolve the disagreement but they want to be upset and hold grudges. I’ve also never had a romantic relationship, not even a kiss. It starts to feel like it’s personal after so many years. The only common factor is me so obviously I’m the problem. It feels like I’m not good enough for people to care about me. The only person I trust is busy, she’s smart and extroverted, lives hours away. I care about her so I don’t want to take up all her time, she has other friends and I know that. I just want to feel important. I’m not blaming anyone, I know people have lives of their own. But I’ve NEVER been the priority, never been chosen first for anything. I want to feel special, loved, important. It’s hard to fight my suicidal and self harm thoughts when they convince me the people I care about don’t care about me."

people are desperate and they flee the country by sea on small boats to reach Europe.

there is nothing interesting or new to do.

im a boring ""NICE GUY"" with not a lot of hobbies, i have a boring personality. to not be a ""NICE GUY"" I would be an asshole. its clear no one likes me and the problem is me. I have to make my self happy. no one is my slave and I have to fix my self on my own.

I have trouble with comparing my self to YouTubers and Successful twitch streamers. I even tried to start a YouTube channel. or start a twitch channel but all I have is a phone. but Im greatful for what I have sometimes.. I know money isn't happiness but is part of it. 

everyones goal is happiness. everyone wants to be happy, everyone wants to matter, most everyone wants to change the world. me included. 

its always me chasing others but im tired of this, since i get nothing out of it and no one cares for me or likes me or loves me. I want to love my self. and I have improved a lot.

I'm 20, I'm at last year of school, I'm trying to learn a new language and learning mechanic skills with my dad. I'm trying to get back into soccer, I like psychology and philosophy but haven't read anything about it.

people suggested self help books and meditation and exercise. how will those make me better? I don't know what to give a fuck about. things that make me happy?

I want to improve and be smarter and gain more knowledge.. all i can do is learn from internet. by reading books or learning a skill.

I want to try out new stuff but I haven't got the money to. most of the stuff that I'm able to do is free. infinite knowledge around internet but idk whats useful or not

but I don't know what is worth reading or a skill worth learning. or idk how to be smart

bc of nothing new or interesting to do. I would fap everyday. all i could think of were girls online. bc datings not allowed in my town.

porn crushes my soul. 20 days of no fapping was hard. I guess all i can do is read books.
and hope I will be smarter and not watch porn again. after porn I lose most interest in women. I can't make them my ""goal""

I still have no friends, I don't know what to talk about with others..but in a group I can talk.

i feel like crying but I don't.. I see the stars at night and think of how precious and amazing they are and people here are fighting over likes and rts. 

not that I'm better..I used to do that too.

I know I gotta work to self improve"

Like a shell, only filled to the brim with self loathing.","         I don't feel anything anymore, just sadness, self pity, and self hatred for myself. Sometimes I just come home and cry until there's no tears left to cry. I can't force the smile anymore. I just can't fucking live with the fact that I'll be alone forever anymore.

        I'm a junior in high school, 15 turning 16 in a week or so. Over the past couple of months, I think I've truly discovered just how much of a bag of shit I am. I make mistakes on the simplest shit possible at work and have no motivation to do anything at school anymore. At work, I can't do anything without a RedBull in my system, and at school I have to take a godforsaken pill every morning that for my stupid fucking ADHD ass mind just so I can focus and have a chance at passing my classes instead of failing them like last year, and it doesn't help that the pill makes me more depressed and antisocial than I already am. My friends of 13 years - those that I've always considered my brothers - are starting more and more to avoid me and not include me in shit, cause I apparently make them look bad in front of everyone at school. They walk past me in the halls, pretending I simply don't exist. Don't even bat an eye. Every relationship I've been in, I've tried to be the best partner I can and show as much love as I can to them, as I rarely receive any at all. And what happens? They dump me like a bag of garbage at a landfill. My first girlfriend (lasted a year and a half, loved the shit outta her) dumped while I was crying my eyes out when I found out she cheated. The one after (8 months) basically just forgot we dated sometimes during the relationship since she'd just ghost me for so long. The next cheated on me, and told me every detail about it, which really fucked me up. The one after, I truly thought that she was THE one, she checked every box, had amazing personality, she was beautiful, and just loved to chill and cuddle. Then while we were talking, the topic eventually got to porn, I told her I watch it, (I think im addicted, I fucking hate it) then she was pissed with me the rest of the date, wouldn't tell me what was wrong. Once I got home, I got a message that she was suddenly not ready to be in a relationship, but she still liked me and she'd come back when she was ready. I've been on delivered from her for 2 months, and she came out as bi after. I truly believe I'm gonna be alone for my whole life. My only goal in life that I wish to achieve is just to raise a good family. To be a good father and husband to my future wife and children. To show them unconditional love and be truly happy. But that'll never happen if I can't find a woman who'll actually give a shit and love me back. What's the point of living if you'll never be able to achieve any of your goals in life, not even ONE? What reason do I have in existing if I'll never amount to anything and never truly find happiness? I just can't do this shit anymore. I don't wanna exist on this lonely unforgiving world anymore."

My parents got emailed and I got yelled at like why wouldn't I? But my parents also said they wanted to make sure my mental health was ok because after that that's all they have cared about and when I was sobbing they didnt really do much.. also I'm 14 M so sorry if this confuses you but the next subject is sleep schedule in the summer time.. so this year currently and last year in the summer time my parents still kept a strict sleep schedule but like its summer time so should that be more my choice?

FaithlessnessOk8106,2021-09-04 02:30:07+00:00,What do you do when you've tried everything?,"I'm at a point in my life where I feel like nothing I've done has been meaningful at all. My issue is that I'm an antisocial 20 year old who's never had a girlfriend and the fear of being alone is growing on me every single day. Throughout my life there have been certain phases where I'd either worked on myself a ton, went to way too many parties, and ones where I just isolate myself because I'm scared of life. Through all the struggle, women still disregard my existence while they obsess over my friends. I view myself as the one who's always left out, but no one says it to my face. I've been told I look good somedays and also been told the opposite. I've had years where I've worked hard with socializing and ones where I haven't. Oh, and also I've seen many therapists about my depression and stuff of that matter.

At the end of the day, I'm still alone and no matter how much I've opened myself up I'll never be loved. I'm just not good enough. I feel like its important if I realize that now so I'm not disappointed in the future. My parents love me and are still around which keeps me going often. My plan is too wait till they pass when I'm older and finally fulfill my destiny of ending it all, because its clear that I'm just not good enough while everyone around me is. 

I'm wondering what I should do now while I'm still around?"

darth_ewok_vader,2021-09-03 21:46:27+00:00,I dont know what to do,"Im either really lost and even more depressed without him here or I get constant anxiety

At this point Im ready to end everything because I can not handle what's going on. I got sick last night from all of this, my heart was racing for hours, I was so dizzy that even when I was lying down I felt really heavy and dizzy. I started overheating and sweating. My head started aching. This stress and anxiety is terrible. Im already depressed and semi-sucidal and this is not helping. 

Right now, I only see two paths and either way Im miserable and left not wanting to live. One with him around and I get the anxiety and get sick or one with him not and me being absolutely lost. I dont want a future without him at all. If he's not in it, then it's not worth it. 

The only other option he wont do and I know for a fact Im not important enough for him to even consider it. Im just the piece of shit no one cares about. I was never important enough to him or anyone else. No matter how much effort I put in, it wasnt enough. All the times I tried to comfort him and support him just count for nothing. He wont even try to do the same for me

He may be my best friend, and he may say Im his, but not once has he ever shown me the care or comfort of a best friend. I dont understand why I love him and care about him so much when he wont even do simple things for me. I love and care for someone who supposedly loves and cares for me back, but it really just seems like he hates me most of the time and that Im a nuisance

I know Im not the easiest friend or girlfriend, but I always tried my absolute hardest to make him happy. Tried my hardest to comfort him, to support him, whenever, no matter what, even if Im upset and feeling like absolute shit myself. I always tried my best. I loved him so much and would have spent my life with him, but it just feels like Im the dirt underneath his shoes most of the time

This breaks me further everytime we spoke because I honestly love him more than anything else and I just know that I barely mean a thing to him. I wanted to mean a lot to him and be important to him. But in reality, Im just a waste of time for him, just a waste of energy and useless. I know Im worthless to him. At this point I dont even think I should be alive anymore, Im just a waste of resources. I really thought I could mean something to him, that I did mean something to him

I hate myself, I hate my body, I hate my mind. I hate everything about me. I can see why I was worthless to him. I can see why he wouldnt ever do it. I can see why I'll always be that piece of dirt. Worthless and useless. I can't even function like a normal person anymore.

 It doesnt make sense for me to keep living at this point. I just want to end everything and rest in peace. Thats all I want. Nothing matters anymore. Nothing is worth this pain"

How many can I count before I decide that its enough. 

i used to always tell myself that I would never ever even be able to consider or attempt killing myself. But the closer I get to finishing school, and struggling to gain a degree for a career I cannot see myself finding happiness in, the more I find myself thinking about that other option. Thinking that it might be the better option. 

I have friends in school doing the same thing as me and it just seems that every semester I am handed the bad cards; the awful teachers, and they get the easy hand. They get instructors who don't want them to do all the assignments or instructors that actually teach them. Meanwhile, I get shit on. and then I fucking resent my friends? and I hate myself more for it because they're my friends and I should be happy for them.  

I am forced to expend more energy than they have to. I am fighting an uphill battle for something I don't even want. 

It's fucking hard, and I don't want it anymore. And it's too late to do something else. But I can do other things with my career, it's just gonna take one to two years of absolute fucking misery first to get there. Two years I just don't think I will be able to handle on top of the past two I've already gone through. I just feel like no one understands. 

I can't tell anyone how I feel because I think I have used them too much as my emotional dump bucket already and if I continue to do so I know that they will leave me, from past experiences. And that hurts more.

I know i should probably be put on meds but its gotten to the point where everytime i try to bring up my issues to a doctor I feel like they shut me down and think im drug seeking.

I couldn't even make any friends cause of that. They are nice to me. They want to talk and make friendship with me. But I feel like I am lesser than them.Those people are way higher than me and my pathetic life.I get anxiety when I am around them

All this may be because I never experienced a luxurious life. I don't even know how to drive.(cause I can't buy that shit). Never even went to a fancy hotel.

I act like a stupid homeless guy infront of them.I don't know why they even allowed a person like to study there.I should be in the streets of SKIDROW. Cause that's where I belong.

I am pathetic piece of shit that is good for nothing.I just want people to know I am lesser than them. They shouldn't even give me the slightest respect. They should bully me and make fun of me(I am glad they do that sometimes). I am weird and awkward and I dont know how to talk.

Sometime people in my college think I am a janitor cause I look like one."
MyBrainsInPain,2021-09-03 15:18:03+00:00,Think I’m just untreatable. Don’t know why I can’t just fucking die already…,"Guess I lost the genetic dice roll. Cause I’m completely fucked and nothing helps. CBT, DBT, EMDR, all the therapies, they’re all just fucking words. Just useless words. Words can’t help. Meds can’t help either. Been on dozens and dozens of the fucking things. They do nothing, nothing at all. Not even one measly fucking side effect. Doesn’t matter if it’s antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, they’re all the fucking same, they do nothing.

Therapists just end up throwing their hands up after long enough. They can’t help me, don’t know how I guess. Think my GP is getting to the same point after years of throwing meds at me and having them do nothing. Wonder if she even believes me.

It’s not like I don’t try. I still manage to exercise every day, still manage to cook for myself even though I never want to eat, still manage to at least try to do hobbies, even if they just frustrate me too much now cause I can’t focus. I’ve really tried all the suggestions too. Meditation, mindfulness, breathing exercises, journaling and all that shit, I mean fuck, I *wanted* it work. But none of it fucking does. Not one bit. 

Kicked my addictions too, for all the fucking good it did. Haven’t done drugs for 6 months, haven’t self-harmed for 4 months, haven’t had alcohol for 3 months. Doesn’t make any difference though. Only became an addict cause none of treatments were working. Just said fuck it and started set-medicating instead. Did it help? Not really, but it did make me numb. Liked being numb. Passed the time at least, made me feel like I didn’t have to rush towards dying, might just be able to wait for it to happen on it own. But now I’ve stopped cause two people I’ll tentatively say were friends convinced me to. But then they fucked off outta my life and I relapsed. Didn’t last long cause now it pumps me full of so much guilt I don’t even have the option of getting numb anymore. So I’ve stopped for good, I guess. And people pat you on the fucking back over it, acting like it matters at all. Acting like you’re out the other side of hell, even though you’re stuck in the worst hell you’ve ever been in cause now you have zero solutions just like before, but less options. Tell you “you should be proud” like you can even feel proud. Like them saying they’re proud or that you should be means anything to me, like it fucking translates at all.

Used to at least want things. Now I don’t even fucking care. Used to want to have someone to end the crippling fucking loneliness. Knew I couldn’t get it because I can’t connect with people, don’t even know why, just can’t. Knew people always just made me feel *more* alone. But I still wanted *someone*, even if it was a pipe dream. But now I don’t fucking care. Sounds like effort, energy I just don’t have. Couldn’t have friends or a girlfriend anyway. Too unstable. Who wants to be around someone who can go from being fine the last time you spoke to them to being completely fucked and suicidal the next? And even when I’m “fine” now, it just an act, a fucking facade that eventually I won’t have the energy to keep up. Been years since I was anything but horrifically, suicidally depressed. Probably good I can’t connect to people.

Anyway don’t even know why I’m bothering to type this. No therapist or medication can help, no one here’s gonna be able to. Guess it’s just to vent. To just announce I’ve given up. Tried to get my meds today, got told they’re “not covered” by my pension card. Would’ve cost me $40 for 28 days worth. Can’t afford it. Just fucking broke. One of the side effects of my diseased brain, can’t hold down a fucking job. Working for more than about 6 months either makes me so depressed I start self-harming, drinking or having suicide attempts, makes me catatonically dissociative so I barely know where I am and can’t hear people talking to me or it just puts me into a full-blown psychosis. Either way, the result is the same, either get fired or have to quit. So my bank accounts are empty from all the failed treatments and worthless medications. So I’m just stopping, don’t really have a choice. Just not renewing my scripts. Coming off the meds, don’t give a shit if I’m on the highest dose for both. Don’t have a choice. I just fucking give up."

I was at a very low place mentally, but as our relationship blossomed I became on top of the world. We go married 13 months later and it went downhill from there. We moved in together, and we started to fight constantly. He has anger problems and became verbally abusive. During that time, my depression came back full force. The whole relationship though, and many years before I’ve had severe anxiety. With how he treated me, my self esteem took a huge hit. Ive always had self confidence and seeing myself like this has been heartbreaking. Eventually after 7 months of marriage I stopped communication and asked for a divorce. I couldn’t get out of bed except to walk to my desk for my remote job. Then I would lay in bed all day long crying and watching tv. I wasn’t talking to anyone except my parents occasionally through text. I wasn’t leaving my apartment for days. Finally after two months, when we were about to sign divorce papers, I was so lonely, and I figured that I probably wouldn’t find anyone to be with anyway with my mental illness the way it is, i asked if he wanted to try again. its been a awful. We live three hours away, and i know that we will never be able to live with eachother. he doesn't seem like he cares half the time. sometimes i wonder if hes stringing me along. I know that if i had self esteem, and wasnt afraid of being alone, i would be done. im seeing a therapist but what can 40 minutes a week do? this relationship is torture. I feel like im going to have a mental breakdown or eventually lose my job. any advice is appreciated."

Like there’s a fog or wall between myself and the actual feeling.

I’ve been losing track of time. It constantly goes back and forth. Days can feel like they never end, and others pass like forgotten dreams. I have no appetite either, but I don’t feel sick or tired. I feel like a husk.

And the funny thing is, I finally found myself willing to live. I found purpose, but it’s something I have to wait until I can go and do it. I finally want to live, but is this what it feels like?

I can’t explain this feeling well enough. It isn’t numbness, I know the feelings are there, but they’re blocked out. Like the feelings are dulled or smudged. Like I’m listening to the radio but I can’t make out the words from the muffled speech"

Fanalia123,2021-09-02 21:55:23+00:00,Self-concept,"Listen up fellow confused, lonely, depressed peeps of the world. I learned something yesterday in my speech class that I think everybody on here should learn about. It's called self-concept. I just typed out a bunch of this in reply to someone's post. They asked how do I start to love myself? No one ever explains how to do that. I'm not saying this is ""the"" answer to that age old question but I certainly think it steers us in the right direction. This is a looong post but I think if you're interested you should read it through anyway. I tried to explain everything thoroughly and give examples to make the ideas more understandable.

 Self-concept is how you think and feel about yourself. The way you view yourself, whatever your self-concept is, sets limits on your behavioral possibilities.

 For example: your friend invites you and some other people out for lunch. You want to go. You want to make friends with these other people and have a great time. Instead of saying yes you tell your friend no and possibly throw out an excuse or a lie as to why you can't come. Why'd you do that to yourself? Because you have bad/low self-concept.

How does your self-concept form? Through reflected appraisals, social comparisons, and your self-perception. Reflected appraisals are the messages you get about yourself from others. It could be the actual words they use when speaking to you, their body language around you, their tone, or a whole host of things. The way they react sticks with you and prompts you to respond different ways.

Let's go back to the example. You really want to say yes and go to lunch with your friend and the other people who were invited. A year ago you were similarly invited out by a different friend and said yes. The other people who came to lunch ignored you for the most part or were pleasantly dismissive toward you: ie answering your question politely but quickly moving on to talk to the others at the table. You felt unwanted there and an outcast. Because of that every time you get invited out, like now for lunch, you say no because you don't want to feel like a burden or bother anyone while they're having fun.

Social comparisons are when you compare yourself to others to see how you match up. Artists like myself have a problem with this because we are always comparing our skills to other artists. If we aren't confident in our art, which I've never met one who was totally confident in their skill, then we compare our art to others who we think are better or at the level we wish we were on. It makes us miss the progress we've made and makes us dissatisfied and depressed.

Self-perception is the way you see yourself. Do you find yourself attractive? Do you consider yourself smart or stupid? Are you confident in your writing skills but not your speaking skills? If so then why?

Alright so now that I've broken all that down we get to the bit that works to answer your question. How do you learn to love yourself? Work on changing your self-concept. Ask yourself these seven questions, write down your answers, contemplate over them, and then figure out what you need to do.

1) where should change begin?
2) what do you want to change?
3) are your circumstances (home life, family, religion, etc) keeping you from changing?
4) are you willing to take chances?
5) what is a realistic goal you can set for yourself?
6) can you discipline yourself (work on changing your habits, work on self control, etc)
7) are there people to support you?

I'll elaborate on a what a few of these mean with examples so that they are more easily understood. My teacher broke down the lecture like this yesterday and it made everything easier to remember.

4) Are you willing to take chances? This doesn't necessarily mean that you take chances on big things like moving to another state or another country. Are you willing to take chances for smaller things?

You want friends but you're afraid to ask around and put yourself out there. You're lonely and depressed. You want friends and want to be social and go out and do things. You're afraid to ask if people want to be friends with you though. And that could be for a multitude of reasons. If you admitted this to someone and they said ""I'll help you make some friends. Do you want my help?"" what would your response be? Would you shy away, say no, and choose to remain psychologically safe? Or would you take decide to take a chance, a possible psychological risk, and say yes?

What is a psychological risk and what does it mean to be psychologically safe? ""Psychological"" has to do with the mind, the mental and emotional state of a person. Psychologically safe means remaining in your comfort zone whatever that may entail. People invite you to lunch, you always say no because then there's no chance of being judged/rejected by friends/strangers. It's lonely but it's safer. A psychological risk is when you decide to take a chance on doing something that may potentially hurt your mental health. You say yes to the lunch invite. There is now a chance that things can go south and people could ignore you/reject you/be rude to you/etc. Or things could go great and you've just made yourself some new friends who want to go out and do things with you.

6) can you discipline yourself? I broke that down a little in the parentheses. Here's an example. This is actually the same one my teacher made.

You have paper due on Monday morning. It is 5:00 on Friday. You have decided to spend the evening working on your paper, because you didn't start during the three weeks you had beforehand, and will perfect it over the weekend. You get a call right as you are setting up to work from a friend. He and the rest of your friends are at a bar and they want to come have wings and drink with them. You immediately agree. You go and have a great time and get drunk and go home. 

Now it's Saturday and you're hung over. You take the morning to recover and promise yourself that you'll work on the paper that afternoon. Well it turns out your university has a football game tonight, everybody is getting together for a tailgate party, and you just have to be there for that. Anybody who's anybody is gonna be at the tailgate and then the game. You go out, party, watch the game and have a great time.

Now it's Sunday. You're hung over again! You still haven't done any work on your paper. You haven't gotten past your name on the page. Your favorite team is gonna be on tv at 1:00 though and you don't wanna miss that. You watch the game. You love it. You invite friends over. Everybody is having a great time.

It is now Sunday night and you have done absolutely nothing on your paper and you're doomed. How do you avoid this disaster next time? Slowly learn to self-discipline. Next time you've waited till Friday to do your paper and your friends invite you out tell them you'll be there at 7:00. You aren't completely denying yourself the fun thing you want to do and you aren't overloading yourself and over stressing yourself either. Saturday rolls around and you still have paper left to write but the tailgate is starting. Tell your friends you'll be there for the game. Can't make the tailgate. Little changes go a long way.

I hope something out of this helps. I had never heard of any of this except self-perception until yesterday. I guess I had heard of self-discipline too but never explained in that way. It's fascinating to me and it definitely makes the path to self improvement easier for me to see. Good luck to all of you and I hope I explained this stuff well enough to understand."

My mind is dissolving due to a traumatic brain injury due to poison, every moment is like living in a very thick fog, I am not who I used to be and its becoming more difficult to express myself, its very difficult to do anything and I have very low initiative. 

I am very afraid of the future, I do not want to become a vegetable and if that is the case then I will not allow myself to degenerate into that stage, I need to go out on my own terms and die with some dignity. Thinking about ending it before my fears come true helps me live as normally as possible, knowing that I won't let it get to that.

It's frustrating that other people can't see it when they look at me, but to me the nightmare is very obvious and am aware of how I am now is drastically different to how I was prior to the poison, I know the difference between the cognitive decline and depression. They are both different. There is a big part of me that I can no loner access but it's still there, somewhere, which is why I can still write perhaps but since I can no longer access it at will I am scared that it's going to crumble away then after that I could lose more.

Wolfpanther767,2021-09-02 13:21:24+00:00,Need help; Urgent,"Guys.... My situation is really bad .I need your help

&amp;#x200B;

My ex and I broke up 3 years ago. It was the greatest time of my life which I wish I could have again. I really loved her and the moments I spent with her . My mom knew about our affair and she supported it(Relationship out of marriage is uncommon in our culture). After about 3 months her family had a financial crisis. She didn't tell me anything about this. I came to know about her situation only when my friend told me. She asked me to get over her because her mother came to know about our relationship and her financial situation wasn't the best factor for our happiness either.

&amp;#x200B;

After this whole incident blew over, we weren't really sure what was the situation between us(although she asked me to get over her she stuck around). So ultimately I asked her if she was really up for this relationship to continue. Well, that didn't go over really cause apparently she had another affair, well that was my breaking point I went into a slump of depression. I couldn't handle the situation. The feelings were too overwhelming and they turned into fits of rage. But, even then I loved her. This whole incident turned me into an introvert and I could barely converse with my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Well out of spite I asked out another girl who was in my class, and a month later she said ok. Me getting settled didn't really make my ex that happy and she continued to show her possessiveness. 

&amp;#x200B;

why should she show her possessiveness ? Few moths later i met my ex and spoke to her. I asked her if she had feelings for me. She didn't reply. Months passed, and I graduated high school still going on with my relationship, I had the ambition of working in the Merchant Navy and my family also supported me fully . My lover didn't allow this as she had the fear of sea accidents and asked me not to apply for the entrance exam to Merchant Navy. She knew that I was frustrated with not applying. And just for context my current girlfriend is a very caring and humble person overall. But, ever since the whole merchant navy thing the relationship has been strained although continuing.

there is a lot of mistake form my side too at the beginning time i cared a lot then it gradually decreased

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

friends, colleagues, comrades (XD)... I still have feelings for my ex. She contacted me last week asking what was the real reason behind our breakup and asking me to forget about the past and stuff cause she still has an affair. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm frustrated, have insomnia, depressed and don't have a sense of what to do. I feel that if I breakup with my current girlfriend I'll be happy but the feeling of guilt isn't allowing me to.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : Ex and I broke up, out of spite and anger and depression fell into another relationship, she didn't allow me to pursue my goal due to plausible reasons and now ended up in a toxic relationship where I want to breakup and my guilty conscience isn't allowing me to because she was dumped and had a really bad experience earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I’ve been having a really hard time getting by. I’ve felt like giving up, that my life may be over. I’ve felt hopeless, and defeated.. not knowing how Ill get out of this. I don’t know if it’s the the overwhelming loneliness that I feel or the fact that I still find myself in the same toxic living situation in September of 2021. It’s 3:46 am as I write this and I’ve all been thinking about my dreams and goals and how I’m letting my potential go to waste when I still have the time. I’m realising how much I’ve lived my life in fear. The fear of what IF. The fear of the worst outcome. The fear of losing. There’s no doubt this fear protects me in a way, it’s a part of me But.,"

Everyone treats me like I don’t exist. I’m dealing with health problems so I have to depend on them taking care of me which has probably lead to me feeling like a burden to them. But it’s literally like no one really cares about me, they’re just there by obligation.

They won’t even hold a basic conversation with me and when I talk it’s like they’re just waiting for me to finish talking to them. All I get back is “uh” “uhuh” “yeah/no”. And their door is always shut. And when I’ve been very sick they’re annoyed to help me. I mean I’ve been extremely sick and only ask for help when I ABSOLUTELY have to.

I feel invisible and unloved/unwanted and not cared about.

I feel very very alone and I never thought being alone was a bad thing until I had to depend on people who MAKE ME feel alone.

Because of my health I can’t just leave my situation, I’m stuck here. Not sure what to do so any advice would be nice on how to cope with my depression and loneliness. I’ve tried distracting myself but it’s been a very painful daily realization."

But now that I'm home I dream every night of how much I want to go back where I belong, where I had a purpose. Sometimes I just wish that I had died with my friends.

I’m 22 and just graduated college, so lots of stress with money and finding a job I like and debt. The anxiety from that doesn’t help, but what’s mainly getting me lately is how incredibly lonely I feel. I thought I had some really solid friends, but lately they’ve been very busy with their own life and significant others that they’ve been ignoring me. I feel like no one really wants to know me, or actively spend time with me. I don’t have anyone that asks me how my day has been. 

Of course my family loves me (and I love them too), but they’re sort of obligated to and they live a bit aways. I’ve felt so down these past few days that I really wish it would end. Of course I’ve read all the stuff online I should do to make myself feel better but it just feels far away at this point. I don’t even really know what my objective with this post is, but maybe just so at least someone will know how I’m feeling.

Thanks for reading."

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 19. I'm now 27 and haven't seen anyone regarding it since I was diagnosed. I never had any type of medicine for it, so I don't even know if that would help me. 

My boyfriend thanks Im just really really sad and its so much more than just that. I feel bad for him, because he deserves better. I have weeks where I dont get anything done. I let our house become a mess and he gets upset about that. I've really tried talkin to him about how I feel but he really thanks it's just me being dramatic and I should just snap out of it. 

I'm not going to kill myself. My cousin did 2 years ago and I seen how that was on our family. I can't put my grandma through that. I would love to stop thanking that I should every single day though. 

I have a 9 year old daughter who I have full custody of. I'm constantly feeling like I let her down and that I'm not that great of a mom. Mainly because some days its hard to get out of bed and we eat frozen pizza all the time. 

I really don't know what to do to shake myself out of this funk I am in. I feel as if I'm going deeper and deeper into my depression every single day now. The past few months have been the worse on me. 

I don't even know why Im writing this. I guess to let anyone else know that if your feeling really bad, you haven't washed your dishes in a week, you dont have any clean underwear, and you've made frozen pizza the past 2 nights...that your not really alone. Because I'm right there with you. 

I'm looking into getting real help. I've found a few places near me. I prolly want do anything anytime soon tbh. I tend to not thank I'm not worth the trouble and that my boyfriend and daughter need to be cared for above me.  

I really dont know what to do. This post has been all over the place, but thats how my mind has been. Thanks if you took the time to read this mess."

I’ve been thinking to take antidepressants for a while now. I have sudden outbursts (or breakdown episodes (?)) wherein I just cry and cry. I can feel the physical pain in my chest, or heart, specifically. It’s so heavy. I’ve been seeing a psychotherapist for a few months already, but it doesn’t seem to help. It started because of work which I already resigned from 2 months ago. And then this pandora’s box (collection of traumatic events in my subconscious) seem to have been opened so I’ve been still experiencing the breakdowns despite seeing a psychologist.

For people who took antidepressants: Was it worth it? How was your experience with it? Did it help? 

Im sorry I just needed answers. I have no friends who took antidepressants before. Im also shy to reach to them, especially now that I need them the most. 

Thank you, strangers."

rubberman83,2021-09-01 12:17:48+00:00,I hate living and am only waiting for it to end,"I hate this life so much. 

I never asked to be born. I spent all my life so far on autopilot, completely removed from what was happening. Just went with the flow, did what I was told or “supposed to”. Tried to be myself a couple times but it blew up in my face so I put on a mask hiding my true self 99% of the time. Nobody knows the real me, even my wife, my mom or my son. I present myself as a nice and happy man, but deep inside I’m an extremely selfish coward and borderline evil with no sympathy who is always angry, frustrated and sad. I have been this way for at least 35 years straight. I don’t think I have enough energy left to keep that mask on so I don’t know what will happen when I take it off and I’m a bit scared to tell the truth.

All my life I thought that if this or that happened I would finally be truly happy, or satisfied, or anything positive, but I always end up more and more frustrated. Found a girl that loves me and married her, had a child because that’s what you’re supposed to, right? Now I deeply regret it all and I feel trapped in a life that is really not for me. I hate being this responsible adult, all I want is to be left alone and sleep the rest of my life away. I have a good career that no longer motivates me, but I can’t do anything else. Everybody expects so much of me but I have nothing to offer anymore, I just don’t care. 

The only thing that keeps me alive is the fear of failing my suicide I’m a coward. 

Now my best option is to try and catch something lethal like cancer or something. I have resolved to never see a doctor again (they never take me seriously anyway and getting an appointment is incredibly hard where I live). I’m pretty sure I have something bad right now but I’ll just let it develop and kill me. This way the people who will miss me won’t be able to blame me for killing myself, they will think it was natural.

I don’t want to live for others, nor for me. I just want it to stop. Life is too goddamn long and difficult. It’s meaningless and not worth the trouble. I’m sorry I brought someone else into this world against their consent, that is my deepest regret and I will never forgive myself. 

If you have read this I’m sorry I wasted your time. I'm not looking for help or anything, just to vent."

I don't think I want to ever open up to someone again because it feels like once I get close to showing myself for who I am and who I want to be it's always the wrong choice, I need to be an emotionally stunted stone so that I can't throw away the chances that I'm given.

I feel so psychotic and pathetic having these gut wrenching feelings about such a small thing, I cried and broke in the garage so my parents couldn’t hear it. And my brother relayed the message by text to me.

This person from elementary school wanted to know how I was. This person, my best friend from then, had asked about me and actually wondered if I remembered them.

The idiot I am, I never used truly used the Facebook ever. I Made it then discarded it basically. anything outside of Reddit, I don’t use. Not Twitter or Instagram. Nothing. They make me uncomfortable.

I always Sabotage any chance of normalcy.

I haven’t had a friend for so long I don’t really remember what that is. 
And Someone remembered me. 

I’m so fucking pathetic. I don’t know. 

I made an impact enough for someone from that long ago to think about me, wonder about me. I was a child then. Not the same person. I’m so badly different grownup. So it’s like someone else did that.

When I read the message I felt alive. A second hand message, from my brother. Now I’m crying and mourning my lack of anything resembling a healthy existence.

I don’t expect anything. I’m not that insane, I just can’t believe someone took the time to ask about me. I wish I could say hello back. I don’t know. I hate what I let myself become"

Nobody cares about an old fuck like me. 

You people in their teens you think you have it bad now wait 25 years down the road then you'll think otherwise on how you'll never find love or any kind of friendship

My relationship has gone to shit where i just feel like im being used for a place to live and for my money to pay her bills and necessities.. I feel this way because as much as i try its not enough for her  im tired of being the only one saying i love you or giving random kisses all the time. I spent all my free time with her everyday just to get her attention and it just feels one sided i cant even get her to put her hand on my lap and i do that all the time. I try too fucking hard just to get her to say i love you without it being forced.

Friends.. I try to make them and its just too fucking hard when your stuck in your mind all the time and the only person you had to listen to you was ""you"" i dont know how to start conversations its because i lack the social skills that i should have already but i dont so im stuck with just asking "" what type of music do you listen to? "" or "" what movies do you like"" its cause im fucking stupid and i dont know what to say. I want to have friends but its just a process and a half for me to get any. And when i get interested in talking to a person i say too much and bam there goes that back to square one

I will always reply back to people just not real fast on reddit because i dont get notifications like that for Reddit and i also sleep in the day because of my job being third shift. This would be another reason i feel i cant get any friends cause im sleeping when people are up and im up when people are sleeping. I do have whatsapp and kik those are better to see the messages

So kids if you think you have it bad. Just know your not fully grown up yet wait till you old like me where your hair is falling out your teeth look like shit from being too depressed. Looking like shit because no one fucking cares why put in any effort your never going to impress anyone. Nobody fucking cares man!"

I won’t disclose my age but I’m in my early 20s.

Honestly I’m a lonely, unattractive, fat piece of human waste. I can’t run for more than 3 mins without sweating like a pig and gasping for air. I’ve never been in a relationship and I’ve never felt affection in any romantic sense. And I really have no friends. I used to be a popular guy at school but something traumatizing I won’t say for my own sanity took place and changed me forever. I went from extremely extroverted to very shy and introverted.

Since then it’s been really hard for me to make friends and during quarantine I gained a lot of weight. It made me even more insecure about my looks but recently in the past month I’ve lost just over 20 pounds mainly due to starvation but I still look fat. And I know even if I were to continue and become fit and skinny I’d still be unattractive because I’m just a ugly person. I’m still in the process of embracing the fact I will never find a partner because I’m a very unattractive boring person and it hurts, but what can you do.

I know that my situation isn’t the worst and there are people who have it far worse, but I hate being a lonely pathetic loser. I’m not suicidal but what value am I getting out of life if I just live in solitude like this. No one would even miss me they’d just recognize me.

birnini5,2021-08-31 13:50:09+00:00,I don't see a future after I graduate.,"To the person reading this, you don't have to comment. I'm just trying to vent.

Okay, tomorrow is the first day of second semester(community college sophomore). I have a big graduation exhibition coming up this December. 

I'm majoring graphic design and am working as a team of 5 people for this exhibition. I really love graphic design in general and I worked hard for this exhibition until now.

The thing is, I've always been passively suicidal. OCD has been eating away my brain especially this last semester. I've had it as long as I can remember. Had almost every kind of OCD at different time periods since age 5. 

I always try to over achieve in my major and the force that motivates me is death. 'I can die after I've perfected this.' I hide my depression so much that other people think I'm really invested in my goals. But I don't see a future after graduation. I don't know why I am like this. I've numbed my emotions so much(which is also part of OCD symptoms) I feel calm enough to ignore it and work away. Yet the presense of doom lingers over me. I probably won't try to die after graduation since I'm a chicken but I don't want to live either. I'm always in a numb dissociative state.
I feel like I'm motivated because I'm working with 4 other people. If I was not, I wouldn't mind natural death.

pd: he recently started going to therapy)

The texts:

“There are acts that can be very valuable but to no avail. I have known for months that it is a lost and absurd battle that is not worth fighting and things have happened accordingly and got worse. We could not do it separately, nor together, we could not do it in more favorable situations, we cannot do it now it would simply be absurd. It would be better for you to dedicate your time to yourself or anything else.”

“It is simply useless already, it was useless half a year ago and it is now more than ever. There’s no need on making a great effort if it has to be useless.”

“I consider the help (not yours but from anyone) useless given the situation, and I think time has proved me right.”

“Everything has gone from bad to worse, it would be absurd to think that things could work out.”

“In December I told you that no matter how much you wanted it was not viable, that it would become a struggle between you and depression and that we could not win in any way, and everything has happened like this, I am able to distinguish my thoughts from reality yet.”

It is very heartbreaking to see him like this. He has said these things to me many times, so it doesn’t come as a surprise to me that he thinks this way, but it is still hard. He always ends up coming back to me, and I want to be supportive of him and do whatever I have to do best so it allows him to feel at least a bit safer with me. 59 feel that he is actually not alone and that getting better is not impossible, but he keeps pushing me away. what should I really do?"

Yes being an unattractive female is shitty too but as a guy it feels worse. No one is going to approach you because guys are approaching all women all the time. So they don’t need to do it. But being rejected constantly due to height, weight, looks is pretty demoralizing. It’s like you need every other aspect of your life to be perfect as well as have confidence and great mental health/strength to keep going and push through bullshit. But it doesn’t feel worth it. It doesn’t feel worth it to go through 100 rejections to maybe get 1 yes finally. You become this bitter broken individual. It isn’t bitterness that women rejected you, it’s the bitterness of how they do it and why they do it. The fact that an attractive guy to that woman wouldn’t have needed to wow her, she would’ve been a lot easier for him. Idk I guess I’m just bitter and tired of the loneliness but ehh guess I’m meant to be in a constant state of hell. And don’t tell me I should be happy alone.

I don't think I'm capable of happiness. And that's okay. I've done so much bad and my claim to fame is hate/negativity. I'll be one less bad thing on this earth."

Turbulent_War_7720,2021-08-30 13:40:09+00:00,Today marks 6 years since my best friend died.,"My best friend was such a sweet soul. He was such a gentleman. We basically grew up together since we first met in kindergarten. In high school, we even started dating. Kids were cruel, and we got bullied a lot when we were seen together because we were the ""weird"" kids. That was hard on me.

In 2015, he was missing from school for a week. I heard he was in hospital, but not for what. I didn't think too much of it. On the morning of the 30th of August, I got the news that he passed away. Ruptured appendix. There was nothing that could be done, it was too late. 

On the day of the funeral, I was one of the last people to see him in his casket. I can still feel how cold his forehead was. I can vividly picture him dressed in his tuxedo. The image of his pale white face with dried blood in his nose haunts me to this day. I was one of the casket carriers, and let me tell you, carrying his casket out of the church was one of the heaviest things I've ever done in my life. That day broke me.

And from that day on I thought, why him? Why couldn't it have been me? To this day, I'd swap places with him in a heartbeat because he had more reason to live than I ever did.

Today I work as a shopkeeper in a small tuck shop, not even earning minimum wage. I'm going nowhere very fast. I feel like a failure. A waste of potential. All that keeps me going is my mom."

Awkward-Yard6121,2021-08-30 10:12:37+00:00,I need to vent so here's my life story lmao,"And now here I am. My future looks good, I have good grades and live in a country where going to university is very cheap. Still, I feel so lonely. I only have one friend left and our friendship is slowly crumbling down.

I get so jealous when I see my classmates being all in a big friend group with each other, going outside, making memories, being happy, caring for each other, doing all the things I want to do so badly. 

I don't even know what a healthy friendship looks like. How often do you meet? What do you do? Where do you go? Are all questions I would post under r/AskReddit if I wouldn't be so ashamed of what people might think of me.

I tried making friends but it's a slow process because I'm just way to passive. And of course all those ""white knights in shining armor"" in my class make things even harder. All those idiots acting like mother Teresa, pretending to worry even though they don't give a fuck. 

Luckily I've been going to the school counselor ig. They told me to stop self harming but I don't see a point in stopping. They said I'm destroying my body, but well, I don't care. I've been doing it for so long and now I'm at a point where it is the only thing that calms me down.

I'll probably have to go to a mental hospital because I literally don't give a fuck about anything anymore I don't even have the energy to answer people's texts on the internet (sorry). At this point feel like a sociopath, I don't feel empathy for anyone anymore not even myself."
Awkward-Yard6121,2021-08-30 10:09:21+00:00,Ruining my teenage years,"I'm 15 years old, which I know, is very young. I started having thoughts about dying when I was around 5 or 6. I don't think they could have been considered suicidal. ""If I'd die all my problems would go away."" Was what I thought. I didn't consider killing myself at the time, simply because I didn't know much about death and how it works. I just wouldn't have had a problem if I'd have died. 

I talked to my mom, telling her that I wanted to go to heaven and see how it looked. Unfortunately she didn't see that as a red flag and shook it of. 

Later, when I got into elementary school, I made a bunch of toxic friends who would stop talking to me, saying that I was being mean to them. I was under constant fear that they'd leave me because, of course, it would always happen out of the blue. That combined with an abusive father led me to develop social anxiety and abandonment issues. 

I also suspect that I might have PTSD. Why? Well, because my father let me watch these true crime TV shows about rape and murder when I was only 4 years old and now I'm incredibly scared of men. Also, whenever I hear the word ""Pedophile"" (only in my mother language tho) I get a very weird unsettling feeling and fear.

And now here I am. My future looks good, I have good grades and live in a country where going to university is very cheap. Still, I feel so lonely. I only have one friend left and our friendship is slowly crumbling down.

odyssey2021,2021-08-30 03:19:48+00:00,Broken,"I was super sick in elementary school and missed like 30 days a year and was low energy when I went to school, I didn't have any friends from school id hangout with but my neighbor who was 3 years older than me in the 5th grade when i met him. He was cool and had a girlfriend and let me hangout with him, I only remember sticking around him as he made fun of me and would hit me in the arm as a joke although i never felt bullied and all the sleepovers playing games all night.

 Then I got sicker and missed like half of middle school and was like a empty husk, although i was there I had no friends and was just in pain but I didnt feel sad. I did feel uncomfortable, I would sit at lunch with the same group of kids and sometimes never say anything due to real pain or faking it as a excuse why I'm not talking. And why would i need friends when i had a best friend at home who is in HS now and has a car and a hot girlfriend who is friendly with me.  

My first year in HS i missed entirely because I was hospitalized or sick from home. I was 14 and and thought I was going to die and accepted death and I don't know exactly when I started saying it but for the longest time i never thought i would make it to 20. When I get back to school at 15 I'm a year behind so I have to deal with immature freshman in my class and make no friend I can talk to, I start leaving to go home at lunch because I dont want to sit alone, I never felt like i had anxiety because I could always go up and talk to someone like a pretty girl for a class project or anyone but I could never make friends, when all the kids where in a group of friends having fun I never knew how to join in and express myself. My best friend started selling and smoking a lot of weed and was scamming people for money, all his friends were drug dealers or girls and he would smoke me out too. Although it was for free he did owe me like 1000 at this point from money he said he would pay back.

 Over summer he gets arrested for car theft, gta, and like 3 misdemeanors and I pay 1000 for his lawyer and he owes me 2k now. My 2nd year in HS I'm getting all As in AP classes and smoking weed like daily, he would text me if I wanted to come over and I would say yeah in 90% of our texts. By winter he gets evicted from his house and I breakdown and start staying up late to be there with him while i still can and my grades drop, by February I'm failing classes and lying about being sick but I'm just staying up smoking with him and not studying. I felt like I was living 2 different life's, one at school and one around him and that life was falling apart. I never did anything because I had no other friends and i was to sick to want to do something, I lived my life through him. I didnt care about school. I convince my mom to let him live with me and keep letting him borrow money to buy sheets of LSD because its easy money to flip and he will pay me back with extra soon. He kept having no money from smoking and drinking to much but I never said anything and he owes me like 3k now . 

My 3rd and last year in HS I fail most of my classes and never graduate because some scheduling problem of not giving me gov and econ last semester and i never went back, I was always the smart kid at top of my class but I didn't care. I smoked daily and had panic attacks weekly, I felt so empty and broken but weed helped me forget. My friend was starting to sell coke I guess the year before but he had a problem my last year at school, he would stay up till 2 doing coke and smoking weed with me then have me wake him up at 530 to go to work which I was fine with because he let me hit his juul for doing it (which I eventually stopped but nicotine made things worse in long run) there was so many lies I dont even know who i am from all of it. I remember when he tried to kill himself when he took like 40 xannax and he ended up in some psych place for 2 week and it felt like the world crumbled around me when his girlfriend rang my door bell crying. I wasnt thinking of my future, I still though I was going to die by 20 in the back of my head and never thought about my life. 

once summer comes I get a job at movie theatre and turn 19, he keeps talking about how he to hit a lick and make some money, which he also did literally. He keeps asking me to help brainstorm ideas to make money and he asked about my job because he successfully robbed his job before and i tell him about the big safe full of money but i need a code which managers use at end of day and after like 3 months of him bugging me daily about it I finally see the code and he makes a plan which i told him was stupid and it would be easier to get a ladder and use roof access with no security. A old manager was just caught for stealing and they didn't change the codes. The night he and one of his buddies who had also been arrested before went to do it but the ladder was to small and they go home. Next week my friend gets the ladder and we wait for his buddie again and my friend keeps doing coke to stay up and offers me some to stay up to which I never said no to free drugs. After waiting 3 hours doing coke I say fuck it I'll just hold the ladder for you. I was never supposed to be there but I'm stupid. We get the ladder up and he is to scared to go up but im not scarred so all the sudden I'm the one going in and I get 10k but set off a alarm and when I go to get back down he wasnt at the 20ft ladder to hold it because he got scarred waiting and went to go lookout by the car so i like jump off the roof going down the ladder ( the ladder was on a open staircase on the back for 2nd floor emergency exit so the 20ft ladder is 10ft in the air at top of staircase, if i fell I could die) my dumb ass takes off my mask to see while I go down stairs and I leave the ladder because I cant do everything myself, also the bag he gave me had a hole in it so I had left a LITERAL MONEY TRAIL. I get into car and he dries off, I throw up and feel nauseous when i get home. We split it the next day after sleep 4800 each even though 11k was stolen, idk if he pocketed more or what. He blows through his money on alcohol and coke in like a month and I give him like 2000 of mine so he owes me 5.5k ish but its fine because next month he is getting a car crash insurance payout of 30k with 20k to bills. So he will just pay it all then he says

I spend the next month stressed and just smoke my days away like noting happened, I have no other friends so I do stress smoke and go to work. Then like 3 days before my friend gets his check the cops show up  search my House because he bought the ladder with a debit card because he was 8$ short.  And he also said that on paper he lives with his aunt so nothing can connect us but i guess that was a lie. Cops question me and i break down, they had a lot of evidence on my friend and I never through away my shoes that I walked on roof with because im a idiot who smoked away rational though on top of my mask I dropped I ended up confessing without a lawyer because im stupid. I get processed and got bail and go to text my only friend because I feel like im disowned in my family now even though I know My mom loves me, but i go to text my friend and im blocked on everything. And they charged me with 2nd degree burglary (violent) because I went into a empty building without a weapon at night.

When I was crying in the interviewing room with the police I was worried about my friend going to jail for 8 years and was not worried about me at all, I thought of them with my best friend she was literally my world I don't think I had some weird psychological crush on him or if I just didnt want to be lonely with no friends but with how he abandoned me even after saying he'll get help with lawyers in case we got caught. I just feel used in even worse now I'll never get that 5.5k or see my best friend again.

Since I was arrested in Oct 2019 I have talked to no one except my drug dealer like once every month or 2 and my family. I lay down and smoke all day everyday. When im not high in crying and feel broken. I have no friends, my school life is over and my life through him is over. I don't know who I am or what i like, how do i make friends when I don't even know who i am. My life collapsed and I don't know what is left. I lay in bed high for 90% of the day on YT or netflix or reading books like I've always done when i feel bad. What's the point of applying for a jib when they will just deny you because you've been arrested. I dont have social media but who would want to be friends with something as broken as me. Ive been saying i need to fix myself before i start life again but I feel so helpless when i think about it and end up doing nothing. Also I might be gay. I always loved girls and girls clothes and would envy girls, if I wasnt 6'3"" with big feet and a big dick then I would probably be trans. Im not flamboyant like stereotypical gay guys and I was never sexually attracted to guys but I like wearing girls underwear and masturbating and I like butt stuff so I might've been suppressing something because my friend was homophobic but that just makes me even more confused and ashamed and I just dont know who I am anymore.

My Suicidal Thoughts started back in middle school but was a byproduct of panic attacks due to medication. I would always just breathe and when I would calm down those thoughts would be out of my head. In hs they were stress induced I told myself that this really sucks but killing myself is scary so if I go 5 years with constantly feeling this I'll kill myself and its been 7 years of having suicidal thoughts at least once a month to multiple times a day like the past year( sometimes i can stay high all day and will have gaps up to a week or two where in so high i forget All my problems and im just reading my books, then I think about my life and get suicidal again so i smoke to help and ive just done this for the past 2 years in a loop) and I just feel lost now. I have never been scared of anything since I accepted death at 14 except the thought of oblivion so now its been more than 5 years and i still haven't killed myself so i guess im also a coward now. 

I feel like ive never opened myself to anyone, I never had any close friends who I didn't just smoke my self numb around ( oh and im a quiet high so I get beamed and just vibe) i never had a girlfriend, although my friend bought me a prostitute and although it was in for like a min I spent 20 min trying to get hard then I guess I was to big and she started bleeding and left me hanging without cumming so I'm sorta not a virgin? Hugs make me uncomfortable or really just any physical touch even though I just want to be hugged. I feel like I'm just rambling now and dont know where I was going. 

I'm broken and stuck, ive had no will to live and now that im 21 and not dead and started looking at my life, it just seems hopeless With how I've ruined it. And if it's been this bad for this long without killing myself I don't think I ever will even though I'm still filled with thoughts doing it."

Now if I am even surrounded by the right people, my insecurities and trust issues win. I wanna love and trust but I dont think I have any of it left. Its been like 1.5 years but all I can think about at night is the people who were hurting me all of the time. I have dreamed detailed conversations with them telling them how much I was hurt by them like 100 times cuz they all are so oblivious and dont know anything. I never get tired of having these conversations in my head. But I would never be able to actually complain to them. I dont know whats wrong or whats right. I dont know how to react to things. I dont have boundaries cuz the people that were supposed to teach me about them were the ones who actually crossed them first. I try to think of many things to find one to live for but nothing seems worth it. I still cry about those people and care about them. I just lie to myself and give a fake reason to live everyday. I dont wanna live but I dont wanna die either. I just want to vanish like I never existed. Made a post like this after a long time cuz kind words stopped helping anymore."

Junior-Bobcat-2487,2021-08-30 00:22:02+00:00,Struggling,"I’ve delt with depression for alot of my life. I lost my mom to cancer a month after I turned 21 in 2010 and spent most of my 20s in a dark place never really processing it in a healthy way. Fast forward to 2017 and thats when I hit an all time low becoming suicidal and hating the fact I would wake up and see another day. That became a real turning point for me I decided I really needed to get my life in order. Over the past few years that’s exactly what I did. I quit a job i hated and got my dream job.Started chasing a hobby I have loved since I was 9 but was too scared to ever try, lost over 40pounds, got myself outta debt and started a real savings account. Everything seemed and felt like I finally got my life on track and was heading into a great direction as I turned 30. I was becoming more social and really breaking outta my shell. 




Then covid hit and everything started to fall apart. I lost my dad to cancer/dementia last December ten years almost to the day that I lost my mom. A month later I got covid and it took a horrible toll on me this past January. In march I found out my dream job would be shutting down in May. That job ment alot as I met alot of special people who helped me become a better person. Saying goodbye to them sent me down a bad spiral of weed and junk food where I ended up putting on 20pounds. My hobby has been on hold since covid started as its a contact activity (i was actually getting pretty good at it too precovid)Ive gone through a good chunk of my savings as I look for other work and am back in more debt then ive ever been in before. Ive found myself now not knowing where the past six weeks of my life have gone as ive just been getting high almost everyday. Im watching everyone around me living what seems to be their best lives wither its exciting new jobs, awesome vacations, new houses, getting married and so on while im laying in bed so broken and numb. I havent left the house in over two weeks as getting outta bed feels like it takes everything I have in me. I havent posted on social media in months and kinda fallen off the face of the earth what hurts most about that is that is seems and feels like no one has noticed or cares. 





Thankfully im not suicidal this time around as ive been before . I just feel broken and empty. Im trying my hardest now to pick myself up and get my life back on track ive given up weed gotten back into the gym and making an extra hard effort to find a job in my career field. I know we are all dealing with stuff which is why I don’t really tell anyone this as I don’t want to be a burden. Im hoping posting this here will help in some therapeutic way and I know this was a very long read so I dont expect many people to get through the whole thing but if you did thank you I know there will be better days a head i just hope they come soon. Much love to everyone who is struggling right now I hope you know you are not alone."

I lost my mom to cancer a month after I turned 21 in 2010 and spent most of my 20s in a dark place never really processing it in a healthy way. Fast forward to 2017 and thats when I hit an all time low becoming suicidal and hating the fact I would wake up and see another day. That became a real turning point for me I decided I really needed to get my life in order. Over the past few years that’s exactly what I did. I quit a job i hated and got my dream job.Started chasing a hobby I have loved since I was 9 but was too scared to ever try, lost over 40pounds, got myself outta debt and started a real savings account. Everything seemed and felt like I finally got my life on track and was heading into a great direction as I turned 30. I was becoming more social and really breaking outta my shell.

IcebreakingRice,2021-08-29 20:26:06+00:00,I'm alone and want to cry,"I'm alone and it hurts, physically. I'm alone, I was always alone, but the last two years were awful. I have no friends, never had, no acquaintances, no SO. I was ghosted by someone I considered somewhat a friend. I have nobody to talk to, I'm touch starved to the extent that I want to buy body length pillow and weighted blanket to mimic that even a little, but I don't have enough money. I'm too self-conscious about myself, both physically and mentally, and have too much social anxiety to actually meet someone new. i don't know if i even remember how to make friend after years of not having anyone.

I want to cry, all the time but I never allow myself, even when I'm alone. I wasn't allowed to cry like a child, because I was the responsible older sister. now I'm afraid to cry in front of anybody, to show that I'm weak. I don't want to show my weakness even to myself. I'm kinda still denying that I'm actually depressed because others are in a far worse situation. 

I just want to hug somebody and cry in front of them without  shame"
leighdotjpg,2021-08-29 18:09:41+00:00,Very quickly losing control.,"For a little while, I thought I was getting things back under control. I'm not so sure anymore.

I took LSD last night for the first time in a long time, and every other time i've taken it, I've woke up feeling refreshed, almost like i've been rebooted. But yesterday when I took it, it almost felt like it was out of desperation. I was already feeling terrible after my covid vaccine, I had managed to get myself into a shitty mindset, then suddenly I was dropping acid, doing cocaine and listening to music so loudly through headphones that I was absolutely unable to think. and of course, now i feel like shit. 

I feel so out of control of my life right now that i kind of want to just lean into the chaos, take a bunch of drugs and just end it all on a high note. My job is making me miserable, my family is making me miserable, and I'm so shit at relationships. It's like the impulsive behaviour is the very thing making me miserable, but it's the only thing that gives me any joy at the same time. I'm just breaking down bit by bit and i don't know how to handle it."
Van_Faith,2021-08-29 17:38:32+00:00,"Assuming that ""just be more happy"" cures depression &amp; i'm not valid.","i have been thinking a lot right now about people who are around me. i got the feeling that everytime i talk about death, possible afterlife and depression, the people around me act so superficial and want to change the topic asap. why do people do so? i mean isnt death as important as life? isnt mental health also important? for example. i had a conversation about how i feel and i said ""yeah i suffer from depression which comes and goes you know. sometimes its better, sometimes its worse. i know that i havent been to a doctor but i go to therapy soon i am on the waitlist."" and those people said ""ah yeah. intresting. wE bE HeRE FoR yOu :) laugh more :) be happy :) so btw did you saw doja cat's new song omg"". and they turn around and talk to the others again, ignoring me. do people really think that just ""staying happy"" is gonna cure me? i know that distraction is good but..why are they so shallow? is this common in our society? i have to say that i do not have as much contact  with them as i had before. yet we go still to the same high school and we walk together and i have with some of these people lessons together. yet these promises of ""being there for me"" are fake. i havent talk to them per phone since 2018 or so. we have been a group of six but now..i am alone. but do you know what also fucks me up? i heared that one of the girls in that group, shes pretty popular, had severe mental problems. and do you know what happened? EVERYBODY AROUND HER WANTED TO HELP HER. SO GENEROUS. ""oh my dear we gonna help you! we will be alway here for you"". and what about me? why did they ignored me? am i not valid enough to get help from them? maybe i didnt went shopping with them so often because i was afraid and i am more an introverted type which opens herself with the right people but i had no friends before and i fail in social interactions because i never learned how to talk right, you know. its hard for me to differentiate between ""ok thats sensitive and okay thats a common topic"". yet is this an excuse for leaving me behind? i just didnt wanted to hang out with them because i didnt fit there. but i dont wanted to be alone. yet still i do hang out with them just because dont want to be a bad person and say ""i dont want to hang out with anymore"". what i cannot understand is that when i didnt talked to them, didnt wrote them and was alone, i was labled as selfish, ignorant, egocentric even if i didnt showed them my depression and i played the happier version of me while being around them but..if this popular girl who was also in my group had isolated herself from others, posted photos of her on insta also faking her declining mental health situation, she was labeled as a person in pain, suffering, hurt. 

what i am trying to say is: why are people so superficial about depression, am i valid even if i have not 1000+ subscribers and people loving me?....and am i a bad person?"

GroundbreakingSpace1,2021-08-29 13:09:42+00:00,Do you guys feel like there are things you enjoy doing or does depression make it so you can't enjoy things?,"Trying to understand my own situation, because I don't understand if I just legitimately don't enjoy things or if it's because I'm depressed that I can't enjoy anything. Usually when other people talk about their depression it seems that people want to do things but cannot, a lot of people see things that they enjoy as coping mechanisms for dealing with their depression.

On the other hand, when I try to think of something that I enjoy or something that can distract me, or something I could try to attain to help me feel better I just cannot think of a single thing. Maybe it's because I'm so repressed that I don't realize there are things that are enjoyable, but it seems more like I don't know how to feel fun or excitement period. Consequently, I just go through every single day and every single year without a single 'up' moment, it's just same old same old, and the best I can hope for is that nothing that day puts me into an extremely negative mood.

It would be a lot easier if I could say hanging out with friends and going out on the town on the weekend is something I enjoy, and then just do that so I could temporarily feel happy. But there is just nothing like that for me."
Federal_Sympathy1399,2021-08-29 08:35:13+00:00,Feeling stuck.,"I’m in my early 20’s and almost done with my degree. I’m engaged and incredibly happy with my fiancé. 

BUT sometimes I feel stuck in my job and in the town we live in. I work a decent job that pays decent and works with my school schedule. But lately my job is wearing me down, my boss (40’s female) is such an asshole and rather lazy. I end up doing a lot of her job without the manager pay. I don’t like where I live, I ended up out here by something out of my control. Me and my fiancé will move after we graduate and I can’t wait. I know things get better, but man sometimes I’m just overwhelmed, school, work, and then having to catch up on errands and other responsibilities on my very few off days. It’s hard to find time in the day to set time aside to do what I like to do and get out of my own head. Anyway rant over, hope y’all are having a great weekend and things are going ok for y’all."

wonderhams,2021-08-29 07:12:57+00:00,I just don't know what to do anymore,"I hate my life and I don't know what to do or where to go anymore. Everything about my life is miserable. I go to a hard ass school that makes me realize how fucking dumb I am every day, even if I work full time hours I don't make enough money to survive and nothing has made me happy in years....

I go to school full time and work 30 hours a week, I literally have less than 18 hours of free time per week. All my job cares about is how much money I can gain them. I know the second my numbers drop that's it I'm fired. It's so stressful because I don't have mommy or daddy's credit card to get me through college, it's just me and whatever I get paid. 

I passionately hate myself and nothing I think can change that. I've given up on finding a relationship because I'm just not good enough and I'm sick of being hurt all the time. I've been cheated on and just disrespected and forgotten by everyone I've tried with. Having tinder and bumble isn't helping either because now I'm just getting rejected in live time and haven't even met up with anyone from these apps ever.

I can't even get therapy because I don't have time or money to do it. My life is consumed by my school and work and I have no time for anything else. I guess it never does get better.

I mean what's the point anymore? I hate school I hate my job I hate everything about myself so what do I do? I don't even think I'm gonna like my job out of high school because I get to deal with climate change the second I graduate since I'm getting a stem degree. At the end of the day my school just uses me so I can pay them. My job just wants to exploit a broke college student and nothing else in life seems worth it. I'm so uninterested in everything and I hate it. Honestly the only reason I haven't offed myself is because I care about my parents so much. I just wish I could die and have nobody remember me."
ArachnidInteresting,2021-08-29 05:15:47+00:00,I’m so sorry,"I’m so sorry for having to cause pain to the ones I loved so much.
My heart is so weak and today I talked to my best friend who’s also my ex and I still am in love with him. He has a new gf and I hope she takes care of him. I’ve thought about so many things and opened my mind. About how i was raped and used. How much it’s been causing me silent pain and trying my hardest to stay so strong. I needed a friend but I was isolated and in my isolation I started becoming more and more numb I drowned myself in pills hoping to ease the pain and I woke up no one knew I overdosed. No one knew. And again no one will know if I will ever be okay. But then next thing I know I’ll stop texting and no one cared when I was alive. Why do they care when I’m here. Where was everyone when I needed a friend. I saw my ex but I knew he didn’t want to be around me. I know he prefers his new gf and friends but it makes me happy that even if he claimed he’s un happy. That he has someone. He’s not alone. I thought about it and hoped that someone could hear my prays and take my pain away. But it won’t go away. I’m sitting out my window. It has no screen. I took about 5 Advil pills seeing if they would do anything but I want to run away. Start all over again. Im in constant pain that no one could understand. Im isolated and tired of being me. I might not see tomorrow I say and that’s okay. It’s okay to give up. It’s okay to let go."
Worried_Swing5258,2021-08-29 04:42:47+00:00,Worthless,"I honestly feel so awful about myself. I feel as if I’m a burden to friends and family, so much that I don’t even have a close connection to any of my loved ones. I try to combat the depression by thinking of things that I’m good at, but I realize I’m not good at anything. Everything I’ve ever tried I’m mediocre at. Some may say that it’s cool I can pick anything up and do it, but to me I realize I’ll never be needed, because I’m average. Someone else is always better than me, better looking than me, smarter than me, etc. I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m just a burden, waiting to drag someone down, because I can never be successful in life. I’ve come to the conclusion I don’t deserve someone to spend the rest of my life with, because there’s so many better looking people out there. I’ve just decided that I am ultimately useless, so I’d be better off gone, not wasting my parent’s money. Not wasting my friends time. Not wasting valuable resources like water and food. I am ultimately, a waste of flesh, time and space.

Earlier today my dad was wondering if I’d like to meet someone, just so I had another friendly face to wave to, and I told him I didn’t care, because ultimately it doesn’t matter to me if it’s a friendly face or not, because I feel nothing and everything is the same. He asked me how I felt about him and my mom, and I realized I felt the exact same way. They’re just people. And the worst part is I don’t care if they love me or not, because I don’t feel anything. 

All this leads me to the idea of being better off dead, and I just want someone to help me in anyway possible."

hellasickpepe,2021-08-29 04:06:08+00:00,Im so depressed,"I feel like a mess, i started spiralling 7pm last night and i haven’t been able to stop. I haven’t harmed myself in a while but i couldn’t stop yesterday, i feel as though i deserve all the pain in the world for my actions. The person i love the most ended our relationship 3 months ago and it has been a shit show for me mentally. I cant help but put all our problems as my own fault. I played a big part of our relationship ending as i lied to her and broke her trust numerous times. I honestly have no idea how i got here and how everything led to this. 

Ive spent the last three months trying to work on myself and taking accountability for everything I’ve done. Ive been in therapy every week, building new hobbies and routines for myself. I think from an outsiders perspective i have everything and I’m doing great. I have a job, i live in a huge city in a really nice apartment, but nothing matters when ive hurt the person i love so much terribly. I know she will never forgive me and our relationship will never be fixed. 

She asked me to leave her alone and be in no contact but i broke that a month ago after learning about how depressed she is. all i could think about is how she was there for me when i wanted to end everything a few years ago and i just wanted to be there for her. I broke no contact this weekend too, i wanted to talk to her one last time before i ended it all but she never replied. 

When i was finally ready to let go and end it the only thing that made me stop was my cat. i adopted a cat 4 months ago who is insanely undersocialized, has trauma and major anxiety. She hates everyone, gets scared by a lot of things and hisses a lot except when im around. i couldnt imagine the experience of her returning to a shelter only to not be adopted or something. i feel shitty i adopted a cat being so depressed and suicidal. 

i feel so alone, i dont think anyone really cares about me or my life. what little friends i have dont even like me because of my relationship ending and have sided with my ex. my own family doesnt even understand me and just destroy my will to live everytime i talk to them. im a trans person and theyve guilted me into stopping my medical transition and honestly not being on T and not being able to get top surgery is pushing me more and more to end it. the only person that supported me through all this is my ex and now she hates me and couldnt care less about me. 

i dont think im strong enough to keep going i feel so broken and i feel so mentally damaged that me not existing anymore would be beneficial to everyone around me."
Just_Neeks,2021-08-29 03:51:12+00:00,My birthday is soon and I’ll die three days after it,"I’ve never really liked my birthdays anyway as I fit older more truths Dane out to me, my mother doesn’t care at all about me. 
She admits it, she only cares for my siblings my dad doesn’t care either ma has us all wrapped around her finger. That’s lovely 
I turn 15. On September 5th my grandmother died from cancer three days after her birthday
I might as well do the same. But for a different reason 

I’m contemplating on whether or not I should do it. I don’t want to hurt my friends and my boyfriend who I care most about. I don’t want to hurt anyone

burner_account675,2021-08-29 02:25:11+00:00,Lost,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post this but I don’t know where else to go. I have just been so bored and depressed with my life. I’m not suicidal by any means, but I just don’t really have anything to look forward to. Love life isn’t there never really has been . Just meaningless hookups that I don’t even care to do anymore. I won’t go out of my way to try. Any girl that I think I like or get attached to and would actually put the effort into never works out so I’ve pretty much given up on that. Ive wanted to travel my whole life but I’m already 24 about to turn 25 and I feel that I’m too old.a lot of my friends are all moved around the country and now I feel alone: I don’t like my job but it pays good and has security. I want to move out of my home state but then I know I’d probably never do the traveling I want to. I used to love going out to party with my friends but now I just get drunk and get in my feels. I just feel so sunken at this point. I’m so lost at this point in my life."
VeryMentallyStable,2021-08-29 02:15:15+00:00,Being poor with mental issues feels like a death sentence,"I’ll preface this by saying, I’m not even in the US, where this stuff seems even worse, I’m in Australia, where we allegedly have “good healthcare”. The whole mental health system just seems impossibly stacked against you if you’re poor. It already feels ridiculously tough to overcome these issues without that barrier, think in an ideal situation with all factors accounted for, there’d still be a chance you might not ever recover. But if you’re broke it just feels impossible.

To start with it’s just a catch-22 already. I can’t hold down a job because of my issues but I can fix my issues without money. That alone makes me feel like giving up. But then when you think about the sheer amount of money you have to throw at things that aren’t even helpful half the time, it basically just becomes a sick joke. I can’t count how many times I’ve paid to see a mental health “professional” that actually left me feeling more confused and hopeless. 

At the moment I’m on day three of suffering through absolutely awful SSRI withdrawals because I couldn’t afford to get my meds renewed. My Lexapro was on the same script as my Lamictal. I’ve got a healthcare card that’s *supposed* to get me assistance with this stuff, but the pharmacy told me that Lamictal “isn’t covered”. I don’t even understand that, how can a very common mood stabilisers, one of the primary forms of treatment for Bipolar not be covered? It doesn’t even make sense to me. They told me it’d be $40 to get the script filled and that was for the generic version. I literally don’t have that money in my account so I just had to say no. It just seems so immoral.

And that’s not even to mention neither of those pills did anything for me. No intended effects, no side effects, no nothing. Same story with every single medication I’ve taken in the past and I’ve been at this for years. Makes me wonder if I’m even being treated for the right things. After all, depending on which psychiatrist you ask, I have Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Type 2, BPD, PTSD, C-PTSD, anorexia, substance abuse disorder and probably more I’m forgetting. Seems like my diagnosis changes with the wind. I’ve seen 3 psychiatrists, all about a year apart because I just couldn’t afford to go more often than that or go back to the same one twice. First guy said it was just the depression with maybe some BPD. Second said BPD with possible Bipolar and PTSD or C-PTSD. Third barely listened to me and said it’s definitely Bipolar for purely genetic reasons and maybe some BPD traits. I’m just lost at this point and I can’t afford to keep going back to get clarity.

Only reason I can get in to see a therapist now is because I’m on welfare and you can get a few free appointments. But even that’s no help because the guy they’ve sent me to, honestly, is dumber than a sack of bricks. I’m sure he means well, but he’s not gonna be able to help me. And I can’t afford anyone better. And even when I could, the CBT specialists, DBT specialists, EMDR specialists, all seemed to be basically the same. None of it helped and again, it took up all my money just to get in the door so I didn’t have the luxury of trying again afterwards.

I just don’t get it. Even my GP is throwing up her hands at this point saying there’s really no options left. I just feel untreatable, I mean I’m clearly already pretty treatment resistant as it is, so if I can’t even shop around until I get someone good or even feel confident I’ve got the right diagnosis, what hope is there? How does someone like me ever get better? I can’t even afford my goddamn meds anymore. This is just awful."

sports in general- did sports carnivals at school every time there was one and trained my hardest but get beaten by people a year or two younger than me.

im sick of it, i have no friends and have no passion for anything, i just wish i wasnt some scumfuck pile of shit that could do something other than cry about how shit they make their own situation when its my own fault. i am not attractive either as much as i try to keep good hygiene and try to be the nicest i can be in most situations, no girl ever wants to talk to me or anyone in that matter. occasionally someone will tell me hello or hi and i start to tear up from happiness. i get brushed off in most situations and it just makes me realise no matter how nice i am im just never wanted in any friend group and i dont even know why, i always find myself constantly doubting myself for nothing because i try my hardest and still fail.

does anyone have any experience with this and would be able to give me advice on how to fix my problem because ive fucking had enough."
darth_ewok_vader,2021-08-28 23:46:02+00:00,Last times,"I decided to stay friends with my ex. And tonight we video called and spoke a little, mainly just looking at each other, but it made me more sad than I already was. He's so beautiful and such a kind hearted soul. I realized that it would probably be the last time we did that. I feel like we're having a lot of lasts. When I look at him I smile, but I also think of the future that we were supposed to have that is no longer a possibility. And it destroys me inside

I've been up for about an hour now just thinking of him and that. Just mourning it a bit I guess. Soon enough will probably go from friends to nothing and I need to start preparing for that.

 He became my best friend and boyfriend, I already lost my boyfriend, I dont want to lose my best friend too, but this is extremely painful for me

We used to sleep on call every night and it was one of the most comforting and peaceful things for me. I always felt best when I went to bed with him right on call with me, hearing him fall asleep as I did too

It's all these things and a lot more that Im mourning now I guess. I planned to grow old with him, to have a family with him, to do everything with him. Now it's all gone and we're ""friends"". I can never only be friends with him, I love him way too much for that

I am slowly getting more and more sad each day as well as getting anxious and feeling sick. The situation is very complicated and has made me throw up already and have multiple breakdowns over the last 4 weeks

I feel like Ive lost my person and I can never get them back now"

DecentlyPlausible,2021-08-28 21:29:43+00:00,A few days into Wellbutrin plus Prozac,"So, I've been on 300 mg of Wellbutrin for a few years now.  My depression has gotten worse recently, and my psychiatrist has added Prozac to my daily medications.  I think I started it maybe 5 days ago.

I think I'm less depressed, but I'm also feeling... dumber?  Kinda not-with-it?  A couple of days into it I was driving on the highway, and about 10 miles in my brain just went ""Whoa, we're driving?  How did this happen?!""  I didn't freak out or anything, but it's like the part of my brain that processes continuity fell asleep on the job and woke up in a hurry.  And today I actively watched (in a rather stupified fashion) about 45 minutes of a video of The Prevue Channel from 1990 on YouTube before I snapped back into awareness.  I don't even remember thinking during that time.  Which means either I wasn't thinking, or I don't remember thinking.

On the plus side my appetite has gone down, so this is still way better so far than Zoloft was.

Is this normal on the early stages of Prozac?  Does it eventually get better?"

I think im just tired of everything I deleted everything I had as social media cuz I was tired of seeing it. On top of all that I been feeling so numb and today is the hardest day, im running out of Prozac so I have to get more but im afraid to get more because I feel like I’ll overdose again, I took 15 Prozac pills each 40mg and to my surprise I threw up but I’ve heard that even throwing up might still kill you, so I just left a note and told my best friend to listen to the song that I want to be remembered by he doesn’t know anything that’s been going on, and I woke up today, feeling numb. I want to try again and hope it ends the pain."

BrokenBustedBrain,2021-08-28 12:37:21+00:00,"I just want to be dead, words can’t describe how badly the suffering hurts","I can’t even cry anymore. I’m just suffering. Every second is painful. This is torturous. I can’t even put it into words. There just are none, I hurts so badly, please, I just want it to end.

I don’t know why I can’t kill myself, I’m just stuck in this bed. I just want to die. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow, I don’t want to have any more experiences I don’t want anything, I just want to die. I don’t know what to do. I’m just laying here hoping I can somehow think my organs to death. 

I don’t understand why nothing works. None of the therapies or medications or any of it, none of it works. I just keep getting worse and worse and now here I am and I just want so desperately to die. 

My latest therapist told me to download an app for when I’m suicidal. I tried to download it tonight and it just hammered home that I want to kill myself. You have to go through all these step, fill out thing like “what are you warning signs?” and “what activities can you do right now?” and stuff like that. I got to the field that said “My reasons to live” and I just didn’t have anything to write. I sat there for ages trying to think of something, but there’s nothing. Then there was another field, “People and places I can connect with”. Again, I just have nothing. Next field “people I can talk to”. I can’t put down a single name. Not one. There’s no one. I just want to die. That’s what this tells me. I have nothing worth living for and I just want to die.

I can’t connect with people, no matter how alone I feel, being around people just makes me feel more alone. I’m broken. I can’t hold down a job or anything either. I can’t drive. I can’t kill myself. I can’t even manage to goddamn cry. I’m untreatable. Even my doctors don’t really have any ideas left. I just should be here so why can’t I just kill myself? I want to die, please, I just want to be dead."

After my most recent mental break I’ve noticed that I’ve been pulling the hairs that grow right along my hair line near my forehead. It’s not too much yet but now when I feel along there’s so many new baby hairs (I’ve never have baby hairs there before) and tiny little spiky bois that are growing back in and I have to try so HARD to resist the urge to get a pair of tweezers and pull them out :("

BrokenBustedBrain,2021-08-28 09:23:32+00:00,Why am I such a genetically failed human being?,"I’m a walking goddamn mistake. I should never have existed. Born to two people who were so mentally ruined I don’t know why they ever thought having a kid together would produce anything but a genetic abomination. But that did it anyway and here I am. 

I’m so ruined, even doctors can’t figure out what’s wrong with my head. The list of disorders I’ve had stapled on me is so goddamn long. Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, PTSD, C-PTSD, anorexia, substance abuse disorder, and probably others I’m forgetting. Maybe it’s none of them cause the treatments don’t work either. CBT, DBT, EMDR, dozens upon dozens of mood stabilisers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, none of it did anything. The therapy was all just words. The pills didn’t have any effect at all, not even a single damn side effect, nothing.  I’m just so goddamn treatment resistant and it’s sucked up what little money I had left. Can’t even afford the meds anymore. Have to quit them cold turkey later this week because I don’t have a choice.

I’m so goddamn alone in the world. I’ve basically *always* been alone. I can’t connect to people, I just can’t. Being around them makes me feel more alone. I can’t do it. I’m too broken. I hate that so many people seem to have someone and I’m just cursed to think about how much I want the same, but know I’ll never be able to. It’s probably a good thing. If I ever, by some miracle, managed to get into a relationship, it would be a complete disaster. I’m way too unstable. No one should have to deal with someone who’s covered in self harm scars, constantly battling slipping back into multiple addictions, constantly suicidal and so goddamn treatment resistant all anyone can do is stand there and watch while I self-destruct over and over and try not to kill myself in the process. But it still hurts reading about people on here talking about their s/o or seeing it in films and shit. It’s inescapable and it’s torture.

I’ll never have a family, the one I was born with is nothing but poison and I can’t have a wife or a kid cause there’s no way I’m procreating with my genetics. Not to mention I’d traumatise the hell outta them just by being around.

I’ll never have any of the things I want, like my own house or even a car or the ability to learn new hobbies like woodworking and metalworking and stuff like I’ve always wanted to because I’ll never have enough money because I can’t hold down a fucking job. Once again, I’m just too unstable. Having a job for more than six months either pushes my into such a deep depression I start self-harming, slipping into addiction or trying to kill myself, puts me into such a severely dissociative state that I barely know where I am and can’t hear people talking to me or just flat out puts me into full-blown psychosis. Either way, it’s the same result, gotta quit or I get fired.

It’s not like I don’t try. I still somehow manage to exercise everyday, cook for myself, shower, even make my damn bed every morning because I read that was supposed to help somehow. I really did try all the suggestions from therapists too, the journaling, the meditation, the mindfulness, the breathing exercises, but none of it helped. I really did try but it made no difference.

I’m just garbage, just genetic garbage. Nothing and no-one can help me. I’m just ruined. I should never have existed and I’m so messed up that now that I do exist, I can’t even kill myself properly."

2timey,2021-08-28 08:17:10+00:00,This is a joke.,"I’m realizing that life is just inherently bad. There is no pot of gold at the end of this imaginary rainbow. Life is just a series of unfortunate events. Nothing really helps, nothing fixes anything or makes it better. Alcohol, drugs, sex, love, therapy, medicine… its all a bunch of temporary fixes to keep people surviving and miserable just because we “shouldn’t” kill ourselves. We are supposed to be unhappy &amp; unfulfilled until we just die off. I am over it. I am done with this facade of happiness &amp; positivity. Things just don’t get better. Some people’s lives are just bad and that’s just how it is. No amount of effort will ever truly fix anything. It’s all a bunch of “coping mechanisms” that are just meant to delay the inevitable."

Seriously nothing. No intended effects, no side effects, nothing at all. It was like I’d never taken them. But a couple days ago I went to renew my scripts. One for 20mg of Lexapro and one for 300mg of Lamictal. I was told by the pharmacy that they weren’t gonna be cover by my welfare card and it would cost me $40 to get them. I don’t have $40 so I’ve had no choice but to come off them, don’t know what else I could’ve done. 

But now, despite the fact that they did nothing while they were in my system, they’re coming out of my system and I feel terrible.

MyBrainsInPain,2021-08-28 04:05:57+00:00,Think I’m just untreatable. Don’t know why I can’t just fucking die already…,"Guess I lost the genetic dice roll. Cause I’m completely fucked and nothing helps. CBT, DBT, EMDR, all the therapies, they’re all just fucking words. Just useless words. Words can’t help. Meds can’t help either. Been on dozens and dozens of the fucking things. They do nothing, nothing at all. Not even one measly fucking side effect. Doesn’t matter if it’s antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, they’re all the fucking same, they do nothing.

Therapists just end up throwing their hands up after long enough. They can’t help me, don’t know how I guess. Think my GP is getting to the same point after years of throwing meds at me and having them do nothing. Wonder if she even believes me.

It’s not like I don’t try. I still manage to exercise every day, still manage to cook for myself even though I never want to eat, still manage to at least try to do hobbies, even if they just frustrate me too much now cause I can’t focus. I’ve really tried all the suggestions too. Meditation, mindfulness, breathing exercises, journaling and all that shit, I mean fuck, I *wanted* it work. But none of it fucking does. Not one bit. 

Kicked my addictions too, for all the fucking good it did. Haven’t done drugs for 6 months, haven’t self-harmed for 4 months, haven’t had alcohol for 3 months. Doesn’t make any difference though. Only became an addict cause none of treatments were working. Just said fuck it and started set-medicating instead. Did it help? Not really, but it did make me numb. Liked being numb. Passed the time at least, made me feel like I didn’t have to rush towards dying, might just be able to wait for it to happen on it own. But now I’ve stopped cause two people I’ll tentatively say were friends convinced me to. But then they fucked off outta my life and I relapsed. Didn’t last long cause now it pumps me full of so much guilt I don’t even have the option of getting numb anymore. So I’ve stopped for good, I guess. And people pat you on the fucking back over it, acting like it matters at all. Acting like you’re out the other side of hell, even though you’re stuck in the worst hell you’ve ever been in cause now you have zero solutions just like before, but less options. Tell you “you should be proud” like you can even feel proud. Like them saying they’re proud or that you should be means anything to me, like it fucking translates at all.

Used to at least want things. Now I don’t even fucking care. Used to want to have someone to end the crippling fucking loneliness. Knew I couldn’t get it because I can’t connect with people, don’t even know why, just can’t. Knew people always just made me feel *more* alone. But I still wanted *someone*, even if it was a pipe dream. But now I don’t fucking care. Sounds like effort, energy I just don’t have. Couldn’t have friends or a girlfriend anyway. Too unstable. Who wants to be around someone who can go from being fine the last time you spoke to them to being completely fucked and suicidal the next? And even when I’m “fine” now, it just an act, a fucking facade that eventually I won’t have the energy to keep up. Been years since I was anything but horrifically, suicidally depressed. Probably good I can’t connect to people.

Anyway don’t even know why I’m bothering to type this. No therapist or medication can help, no one here’s gonna be able to. Guess it’s just to vent. To just announce I’ve given up. Tried to get my meds today, got told they’re “not covered” by my pension card. Would’ve cost me $40 for 28 days worth. Can’t afford it. Just fucking broke. One of the side effects of my diseased brain, can’t hold down a fucking job. Working for more than about 6 months either makes me so depressed I start self-harming, drinking or having suicide attempts, makes me catatonically dissociative so I barely know where I am and can’t hear people talking to me or it just puts me into a full-blown psychosis. Either way, the result is the same, either get fired or have to quit. So my bank accounts are empty from all the failed treatments and worthless medications. So I’m just stopping, don’t really have a choice. Just not renewing my scripts. Coming off the meds, don’t give a shit if I’m on the highest dose for both. Don’t have a choice. I just fucking give up."

I don't know the people I asked, they added me as friends years ago and I had spoken to them for years. Male and female, from America, the UK and even Muslim countries.

I was also told that gay men are more opnley disgusted by vaginas than lesbians are by penises, that vaginas are seen as more gross and taboo, more joked about and made fun of while penises are more normalised. (Feminists online always say vaginas are seen negatively, so they must have to get that belief from somewhere)

I was also told women dislike their vaginas more than men dislike their penises (men mostly like or love their own)

I was told anime fans and gamers love feminized men, traps and futa and penises on women or femininity more than women.

I was told it's common for men in Muslim countries to have sex with men before marriage due to gender segregation and sexual repression, and for them to see it as not gay to ""top"" (I only thought it was a small minority who did that, now i'm not so sure.)

And I was told everybody wants to be young, look young and is youth obsessed and that old are seen as inferior and that you look worse and become invisible with age.

How true are all these things for the majority &amp; in general? I am young and learning about men from online for the time being, so I am wondering these things."

He was very emotionally abusive the last year and a half we were together, he totally destroyed my confidence, and I feel like I don’t know who I am. It’s been some time since our break up and I’ve been single and I’ve also tried dating but no matter what I do I feel like I’m not really here. I live alone with my pets and my apartment is a wreck and I feel so defeated and embarrassed. My depression has been a problem before we broke up but it’s been especially worse after the fact. My grandfather also passed away in March from a terrible car accident and I don’t think I’ve properly taken time to grieve. I just feel lost, alone, and just feel like I’m in autopilot all the time. My friends say I can talk to them but I feel like a burden and that I’m the least important friend in the group and none of them actually care. I just could really use some advice on how to feel better if anyone has the time."

MelancholicMel,2021-08-27 14:22:19+00:00,Final words,"So... Its the third or fourth time I'm trying to write this... Its no easy task to write down our final thoughts so openly to the world like this... How can I even conceive to try to justify such unjustifiable act that is to take my own life? I don't think I can express but a fraction of the feelings and thoughts that are racing through me in this moment!

How do I even start this thing? My suicide note. Should I start telling a little bit of my story? How I was born into a very poor family and that I am an only child? Or should I skip ahead when I was raped by a local priest of my city and my sitter? Or Should I skip to just a few months ago when my fiancé left me just a few days after I lost my teaching job at the university? ""you never smile"" she sayd! She's right... I don't. 

All of those would be good reasons for the choice I'm making, but those are not the reason... Debt is what hurts me the most... I owe a lot of money to a hospital and student loans, I can't pay rent and for that I'm getting evicted from my house... Gonna become homeless soon, that's the worst fate anyone could have.

I wonder how the first night sleeping in the streets will feel like... Watching people pass by ignoring me... Will some of them take pity and throw nickels at me? I don't know, I guess now I won't find out.

You see, I am a selfish person, taking my own life like this is proof of that. It was always been about me; MY ptsd, My depression, My bipolar disorder... It has always been about me... Its impossible to be selfless when you're too busy trying to survive... When you're just a husk of a men, trying to make it through another day.

Truth be told is that I failed! I failed as a teacher, failed as a fiancé, failed as a friend and as a son... I've been a burden on the life of others for so long and now it's about to be over and ill have peace.

To you, fellow redditor, I say... Remember to love! Love each other, love your partners, call them and tell them how much you love them... Call your families, embrace them... Love heals everything! I lived a loveless life and am an exemple of the fate that is set upon people like me. Remember what the funny little man sayd? ""you carry the love of humanity in your hearts, you don't hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and unnatural!"".

So love, enjoy life and all the beauty in this world

Goodbye!"

yksjysjys,2021-08-27 09:04:14+00:00,Just trying to bury myself in work,"Life just feels hopeless. And not in the conventional sense. I am a grad student and I'm doing pretty well. I like my work. I have good friends. I'm economically well off. And I think I'm an empathetic person and I try to be there for everyone even if I'm feeling like shit myself. But I'm having a difficult time mentally. I'm not suicidal, but life seems pointless. I don't have anyone to care for which I think could be a reason why I'm feeling so down. My relationship with my family feels very fake. They care about me, but it feels like the way one would care about some far off relative. 

I have penpals with whom I share some of my feelings. One of them particularly is a very nice person and we exchange emails almost on a daily basis. I'm glad she's there, but I don't want to burden her with all of my problems. She even sent me chocolates a couple of days ago which was very sweet. I hope she gets whatever she wants from life. 

I'm not officially diagnosed with depression because I haven't been to therapy yet. I don't know if I should. I can afford it, but I'm having a hard time admitting that I am not strong enough to fix myself. Fuck!!!

I'm awake at 5 in the fucking morning. I slept for 3 hours last evening. I was in the lab all the time before then and I was back at the lab again after that. I don't have any interest in watching TV or reading books or anything outside my work for that matter. I haven't had any alcohol in over a week. Even when I drink, it's just a beer or two. I think it's time I go to therapy and see if I can make any progress. 

Well, thanks for reading so far. I appreciate that. I just wanted to rant somewhere and can't think of places other than here. My journal wouldn't be satisfying enough.

BadCaseOfBrainShakes,2021-08-27 07:34:53+00:00,Why kicking my addictions doesn’t fucking matter,"Hate life. Hate being here on this fucking planet. Have for as long as I can remember which I guess is why I started drinking all the time, doing heaps of drugs, and cutting myself. Did it help? No, not really. But it did pass the time. Made me feel like I could see myself just waiting to die rather than feeling like I was always a month or two away from killing myself.

But now I’ve stopped all that shit. Haven’t done drugs for about 6 months. Haven’t self-harmed for 4. Haven’t had any alcohol for 3. Did it cause it’s all you fucking hear as an addict, shit like “you gotta stop, you’ll feel so much better!”, and “you’ll never get where you need to be while you’re doing that shit!”. And maybe it’s even true in some cases.

Think the thing people forget is, I did that shit because I hate being alive. Suicide didn’t just feel like it was in the cards, it felt like it was the whole fucking deck. Like my next draw was it, I could delay it, but it was fucking inevitable. 

The therapists couldn’t help. Not DBT or CBT or EMDR or fucking any of them. It was all just fucking words at the end of the day. I’d take the suggestions, journaling, meditation, breathing exercises, the fucking mindfulness and practice ‘em, I mean really try, for at least a month, but still, sweet fuck all in the results column. 

Pills were the same. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, didn’t fucking matter. When through dozens and dozens of the fucking things. None of them did anything, not a fucking thing. Not even one pesky fucking side effects. Zilch.  

So then I started self-medicating. Maybe it’s just cause I was so fucking numb all the time I just couldn’t tell how much I was suffering but I felt better. At least in ways. Didn’t have relationships to ruin, and for sure didn’t start new ones, but I could at least tolerate talking to people. Could tolerate being at work, can’t do that normally. Shame it’s hard to go unnoticed doing that shit at work though so I still couldn’t *hold* a job. Made a couple things better at least.

But then I stopped. Cause people I used to know told me I should. Only they fucked off outta my life and I relapsed. Then I stopped again cause those fucking people have instilled their fucking ideas in my head now and I can’t escape the fucking guilt and shame anymore and addiction is basically ruined for me. Thanks, fuckers.

But now I’m worse than ever. The medication still doesn’t do a fucking thing. Therapy is still just fucking useless words. Everything still fucking sucks and I still think about killing myself 24/7. Still exercise everyday, eat well, try to do shit, but it doesn’t fucking help one iota. And now one of my only options, becoming an addict to numb it all away, is gone cause of the fucking guilt. 

And the fucking therapists and shit just pat you on the back and tell you how fucking “proud” you should be for kicking the addictions. Like it fucking matters. Like them being proud translates to you in any fucking way. Like you don’t constantly wish you could throw the guilt away and go right back to it. Like it’s made any fucking difference in your life whatso-fucking-ever. They just act like you made it through hell when in reality, you’re caught in the worst fucking hell yet. And then they dust off their fucking hands and act like the hard works all done, at least the bulk of it. But it fucking isn’t. Feels like I’ve lost ground, like I’m a few steps *before* square one now. 

I just fucking hate this shit. I don’t understand what my brain is fucking waiting for by not letting my just up and kill myself. I don’t know why the fuck I can’t do it when it’s all I wanna do, when I don’t have any fucking hope and I don’t fucking care if it’ll “get better one day”."

But in the past 6 months it’s like someone pulled the plug on my life and all feelings of hope and happiness of swirled down the drain. I don’t have anxiety, I don’t have crippling depression. I just feel like nothing has any meaning anymore. I don’t feel like doing anything. I just sit and pass the time. 

I used to love hiking, walking, getting out and just moving around. I used to love making art, or being productive with my time. Now it just doesn’t seem appealing anymore. Ever since I turned 30 I just lost all fascination with life. I feel like a shell of the person I once was. 

I stopped smoking marijuana recently and think that’s probably part of it, but I just don’t enjoy life anymore. 

I feel really guilty because there’s plenty in my life to be thankful for. I have a decent career and am ok with money. My family is alive and well. I’m not bad looking. So many people have it worse than me and I feel like a piece of garbage for not being able to enjoy myself with the gifts I have. 

I’m single, which I think is part of the problem. I get super lonely and feel that I am wasting my life alone. 

I’ve gone to some therapy and I guess it helped a little bit. But not in any really profound way.

ILoveMaiV,2021-08-26 23:28:14+00:00,"Since i was a kid, I'd get depressed by the most random things and just felt like writing them out to see if anyone can relate.","I tend to get really sad by the most random things. I've been like this since i was a kid.

Since i was young, as a kid, far back as i can remember. I've had times where i felt really down, it's caused by the most random things. I just wanted to post this, i've never been diagnosed or anything but i'm sure i'm depressed. I had a normal life and a normal childhood but i genuinely have days where i just don't feel like moving.

Here's just a list. Seeing or hearing the theme song to tv shows i watched as a kid, but only certain series. Not every childhood show makes me sad. 

Thinking about how i used to collect wrestling figures and don't have any of them anymore. Same with a special gift someone got me for my birthday one year, i held onto it for years. But the storage place sprung a leak and i didn't get it out in time before it rained.

Stuffed animals, they all had stories and character when i was a kid. I never took any of them anywhere because i was afraid i'd lose them.

Smiling logo's and mascots. This is just an odd one, any of those products that have happy mascots. Like most cereal mascots, or the old McDonald's Kids Meal cups with Ronald grinning on the side. I see one of those characters and just get caught up in it, like i can't look away. Then i cry.

My birthday is always the one thing guaranteed to get a cry out of me.

That time i stepped on an ant hill and seeing the ants inside scurrying out.

One time, i was in a thrift store, i saw a dollhouse. It was empty, there was one figure inside though. She was in the kitchen, sat at a table. She was alone and i just got to thinking about it, i imagined sitting at that table by myself, for some reason i imagined it was her birthday and nobody showed up.

I also have moments where i can't stop thinking about my idol, how much i want to tell her what she means to me and how she impacted my life, but i'll never get to meet her. PLus the fact she'd probably hate me if we ever met.

This is just a sample, there's a lot of things i can think of that can turn the best days into the worst."

The most recent one knew how hard my past has been and promised he wouldn’t hurt me. But in the end he broke up with me over text, 2 weeks before he was supposed to move in to be with someone else. I WFH and am successful both in my job and hiding how I miserable I am from my coworkers. But I am so alone. I am not just alone, I am lonely. I am afraid that I will never find anyone, I will never have kids, and my life will never have real meaning.

justdgs,2021-08-26 20:21:30+00:00,For anyone feeling a bit shit right now…,"TLDR; Don’t panic or feel disheartened - keep your head up.

This may well get buried but to anyone who happens to see it (even one of you would make me feel like I made a difference)… 

Whatever your answer to this, don’t beat yourself up for not having what you want. And don’t compare yourself to anyone else whose answers may make you feel worse/jealous/a failure/etc. And that includes people in real life.

We all have an unhealthy obsession of hitting milestones - whether it’s achieving them early or if they continue to seem like a distant impossible dream. I am hugely guilty of it myself and have experienced both. And it does NOT matter what age you are. 

Aiming for a goal is a healthy thing to do. It can give you drive, confidence, and purpose. But you can *easily*  get lost in it.

Becoming a young billionaire would be **INCREDIBLE**!! But you could get hit by a bus at 26.

Being older and owning a mansion with 10 bedrooms and a pool is great… unless all of that is empty. Because your ‘normal’ friends can’t drop everything to enjoy what you can.

Getting married, having kids, and owning a house and a good car is great… unless it means you have no spare time or energy to see any of your friends and you get stuck in a life you were never prepared for.

The ideal ‘milestones’ go on…

As long as you can enjoy yourself in your downtime - if it’s splashing out on a meal or just sitting on the sofa watching shit TV or playing video games… you do you.

Because you never know what will happen in one, five, ten years from now. I’m just a random on the internet giving advice I think and hope might help.

Take a deep breath. And if you did read (DR):

redditerX75,2021-08-26 18:11:30+00:00,30 Things People Said That Were Actually Code for 'I'm Depressed',"  
 When you’re struggling with depression, most of the time, *you know*. The problem is, those around you may not. That’s because many of the symptoms of depression are “invisible.” So when depression appears to you, others may still think you’re “fine.”  

# Here is what they had to say:

## 1. “I don’t feel well.”

“It is such a simple and vague statement but can hide so much behind it. I say this when I’m not entirely sure of what I’m feeling, but know my depression and anxiety are acting up worse than usual or if my brain is attacking me. It is so much simpler to say I’m not feeling well than trying to explain everything else going on.” — Kathryn W.

## 2. “I’m just tired.”

“Or when I go off the radar. I’m usually very responsive on my phone and social media. I may just cover it up with ‘I’m just tired.’” — Mandy M.

## 3. “I need to go/visit someplace new/I want to travel.”

“Variants of this can sometimes be a sign that I’m stuck in a depressive bubble and need an out, even if that’s going to a place nearby for a day or two. So far I’ve only experienced one person catching on to this, but usually people only respond with, ‘Yeah, I want to go to \[insert place\]’ or something like that.” — Ole H.

## 4. “I’m not doing well today.”

“I try to be authentic by saying, ‘I’m not doing well today’ and trust in being vulnerable. But sometimes when I’m asked, ‘How are you today?’ I will respond, ‘Medium’ when I really mean ‘Terrible.’ I secretly hope they decipher my codes and hidden meanings, but I have realized it rarely works. So, I am trying to just be authentic and not ashamed of my depression.” — John M.

## 5. “I’m surviving.”

“In response to the question ‘How’s it going?’ I sometimes simply say, ‘It’s going,’ or, ‘I’m surviving.’” — Jackie R.

## 6. “I’m hanging in there.”

“When people ask how I’m doing, this is the only socially appropriate answer that implies that things aren’t easy right now. ‘Hanging on by a thread’ would be the ‘honest’ translation.” — Elizabeth R.

## 7. “I’m so exhausted.”

“No matter how much actual sleep I get, whether I’m up all night thinking and crying or I have managed to actually cry myself to sleep early — I’m still constantly exhausted.” — Sara E.

## 8. “I feel so frustrated and angry.”

“Most people don’t realize anger, instead of sadness, can be the main symptom of depression.” — Kristen F.

## 9. “I feel ‘off’ or ‘incorrect.’”

“I tell my therapist all the time I feel ‘off’ or ‘incorrect.’ He knows me though so he is aware of the signs when my depression gets worse. People in my life, which are few, don’t seem to pay attention.” — Charlotte C.

## 10. “You don’t understand, no one understands.”

“I say this when I’m trying to explain that statement to my boyfriend is so hard, because deep down he wants to understand exactly what I am going through but finds it so difficult when I push him away instead and go quiet while hiding away and avoiding eye contact. I just wish it was easy to explain the situation when I have a bad reaction.” — Shone D.

## 11. “I have a migraine.”

“I would always say this when I was too depressed to do anything. I felt like physical pain was more accepted than mental pain.” — Jasmine B.

## 12. “I have it handled.”

“This is my go-to when I am overwhelmed, don’t have enough help and I feel as if my world is going to come crashing in on itself. It is always, ‘Just leave me alone. I have it handled.’” — Julia N.

## 13. “I can’t go to class.”

“I’m in college and some days I can’t get out of bed and I can’t leave the dorm, so walking to campus seems like the most impossible task in the world.” — Wes H.

## 14. I’ve just been so busy lately!

“Code for: I’ve been too depressed to even consider making plans outside of anything else that is absolutely necessary.” — Morticia A.

## 15. “I’m here.”

“I’m here — as in I’m barely existing and I just don’t have the extra energy to do much. Very rarely will someone catch on.” — Savanna S.

## 16. “My back hurts.”

“When I have bad depressive episodes, my whole body hurts like I was trampled by horses, especially my back because I already have a bad spine.” — Jaclyn R.

## 17. “I’m not hungry.”

“I love to eat, so when I lose my appetite you know something’s wrong.” — Hayley T.

## 18. “It’s been a long day.”

“To some, that may seem relatively self-explanatory, but a long day for me means I’ve been in fight-or-flight mode, or struggling not to have a breakdown, or on the verge of tears while arguing with myself in my mind all day while plastering a fake smile on for my family.” — Amber M.

## 19. “Others are going through much worse.”

“Sometimes the guilt I feel for feeling down is overwhelming because I know so many others out there are dealing with worse. And when I think about all the bad things in the world, it brings me down that much more. It’s a weird cycle and I know I’m not being completely honest with myself when I respond this way. But it’s the only way I know how to answer sometimes without just wearing a mask (which also isn’t healthy). It’s not so much about the answer I’m giving the person asking, but rather about telling myself to just suck it up, which works sometimes, but makes me feel like an empty liar at other times.” — Kristi M.

## 20. “I have no life.”

“I say this a lot when I’m having a rough time. I feel I haven’t accomplished much at my age. Everyone I know is going on trips and working their dream jobs. The only thing I’ve accomplished was having my boys and even then I feel I’m failing at that.” — Cora-Lee H.

## 21. “I’m bored/I need to get out for a bit.”

“I don’t think people understand that it’s my way of distracting myself from my thoughts. I’m going through therapy to help learn to not have to depend on others.” — Jennifer E.

## 22. “Hey, do you want to hang out?”

“I have a hard time admitting when I’m in a bad place, so asking to hang out or get out of the house (anything really) is good for me. I’m glad I have some friends who let me run boring errands with them on days like this.” — Gina G.

## 23. “My soul is tired.”

“That was the one where I knew I meant I was losing hope and spiraling. That one was when I was closest to making a life-ending decision.” — Samantha B.

## 24. “I hate everything.”

“This is usually met with annoying responses like, ‘Well do you hate your cats? Do you hate candy? Do you hate me?’ It’s not that I actually hate everything. It’s just my roundabout way of admitting that I’m depressed and nothing seems OK.” — Elizabeth M.

## 25. “We don’t want to do it at my house, it’s a mess.”

“Or, ‘Let’s take your car, mines dirty,’ because I’m ashamed that I can never seem to find the energy to take care of myself or my belongings anymore.” — Karina W.

## 26.  “I’m too tired to shower right now, maybe in the morning.”

“Most of the time I’m not actually tired, but the thought of taking care of myself when all I want is to sleep is exhausting enough to leave me saying that I’m just too tired to wash my hair or brush teeth.” – M.K.

## 27. “The goblins are being jerks today.”

“I have been using ‘goblins’ for anxiety and bipolar issues as a way to give an image to something I’m fighting. Makes it easier.” – Saylor A.

## 28. “Am I a good person?”

“I feel like I seek value from those I love more when I’m depressed because I feel so dehumanized and as though I’m a burden when I get to be that way. It’s exhausting because then I feel super toxic asking such silly questions.” – Carly Z.

## 29. “I just need a break.”

“Usually because I’m feeling overwhelmed, unable to focus and work through the fog that’s descended due to my anxiety and depression.” – Cydney D.

## 30. “I’m fine, but how are you?”

“I am a really great actress when I’m depressed so when I don’t want to talk about me I turn it back to them and excitedly chatter about what’s going on in their life. They’re usually excited by my question so they forget to follow up with me.” – Amanda A.H."
Beginning-Control46,2021-08-26 17:01:27+00:00,Is it me?,I’ve spent all of my energy being there for everyone that I feel selfish being there for myself. That my feelings are just me feeling sorry for myself and that’s what I’m told when I try talking to those that I’ve always been there outlet. We moved across the country to be close to “friends and family” but I have never felt so alone. When I try to talk to any of them or initiate us hanging out I’m the needy one and the one who brings everyone down when I talk about my problems. Idk what to do anymore. Feel like my life is the butt of the universes joke and there’s so many more years left of this misery.
depressed_addict,2021-08-26 16:41:59+00:00,Pregnancy Fixed my Depression?,"Hey guys,

This is kind of a strange topic to bring up, but it's something I've been wrestling with for awhile now. I have struggled severely with depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and self-harm since the age of 14. I had 3 suicide attempts during my high school years and starting missing school because of panic attacks. I ended up missing so many days that I became truant and had to repeat my junior year. During this time period, I tried many different types of treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy, every type of SSRI or SNRI you can think of. I stayed at in-patient treatment centers for months at a time. Nothing worked for me. Nothing worked that is, until I accidentally got pregnant at 17. 

When I found out I was pregnant, my mental state completely transformed. I decided to keep my baby, and suddenly I changed from being completely focused on myself, to focusing on my baby. For the first time, I felt relief from the depression, anxiety, and the eating disorders. I ate whatever I wanted during my pregnancy, and for the first time, I didn't hate myself. I completely stopped self-harming, even though that had always been my main coping mechanism.

After I gave birth and was able to hold my son for the first time, I felt this extreme euphoria that took over my entire body. I could never describe it to someone who hasn't experienced it, but it felt like the most incredible high as though I had taken the best drug on earth. This lasted for days and days. I couldn't sleep in the hospital because I was so happy. I just stared at my son for hours while he was sleeping. I have never been this happy again since. 

This happiness continued after I brought my son home. I was so focused on him and it became my passion to be his mother. Taking care of him was a full time job, but I loved doing it. I didn't even mind getting up at night with him. My depression and anxiety went away for a long, long time. Only as my son starting growing up, did I start to feel it slowly creeping back in. Now my son is 8 years-old, and the depression has come back full force. It's worse now than it ever was before. I'm constantly thinking about ways to kill myself and I haven't left the house in 2 years. Every single day is a battle just to make myself get out of bed. 

A big part of me wonders if getting pregnant again, and having another baby, would fix me? Just like it did the first time? I want to have another baby so badly because I feel like that's the only thing that will make the depression go away. But I know that it's wrong to have a baby for that reason. I'm not in a stable position in my life financially, either. My husband is totally against having another baby. He doesn't understand that it was the only time in my life when I felt normal and whole.

Women of Reddit, is this a normal thing? I feel crazy coming out and saying this, but I can't be the only one who has experienced this."

My heart is in constant pain. I'M restless, I'M trying to die but failing, what do I do? I seriously dont know what to do?"

I just want to lay in bed all day long. Im trying to  break the pattern but everytime I find myself back in square one. I go out for a walk and seeing people happy with couples and such just make me even sadder and more miserable. I dont know what to do anymore. I am on Luvox double dosage for a week yet I still feel miserable. I honestly am tired. I dont know what to do."
BadCaseOfBrainShakes,2021-08-26 07:44:01+00:00,"I hate being alive. Nothing gets better, nothing gets easier. I don’t know why I’m still here.","I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I fucking hate it. Nothing improves. Nothing gets better. It’s been years. It’s been fucking years. It’s not an “episode” or a “phase” or a “temporary aggravation” it’s fucking permanent now. It’s been fucking years.

CBT? Nothing. DBT? Nothing. EMDR? Nothing. Nothing. FUCKING NOTHING!!!! These fucking therapists are fucking useless. And the pills they give you? Fucking useless too. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, dozens and dozens of the fucking things. Swallowing fucking pills every day and they’re fucking worthless. They do nothing at all. FUCKING NOTHING!! Called a chemist to get more today. Why? Fuck knows. $40. $40 is what they’re asking for them. For fucking sugar pills. Apparently the mood stabilisers “aren’t covered” by my welfare card. Fuck it. Fuck you people and fuck your fucking pills. I’m not paying you. I’m not taking them, don’t care if it’s “dangerous” to stop on the highest dose. Probably more bullshit. Fuck you and fuck off.

The fucking mindfulness, fucking journaling, fucking meditation and motherfucking breathing exercises and the books and whatever else, all fucking lies. Or I’m just biologically fucked. Doesn’t matter either way, same result. 

Nothing good outside my head either. World’s fucked. Can’t have a single fucking solitary freedom without money. And I’m too unstable to hold a job for more than 3-6 months. Get so depressed I start self-harming or think about suicide 24/7, or I get catatonically dissociative, or I just plain go into psychosis. Either way, same story get fired or have to quit. Can’t fucking do it. So guess how much freedom I have? Fucking none.

Wanna go for a drive somewhere? Good fucking luck without a car, asshole. Wanna move away from your toxic mother and her husband? Hahah, fuck you! Wanna get a tattoo to cover your self harm scars? Hope you own your own tattoo gun and don’t mind stick figures, fuckface! Wanna replace all you shit that just keeps breaking? How about I break your nose instead? What about buying some clothes that actually fit or don’t have holes all through em? How about go fuck yourself instead?

And have fun trying to do anything people say you “need” as a human fucking being when you’re this mentally fucked. Try to escape the ceaseless existential boredom that comes with being fucking awake? Not possible for you buddy! Everything bores the fuck outta you! Sorry bout that! Try to escape the crippling loneliness? Haha, don’t be ridiculous, you can’t *connect* to people! What are you fucking nuts? They’re only gonna make you feel more alone, chief! And the second you get around ‘em, you’re just gonna wanna be alone anyway! Cause you’re inherently broken! Enjoy that!

It’s not even like I’ve just given up entirely. I don’t eat shit food. I don’t drink anymore, don’t do drugs. Been sober for 3, almost 4 months. What difference does it make? Fucking none. At all. Haven’t self harmed for 4 months. Does it help? Certainly fucking not! Why try? What’s the fucking point if it makes no fucking difference, huh? Fucking riddle me that one, Batman!

I fucking hate this planet. Hope it fucking explodes. Won’t though. Even the apocalypses on this fucking shithole ball of garbage are completely fucking boring."

Theamazingrealtor,2021-08-26 06:34:16+00:00,Anyone ever escape depression?,I've been really depressed for about 6 months now.. due to recent events within my life it feels like it's getting much worse everyday .. I'm not in a good place right now.  I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice something that I could do right now.. I've tried to find a therapist but it seems my current insurance is not desirable to providers and I'm told that they are not currently accepting new patients... I've tried betterhelp but cannot afford it... I don't have any friends or family to talk to about what's going on ... if I'm being honest it feels like talking to someone about what's going on could really help.. the problem is I don't have anyone.i can't work . I can't eat .. I can't sleep.. I can't even watch my favorite TV show .. before it felt like all I wanted to do was sleep.. but now I can't even do that everything feels like it's in shambles .. I'm not sure what I could do
ArtTheClown23,2021-08-26 06:31:08+00:00,Life feels meh,"Well since I was a kid I’ve been living with the knowledge I’ll be forever alone, it’s a pretty difficult thing to live with. I’m ugly as fuck, short, and a pretty boring individual in general since I am both introverted and shy. I also hate social interaction small talk is meh and boring don’t really care to fake like I care about someone when in reality I don’t. So yea being romantically alone due to all of the above is idk kinda rough at times. Guess I just needed to vent. Also, if anyone reads this I’m not asking for tips I don’t care to change as regardless of whatever I did I’m still short so not attractive off the bat to women so I would have to try harder and be a lot more charismatic and charming and I personally don’t have the energy or see the point in doing any of that for a woman"
feat_gloomyboi,2021-08-26 06:00:18+00:00,feeling so drained.. please help..,"people get home from work and fall right to sleep.. I get home from work and sit in my car for a few hours.. even if I were to lay my head down there is no sleep.. not with melatonin, not with prescription drugs.. and sometimes not even with alcohol or weed..
I lay there tossing and turning, yawning and tears fill my eyes because I’m so tired..
How can I be working and falling asleep at the wheel or go to the gym and fall asleep on the equipment because of lack of sleep but as soon as I go to lay down I can’t sleep for shit and if I do it’s about one hour and I’m wide awake again.. or I get sleep paralysis and I can’t sleep once I’ve gotten out of it.. .. I’m so drained, so exhausted in so many ways that I have to fight cause right now my body is tired of fighting.. it’s like my feet are two feet under grown and I’m dragging them through the earth just to keep “pushing through to the next day” I’m exhausted and have been exhausted in ways I don’t know I’ll ever get back.. I need help but I don’t know how to help myself.. I need help but no one knows what to do for my mental emotional and physical health.. I need help but one size doesn’t fit all.. an when you are one of those people that it doesn’t fit then it’s so hard not to fall..
I’m trying so hard to push through and keep going cause I don’t want to go back.. I hate the feeling of feeling trapped.. but there are many times where the only places I can be is in my car or in the nature on foot or longboard whatever it is because I’m not completely trapped I can drive if I need to and keep going or walk or run.. being in buildings or houses I can’t do it sometimes because I am so trapped.. it don’t matter what it is having 4 walls around me I am trapped and can’t get out.. I am so exhausted.. but I’m trying to keep moving forward even though my body and I are tired and don’t know how much longer we can push through.."

BloopityBlue,2021-08-26 04:11:48+00:00,I'm so tired out - sorry it's so long,"I don't know what it is but I feel like I'm always at odds with people even when I'm just trying to keep my head down and do the right thing. 

My best friend since 2015 has ghosted me because he started dating a woman who decided men and women can't be friends and gave him an ultimatum: her or me. He picked her. He was such an important part of my life (we live 2 time zones away from each other and there was no threat at all from me to their relationship) and now he's just gone without another conversation. I'm gutted. 

I was out to dinner tonight with 4 friends and somehow my one friend accidentally got handed the check and he tried to pay the check. When I saw it was $125 I insisted on paying 1/2. I know my friend much better than the other two know him and I know he lives on a small budget of $400 a month so his picking up the $125 on his own wasn't fair at all and I couldn't let it stand. My other two friends told me I am rude, unnecessary, and that they're ""bigger people"" because they'd let him get the check. I was just trying to do the right thing not laying it all on one person and now I'm on the outs because I insisted on helping. 

I helped a close friend get a job at my company and now he's angry at me because he doesn't like that I'm more senior than him and he is angry that he's not being treated by others as my equal. I have 6 years at this company and he's been there 10 weeks and it's known at my company that it takes a full year to get up to speed because my job is very complicated. I can't help that I know more, but it makes him mad. Now he's not talking to me either. 

I'm just trying to do the right thing, stay down, do my job, do right, and I feel like I'm just always being treated like I'm the one who's the asshole. I'm so exhausted by it all, I don't know how to even deal with this."
EffedUpTrash,2021-08-26 02:46:45+00:00,I thought I was doing a little better.,"I battled bad anxiety and depression for several years. I thought about suicide a few times, but fortunately never felt the real urge to carry it out. Nobody in my life really knows how bad it got, especially the last couple years. I never confided about it to anyone mostly because I am always seen as the tough and “right-minded” person, so I am afraid they won’t believe me.

Things changed recently for the much better. Life started to glow again and I have a lot to look forward to. I was really truly happy for the first time in a long time and while I still am some days other days I’m a broken mess inside. I find myself drifting back to that dark place in my mind despite having no real reason to. And it’s affecting my relationship, which results in me feeling guilty and worse about everything. The person I’m dating is so wonderful and doesn’t deserve a shred of this.

I’m not really looking for advice but really just wanted to get this off my shoulders. As I said I never confided about my depression to anyone so. I can’t really talk to anyone about this now."
DatingMyLeftHand,2021-08-26 02:04:29+00:00,Nobody ever notices that I’m depressed because I have nobody,Nobody would notice me being sullen and withdrawn because nobody ever tries to initiate conversation with me. Nobody would notice if I stopped enjoying things because nobody wants to enjoy things with me. It sucks and I hate being alive so much.
mwade19,2021-08-26 00:48:11+00:00,Can no longer envision my future,"Sometime in the past 3 years, I've no longer been able to imagine what my future could be. It's difficult to explain. 

I had a series of nervous breakdowns over the past 3 years. I had an extremely traumatizing thing happen at my last job and haven't been able to work since. It also affected me in a 1000 more ways. During that time, I also got Lyme disease. I suffer from many food intolerances/allergies. I can eat only a handful of things that won't make me sick. I also had pretty bad gall bladder attack that landed me in the hospital. I also moved to a different country and my 16 yo son at the time (he's now 18) didn't want to move with me and went to live with his father. We are divorced and I remarried - why I moved to a different country. This one thing  probably has been the hardest out of all.

My depression, something I've suffered with off and on over the years, has really been exacerbated from all of this. I have had suicidal thoughts and it's at the point it's on a daily basis. I have been formulating in my head at night when I try to sleep the good-bye letters I'll need to write to my loved ones. 

My spouse has never dealt with depression himself. He has no idea what I go through because I rarely speak to him about it. When I do, he gives me lame advice (I know it's coming from a place of love and good intent). Today, he sent me an article suggesting things for me to do to help with my depression. Everything in that article made depression seem so simplistic. Like, when you're feeling blue, just go for a walk or call a friend. Like I've never thought of that. Thanks a bunch. Again, I know it was meant to help, but he's just so numb about what I go through and exactly what severe depression limits you from doing. I went to a counseling session to try it out, and he asked me if I was all better. Like, really? He really is super unaware and it adds to my depression.

Anyway, my future. I don't see it anymore. Whenever I try to think about it, I instantly just think to myself, 'oh, I won't see that because I'll most likely have finally ended my life before then'. That thought is there ALL THE TIME. 

I know I need help. I just don't know where to start. My mind is always so scrambled up. I equate it to moving to a new home - you never know which box to unpack first."

Major_Lingonberry_57,2021-08-25 23:59:49+00:00,Any advice would be great,"Hi. As I’m a person who’s dealing with my problems alone (i don’t think i should bother others with my problems as others have their own problems and I do not want to bug everyone about this). 
So i did some depression tests and they showed bad results. Have been feeling down for a quite a while with some ups and downs. I can put a mask on and no one around me knows, but i’m really struggling with my thoughts. In general i’ll suck it up and deal with it somehow, but if you could give me any advice for trying to shut my thoughts off, i would really appreciate it.
This is first time I’m asking someone about this.

I had a couple of rough days but my boss didn’t care, I just got in trouble for not working as hard.  Idk sorry for the rant"

I don’t fucking  understand. Suicide is so weak right? Only pussies and spineless people and the most scummy people of the earth endorse in it right?"

I live alone, have no family &amp; no friends anymore, I am alone 99% of my time &amp; it’s really messing me up. I feel like I don’t know how to be around people anymore, anytime I’m out all I want is to go home &amp; hide from everyone.  I’m also on disability right now &amp; not working so I really don’t ever interact with people. I desperately need friends, it’s really difficult to make friends as an adult.  I get really anxious because when you first meet someone they ask a lot of personal questions &amp; when your status’s is unemployed because of my mental health problems,  no friends, no family &amp; am among the loneliest people on earth - it doesn’t exactly make people want to be around you.  I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m in this hole so deep I can’t get out of it alone but I have no one to ask for help…. Anyway that’s my sad depressed rant, needed to vent &amp; have a little pity party, thanks for the outlet"
Brwololo,2021-08-25 17:01:20+00:00,Farewell," 

I was wondering what to write here, even created an account after a few weeks just lurking, but now that I actually am here I feel like nothing I write will be enough. How can I justify the unjustifiable? How can I put death by my own hands into words? I just can't! Yet here I am, doing my best to just express a fraction of my final thoughts.

How do I begin? Do I say I was born in 1994 in a working class family? Or do I skip ahead a few years when my babysitter and local priest molested me at age 8? Or even way later when, a few months ago, my fiancé left me after I lost my job at the university? ""you never smile"" she said. Hell, I don't know! Suffice to say that I am a failed human being! Failed at everything! Failed as a teacher, failed as a friend, son, sibling... There's nothing left to loose but my life, that in itself holds very little value.

Am I a selfish person? Obviously! been selfish all my life, it has always been about MY depression, MY bipolar disorder, MY Ptsd: there was no time to think about other people, I was always too busy surviving each passing day... Its a funny thing to live without wanting to live; you're just a husk of a person... Shallow, empty of emotions, not even sadness, never joy, you just exist, and existing is not enough.

I'm loosing my home... I'm about to become homeless! This is something that's constantly on my mind... How would that first night in the streets feel like?... Sleeping on the curb, no-one paying attention to you, like I am not even there... Will some of them throw nickels at me? Maybe! No... That won't happen to me!

How did I get here? I did everything right! I studied hard, graduated top of my class, had a good job, ate my veggies... Tried to teach people! Tried to educate them on the good path, an honest path. Now what? Did I leave behind anything worthy of note? I guess not! I was a mediocre teacher, mediocre fiancé, mediocre son, mediocre human being who had all the chances in the world and wasted them all! Now I'm here, ready to end it all!

Damn... I don't even recognise myself anymore... It feels like I lost all weight and I am just floating towards the end... I guess this is it... How can I finish such letter? With a message of hope? Of wisdom? I'm not wise! I guess I'll say that:

You need love more than anything, true love! Love heals every wound, love endures! True love is as precious as diamonds! Enjoy your life while you can and be there for each other... Goodbye"

JeremyBearimi,2021-08-25 14:21:59+00:00,Suicidal,I’m feeling suicidal for the first time since my last attempt which was over a year ago. Someone talk to me.
BadCaseOfBrainShakes,2021-08-25 13:48:01+00:00,"I give up trying, I’m fucked and I always will be","I don’t have it in me. I don’t feel like I have anything else to try. This is just me now, I’m accepting it. My mental state is fucked and nothing makes it better. Fine. I’m just gonna suffer then. Can’t do anything about it anyway so why fucking fight it. I just hate being alive and my brain and body physically hurts because of the emotional pain I’m constantly in and that’s just the life I was cursed with.

Therapy does nothing. Medication does nothing. Mindfulness, meditation, “re-framing my thoughts”, journaling, breathing exercises, none of them work on me. I’ve been through the whole fucking gauntlet. I was born to suffer, whatever biology went into making me made sure of it apparently. Cause I’m just immune to any kind of “help”. Fuck it. Drinking doesn’t help. Drugs don’t help. Being sober doesn’t help. Cutting doesn’t help. Not cutting doesn’t help. Nothing makes a fucking difference.

Sober 3 months. Haven’t self harmed for 4. “You should be proud!”. I’m not. I don’t think I can feel pride. I feel nothing. Nothing to be proud of. Easy to stop when you don’t fucking care, when you don’t even have the energy to lift the blade or the bottle, when being drunk or not, bleeding or not is all the fucking same. No pride. Can’t feel pride. Only pain. 

Gonna hear someone say I gotta stop being so negative. Oh yeah? How? Just change my brain? Just stop it from thinking how it thinks? Describe that to me. Cause I don’t understand and I can’t do that.

I don’t even have the energy to kill myself. Wish I did. So I guess I’ll just lay here till I die. Don’t want to eat. Don’t want to drink. Don’t want to breathe. Don’t even have the energy to sleep. Someone is going to say this is temporary but that’s a lie. No one knows that. And it’s been going on for years, so how temporary could it be? 

I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead. I want to be dead.

My brain hurts again now so I’m gonna fuck off."

FrenchOptimusPrime,2021-08-25 12:24:07+00:00,Goodbye,"Weird thing, to be gathering my final words and thoughts before death and giving then to the world so openly on the Internet, to try to find solace in the anonymity and try to justify to the world my coming actions. But I guess here's just as good of a place as any since I no longer have anyone irl that would be interested in reading this words. I hope you will indulge me a few moments of your time to read this.

How do one justify its own suicide? Maybe it cannot be done! Suffice to say that life, the lottery it is, never blessed me with good numbers, as since childhood I've know misery, rape, tragedy and abandonment. But know that, though others have played their part in bringing such problems in my life, Its just a fact that the state I find myself in is just a result of my own bad choices, I have no-one to blame but myself.

Even though my actions may suggest otherwise, I know that I leave behind a loving world, for its the nature of man to love and not to hate, as Chaplin said, only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural, for we have a lot more that unites us than that keeps us apart. We all shared this amazing thing that's called the human experience, and that alone was enough to have made my life worth to be lived again, as sinister the end may be. Know, that in my heart, I leave this world with it full of love for everything that is green and human. I may have know misery, but I also known happiness and joy and that is a miracle itself. 

The coming act is moved by very selfish reasons, and the inability to deal with loss, and grief. I wish it could have ended differently, but its the only way, for life lost its meaning a long time ago and now I exist in a zombie like state, which I wouldn't desire upon my worst enemy. 

I guess all that remains to consider is my legacy. How will I be remembered? Just as my life, my death will be nothing of importance, not even worth of a footnote on anyone's biography, in fact, for many, my passing will be a relief, for I no longer will be a burden on their lives. For I failed as an academic, I failed as a fiancé, I failed as a son, I failed as a friend... You see, my life was nothing but a failure in all fronts, my death should leave behind no better memory of me. 

I say my goodbyes wishing you all all the happiness and love this rich earth can provide. In the end, I held each one of you dear to me and wish you find purpose and kindness. Do not mourn me, for I do not deserve it. 

Sincerely yours"
angelekleo,2021-08-25 11:06:00+00:00,Long time no see,"It's been a long time that didn't post in here. Absolutely doesn't mean that I'm better, I haven't been worse I think, I just do not care enough anymore. I don't hide it anymore I don't care if that make my entourage sad I'm just too tired to try now. I feel bad because I become more and more apathic and selfish in the way I am when I'm with people I won't try to be a good company anymore and I just blame it on being tired if someone ask. And it's not as if anyone saw a change they don't really care too. In fact I think the only person that mention the fact that I was sad was my little brother which I have a really really bad relationship with."
GroundbreakingSpace1,2021-08-25 09:16:09+00:00,I can't believe I have to tolerate/suffer this,"I'm a 34M. My mental state is very fragile and I've been depressed for a very long time. I live with my parents because they would rather I be here than on my own as I get very very unstable when I'm lonely and on my own. I do a lot of chores around the house and occasionally i'm employed off&amp;on for periods as long as I can tolerate. I also help my dad sell things.

But.. my 21F sister also lives here, and that is where the problem starts. She has a boyfriend.. he's here 24/7, he also lives with his parents and they won't hang out at his house because of how conservative they are. This is already kind of difficult for me because I've never had a relationship. They frequently have sex, I never know when morning noon or night..but I'll go to the bathroom and suddenly i'm assaulted with the fact that I can hear EVERYTHING, I don't even want to describe. If I'm aware they are having it I will put in earplugs.. the hilarious irony is that apparently they are into BDSM like a cherry on top to my misery, as I can hear audible smacks through both ear plugs and music. Sometimes I'll already be sleeping and be woken by it, without the protection of my ear plugs. How my parents do not hear or do not seem to care I do not know.

I've complained to my mom so many times. They want my sister to be safe so I'm not allowed to do or say anything. I'm sure many people will say not my house not my rules just move out. But my sister is neurotypical, her boyfriend makes money.. they've been together for over a year.. surely she could move out, or he could move out from his parents, or they could move together.. why wouldn't a young couple want independence.. WHY WHY WHY.. IT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO CHANGE AND THEY WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY BEING AWAY FROM PARENTS, WHILE ITS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME AND WOULD MAKE ME CATASTROPHICALLY DEPRESSED. All I want is to not be triggered by things in the only place where I can feel safe and somewhat mentally sound."
Mostly_upright,2021-08-25 08:01:19+00:00,Depressed wife fed up with my depression,"I've been becoming psychologically lower and lower as the years have progressed. Whenever my wife has a problem with me, I attempt to address it. I never have a problem with her. Being miserable and grumpy isn't seen daily , but the it shows its face about once a week. This is apparently to much for my wife. 
She's been on medication for depression for most of her adult life, whereas I've just started. I'll admit I've been struggling and she has taken alot of the slack, but I can't get out of this slump. I'm trying to change my outlook, I've changed to stronger meds, I'm awaiting therapy. 
I hear her say unexpected things, things that I'd expect someone without depression to say. To snap out of it, just go and see people, talk to people, she can do it why can't I?etc
Nothing is ever her fault l, so when we inevitably have a disagreement it always my fault. It's never hers. Never been in 10 years. How do people attempt to change and improve when every intense convo is list of failings? I then get angry and an inevitable argument ensues and I'm a bad guy.
I'm tired of this."

flippergonzo,2021-08-25 04:12:53+00:00,I just booked a trip to see my brother and sister. It feels like I might be saying my final goodbye then.,"I've been so down for so long. I'm just fucking exhausted. I dont have anything more to give. I'm a 50 year old man and this life is just torture - I didn't sign up for this. I think a lot about suicide. I've written notes and practiced how I will do it, but I've always held off.

I'm travelling to the east coast to visit my brother and sister and their families in October, and it just feels like this trip is at least in part to see them one last time and tell them how much I love them.

Then I just have one more small tattoo I want to get and I think that I'll be ready.

I just wanted to admit the truth to someone, so thanks for listening internet friends!

Peace and love."
