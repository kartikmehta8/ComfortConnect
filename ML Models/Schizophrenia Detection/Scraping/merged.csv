the_true_hennimore	2021-04-30 17:23:49+00:00	The CIA hired two spies to go to the USSR	"The spies all used codenames, the person supplying them with their gear was “X” and the person giving them their orders was “Y”.

Those two were their main contacts from the CIA, they were given little info that the Russians could interrogate them for in the worst case scenario.

And that got the two spies thinking, what if the soviets actually captured them? They’d certainly be subjected to a slow and unpleasant death. They came to the conclusion that the CIA should at least give them cyanide pills to keep in their pockets so they can go painlessly upon being captured.

Shortly before their flight to Soviet Russia, they went to Y to tell him that unless they’re supplied with cyanide pills they will not be taking part in the operation.

Y having already invested a lot of resources into training them had no choice, he told them:

“Don’t go, X gon’ give it to ya!”"

TrumpilyBumpily	2021-04-30 14:29:44+00:00	The scholar and the skeleton (long)	"There once was a town called Pleasantville, and near this town there was a large cemetery on a hill. In that cemetery lay the souls of many generations of villagers. Lately there have been sightings of strange, unexplainable things in the cemetery. The villagers of Pleasantville have grown extremely wary of it and have been avoiding visiting their ancestors to pay respects out of fear of something terrible happening.

One day, a traveling scholar was passing through Pleasantville and was chatting with the villagers at a coffee shop when he heard of this cemetery and the rumors. Being an educated man, he didn't believe in ghost stories, and volunteered to investigate so the villagers could visit their departed loved ones again. 

That night, the scholar entered the cemetery at midnight. The skies were cloudy and the moon was full. For a while he strolled the lanes between the graves, admiring the local tombstone carver's handiwork. 

Suddenly, a bony hand breached the ground several meters away. The scholar watched in quiet awe as a human skeleton climbed out of the ground and approached him menacingly.

The scholar didn't move. The skeleton stopped just a few feet away from the Scholar and gazed at him with what once was his eyes. For a moment, a deathly silence was in the air.

The scholar spoke, ""Pardon me, sir. Why is it that you are unable to rest? Do you intend to attack me? Because you have no muscles with which to raise a weapon.""

The skeleton did nothing. 

""Do you intend to eat me? Because you have no stomach with which to digest food.""

The skeleton did nothing. 

""Or, do you merely intend to frighten me? Because I am a well-learned and traveled man, and I am not easily scared.""

The skeleton broke its silence with a gravelly, uncanny voice. 

""I have returned from the pale darkness of the eternal beyond to say to you...

I'm vegan, I do Crossfit, and how dare you assume my gender?!"""

The barber goes to a drawer and takes out a small wooden ball. He tells the client to place it in his mouth between the cheek and his teeth.  That, the barber explains, will give the man a very smooth shave.

  
Once the barber is done with the shave the man takes the ball out of his mouth and looks in the mirror, happy to see that finally his cheeks are properly shaved.

  
""Say, what would have happened had I swallowed the ball?"" asks the man.

  
""Oh, that wouldn't be a problem, you would do what every other guy does, bring it back the next day!"""

Her overly protective mother looks meaningfully into her daughter's eyes and said, ""Honey, when you go to bed tonight, your boyfriend is going to want to touch your mouth, but you must say no, because your mouth is like cotton, very delicate. Your boyfriend might ask to touch your breasts, but you must say no, because they are your diamonds, precious and they must be kept safe.""

After checking to see that her daughter is paying attention she continues, "" And at all costs, keep him away from your vagina, because that's a grill, and anything that goes into your fire will burn."" So saying, she sends off the daughter and calls her up the next day to ask how it went.

""Oh mom!"" says the daugher, ""I told him everything you said, and he said he understood it all.""

""That's wonderful, darling! That means he didn't touch you anywhere!"" says the overjoyed mother.

""Oh no mom, he told me had a nugget he wanted to fry on my grill, and every so often he'd take it out so I could taste if it was done."" replied the daughter."

PurpleFunk36	2021-04-30 09:45:17+00:00	The Devil was sitting in Hell one fine morning...	"He was busy chuckling as he watched a rerun of World War 2 on TV, when suddenly a man appeared in a burst of flames. The man was covered from head-to-toe in blood and scorch marks. 

The Devil looked at his paperwork and frowned. He didn’t seem to have a file for the man. 

“Epstein!” The Devil roared, turning to a figure in the distance, “Stop swinging on that rope and get my paperwork in order. This is the second time this week!”

“It doesn’t matter,” the man said, his eyes wide in shock, “It’s the end of the world. You wouldn’t believe what I’ve witnessed.”

“The end of the world?” The Devil asked, looking confused, “That’s odd, God wasn’t planning Armageddon until next Tuesday. He must have brought it forward. How interesting!”

The Devil looked at the man with curiosity, “Well, why don’t you tell me what you remember before you died.”

The man sighed, 

“Well, it all started when I went to visit an old friend. He had just moved into a new place. It feels like a dream now it’s over. 

I was moving through the entrance to the complex when I heard it. A low gargling noise, and dragging footsteps. The sound was truly terrifying. 

I looked to my right. And that’s when I saw it.”

“Saw what?!” The Devil asked curiously. 
 
“A zombie.”

The Devil jumped with excitement. 

“Alright,” The Devil called, turning to his minions, “Who bet God would use zombies for the Apocalypse?”

The man continued, “He was moving towards me slowly, eyes bloodshot, mouth open. His arms were raised for my throat. He didn’t even look human anymore. 

I realised in that moment that it was kill or be killed. My mind clicked into gear. This is what all those years of planning for a zombie apocalypse had paid off for. 

I pulled my trusty sidearm from my pants and let fire. Headshot of course. It’s the only way. 

Well shit went crazy then. 

Bodies started coming out of everywhere. Doors flung open and zombies began dragging themselves out. Some were crawling on the floor, some with horrific sores on their faces, others with a missing limb or too. 

All of them had the same dead look in their eyes.

I can’t tell you how many I took out. I was like Rick Grimes on drugs. Do you like zombie shows?”

“Oh yes.” The Devil nodded, “We’ve got Netflix down here, but we use Heaven’s account. It’s a victimless crime really. Like treason”

The man continued, “I came across one human who had a zombie with both arms over her shoulders. I took them both out. You can’t doubt yourself in those situations.

An alarm sounded across the complex, and I realised that I was done. I knew it was time. I pulled out a grenade from my satchel.  You always need one for an emergency.  I pulled the pin, held it, and charged at the enemy.

Next thing I know, I’m here.”

“What a story!” the Devil exclaimed, shooing away Joseph Stalin who had come to listen. 

“But we have a problem.” The Devil continued. “Let me consult my ‘Grey Area’ compendium. I’m quite sure killing zombies falls into a grey area. You know, defending your life against the undead and all.”

The Devil pulled out a book from nowhere, and flicked through the pages,

“Hmmm....Karens.....Reposters...ah! Here we are. Yes....yes I’m afraid that there’s been a mistake in your processing.” The Devil said cheerfully, “You get to go to heaven!”

The man clapped in excitement.

“Let me just make a quick call,” The Devil said, pulling a phone out of nowhere, and dialling a number. 

“Hey Jesus my man. It’s your boy Devil,” The Devil said, “I’ve got another person here that’s yours.”

An angry voice sounded on the other end of the phone. 

The Devil paused and then nodded, before hanging up the phone. 

“What’s the matter?” The man asked. 

“He said to call back in twenty minutes.” The Devil explained, “He’s got 50 people that just arrived from a retirement village.”"

SigumndFreud	2021-04-30 03:40:10+00:00	An old Georgian toast...	"A little bird was flying to her nest through an ice storm. Her wings got wet and heavy eventually she could no longer flap them, exhausted she fell onto a frozen ground after a few tries to fly she gave up and was about to freeze from the cold when a passing cow dropped a cow pie right on top of her. At first the bird struggled but it was warm and she made it through the night in the morning it got warmer and some warms crawled up to the cow pie and the little bird had a meal. In fact she was so happy she survived and so ready for the new day she started to chirp. A cat was walking by, heard the bird, pounced and killed it. 

The moral of this anecdote is that not everyone that gives you shit is you enemy and not everyone that pulls you out of shit is your friend. And finally if you are sitting there neck deep in shit don’t chirp about it to anyone who would listen"

The Marine has his dog with him. It's a German Shepherd, and it bristles at the ugly little yellow dog.

The Marine says ""Son, you need to get your ugly little yellow dog out of here, or my dog is going to eat your dog.""

The little guy looks up at the Marine and says ""Well, my dog may be little, and he may be ugly, and he may be yellow, but I'm not worried about him. he can take care of himself.""

The Marine bursts out laughing, reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a hundred-dollar bill. He slams it down on the bar and says "" I got a hundred dollars that says my dog is gonna kill your dog.""

The little guy starts fishing around in his pockets, comes up with twenty dollars here, ten dollars there, has to borrow five dollars from the guy on the other side of him, but finally comes up with $100. 

""Okay, you have a bet.""

The Marine takes his German Shepherd off its choke chain. The little guy reaches down and takes the string off the ugly little yellow dog's collar.

All hell breaks loose. Chairs are flying, people are screaming, the bartender dives down behind the bar to get out of the way, and the last thing anybody sees, before the dust closes in and obscures all vision, is that German Shepherd, running like hell, trying to get away from the ugly little yellow dog.

The Marine picks himself up off the floor, wipes blood off of his face, and says ""Damn, kid, that's one mean little ugly little yellow dog! What the hell kind of dog is that?""

""Well, before I cut off his tail and painted him yellow, he was an alligator."""

Nevertheless, he said he saw my potential and picked me. 

The board was going to met today to discuss about an impending merger. My boss asked me to come, to get my feet wet on making big decisions about the company. I can’t help but feel optimistic, a promotion and a salary increase would really help right now. 

He offered to give me a ride home after the meeting so we can talk about what went on. I remembered our first interview, that I lingered before I answered any of his questions. So when he asked me what was my take away from the meeting, I answered straight away, “the roast beef, sir”."

So, in 1832, an American who had moved to Ontario had been hunting wild game.

Now, he hadn't bothered with the paper work for a license, as he thought it was remote enough that no one would bother.

After getting repeated warnings to stop, he was finally arrested when he shot and killed a Brown Bear and was caught stuffing it.

There was all that usual singing and dancing with horns blowing and drums Dum-ba-badumping. Suddenly, a a very strange thing captured the poOr guy's attention. He felt as if a miracle was going to happen to save his life: He noticed a guy in the cannibals' community, who looked all like the others but was Dum-ba-badumping in a very familiar way, very different from the others' style. Yes! he was Dum-ba-badumping in the very unique Armenian way that no member of any other ethnicity could do. This was his way out for sure.

camsnow77	2021-04-29 18:06:18+00:00	Stimulate Canada	"Sometime this year, we taxpayers will likely again receive another 'Economic Stimulus' payment.

 
This is indeed a very exciting program, and I'll explain it by using a Q &amp; A format:

 

Q. What is an 'Economic Stimulus' payment ?

 
A. It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers.

 

Q.Where will the government get this money ?

 
A. From taxpayers.

 

Q. So the government is giving me back my own money ?

 
A. Yes but only a smidgen of it.

 

Q. What is the purpose of this payment ?

 
A. The plan is for you to use the money to purchase a ;high-definition TV set, thus stimulating the economy.       

 

Q. But isn't that stimulating the economy of China ?

 
A. That is correct

 

Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the Canadian economy by spending your stimulus check wisely:

 

* If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart or Costco, the money will go to China or Sri Lanka .      

 

* If you spend it on gasoline, your money could go to the Arabs.

 

* If you purchase a computer, it will go to India , Taiwan or ;China ...           

 

* If you purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to Mexico , Honduras and Guatemala ...

 
* If you buy an efficient car, it will go to Japan or Korea .

 
* If you purchase useless stuff, it will go to Taiwan .

 
* If you pay your credit cards off, or buy stock, it will go   ;   to management bonuses and they will hide it offshore.

 
Instead, keep the money in Canada by:

 
1) Spending it at yard sales, or

 
2) Going to hockey games, or

 
3) Spending it on prostitutes, or

 
4) Beer or

 
5) Tattoos.

 
(These are the only real Canadian businesses still operating  )

 
Conclusion:

 
Go to a hockey game with a tattooed prostitute that you met at a yard sale and drink beer all day!"

The husband gets annoyed, finds a branch in the road, looks at the donkey and says, “That’s once.” Then proceeds to smack him in the forehead. The donkey gets startled and starts moving again.

Not even a 15 minutes go by and the donkey stops again. Not moving. The husband getting even more agitated, grabs another branch and says to the donkey, “That’s twice.” Whack, again to the forehead. He shakes it off and starts moving.

Another 15 minutes go by and the donkey stops again. This time the husband gets angrily off the carriage, pulls out a gun and says, “That’s three,” and shoots the donkey dead. He puts the gun away and climbs back in.

The bride goes crazy, starts screaming, “We have 5 more miles and you killed the donkey. What are we supposed to do?!”

Mr_Big_Judda	2021-04-29 02:59:48+00:00	Old man and the IRS	"There was this old man in his 80's, that got a letter from the IRS telling him to contact them immediately. 

He calls and the IRS agent and is told he needs to come to his office regarding some irregularities with his account. 

The old man thought about it and decided he should bring his Lawyer along with him just in case. 

When they get to the office, the IRS agent pulls up the old man's file and questioned him about large sums of money going in and out of his account at irregular intervals. 

The agent stated that he needs an explination for these large sums or they would have to perform a full audit. 

The old man confesses and says that he enjoys betting from time to time. He says that he only bets substantial amounts, otherwise it's not worth betting. And he will bet on absolutely anything. 

The IRS agent, out of curiosity and needing something for his report, tells the old man to explain. 

The old man says ""alright, I bet you $5,000 I can bite my own eye."" 

Agent doesn't see how thats possible, so he agreed and the old man took out his glass eye, bit it, and put it back in. 

This perturbed the agent but a bet was a bet, and it was made in front of a lawyer. 

Not wanting to upset the IRS agent too much, the old man said ""I don't want you to get in trouble, seeing how you're an IRS agent and all. I'll let you try to earn your money back plus a little. I bet you $7,500 that I can bite my other eye"" 

Seeing that the old man didn't come in with a seeing-eye-dog, a cane, or with any other assistance, he didn't see how the old man could pull this off. So he agreed. 

The old man proceeded to pull out his teeth and bite is other eye with them. 

Now this really got the agent upset. The old man tried to appeal to him again. 

He told the agent ""I will bet you $10,000, that if you place a bucket in the corner of your office, that i can pee into that bucket from the other side of the room, and not get a single drop outside of the bucket. I tell you what since you are already $12,500 in the hole, I'll make it $15,000."" 

The agent thought there was no way possible for him to accomplish this, so he said 'you're on!"" 

The old man then proceeds to pee all over the office and not even get close to the bucket. 

The IRS agent jumps up in excitement because he won the bet. 

Even though the old man lost the bet and now owed the agent $2,500, he was pretty happy about it, but the lawyer started getting very agitated. 

The IRS agent asked why the lawyer was so upset. The old man proclaimed ""I bet him $100,000 that I could piss all over your office and that you would be happy that I was doing it!"""

She asked me to pick her up, so i did, but I wasn't expecting much. I went up to the door expecting 400 lbs of desperation, but she answer the door 5 foot 2 with baby blue eyes, strawberry blonde curls and all the right curves in all the right places. I said WOW and gave her my name. She gave me hers, so i asked what she did. 

She said ""I'm a Sunday school teacher."" 

I said ""Well, I Ain't never been with a Christian woman before but I'm open minded about the whole affair.""

So we got in my Corvette and i was trying to impress her now. I headed to the fancyest place in town that didn't take reservations. I asked her if she'd  like to smoke a joint while we wait. 

She said ""Heavens no! What would i tell my sunday school children?"" And I apologized.

I figure weed's 50/50 some people do some people don't,  so i took a few puffs and then we got a table. 

She ordered the lobster, I ordered the steak. I asked for the 2nd most expensive bottle of wine on the list, but when our waiter came to pour it, she declined saying ""Heavens no! What would I tell my Sunday school children?""

I knew right then and there it was a bust. We ate our pricey meals. We talked and laughed. Had a great time at dinnet bur I drank that whole pricey bottle by myself thinking her Christ was one helluva cock blocker. 

So I'm driving her home and we pass a cheap motel. I figure I've got nothing left to lose,  so I say ""Why don't we get a room and fuck like bunnies?""

She says ""I thought you'd never ask!""

I say ""really? What will you tell your Sunday school children?""

She says, ""The same thing I tell them every week...

YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRINK AND SMOKE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME!!!""

So, this guy has been traveling down this old dirt road for hours. He's tired and thirsty, but there's been nothing around. Eventually, he comes across a billboard, next to a small building, that says, ""Granny's Whorehouse"". He thinks, ""Maybe I can get a few drinks and a place to rest."" He goes in and, behind what appears to be a hotel front desk is a woman who appears to be in her late 80s/early 90s.

Old Lady: Welcome to Granny's Whore House. I'm Granny. Fifty bucks and you get what you get.

Guy: Hi. I'm just looking for a few drinks and a place to rest.

Granny: Fifty bucks and you get what you get.

Guy: Fine. 

He gives her $50.

Granny: Upstairs, door at the end of the hall.

So the guy goes upstairs and goes through the door at the end of the hall. It's at this point that he realizes, there is no room behind the door, and he falls to the ground behind the building. As he's picking himself up, he sees the back of the billboard.

Back of Billboard: Congratulations! You just got screwed by Granny!"

She made a mistake, however, when she accused Frank, a new member, of being an alcoholic after she saw his old pickup parked in front of the town's only bar one afternoon.   She emphatically told Frank (and several others) that everyone seeing it there would know what he was doing!

Frank, a man of few words, stared at her for a moment and just turned and walked away.  He didn't explain, defend, or deny.   He said nothing.

Later that evening, Frank quietly parked his pickup in front of Mildred's house ... walked home ... and left it there all night."

'Father.""

The second woman replies even more proudly, ""My son is a bishop, when he walks into a room people call him 'My Grace.""

The third woman thinking she wins replies, ""My son is a Cardinal! When he walks into a room people say, 'My Eminence.""

The fourth woman says nothing but sips her tea quietly.

The three women stare at her and then ask her what is so special about her son.

With a smug look on her face she replies, ""My son is a 6' 5"" muscular man, with a chiseled jaw and arms as big as pipes. And when he walks into a room all the woman say, 'Oh My God."""

   The first flea, curious, asks the second flea what his problems were? 
   The second flea replies “I’ve hopped from the Midwest all the way to Florida, I’m absolutely worn out!”
   The first flea says “you’re doing it all wrong!” 
“Do what I do... find a really hot, blonde woman that is coming to the beach, crawl up her leg and bury yourself into her soft, golden pubes!”
   The second flea agrees that this is a great idea and goes on his way. 

   One year later, the first flea is lying on the beach, getting some sun and relaxation when he sees the same flea from last year approaching. 
Once again, the second flea is ragged, worn out looking and seems very exhausted. 

   The first flea asks the second flea “did you forget what I told you to do last year???”

The second flea replies “I did everything you suggested!” “I found the hottest blonde woman I could find that was talking about going to the beach, so I crawled up her leg and buried myself into her soft, golden pubes and took a very relaxing nap”

   The first flea asks “then explain yourself, why do you look like such crap?”

   Second flea replies “when I woke up, I was stuck in some bikers mustache, flying down the highway and I’ve been holding on for dear life!”"

During his first day of work, the town preacher stops by to bless the man's work, saying, ""May you and God work together to make this the farm of your dreams!"" A few months later, the preacher stops by again to call on the farmer. Lo and behold, it's like a completely different place--the farm house is completely rebuilt and in excellent condition, there is plenty of cattle and other livestock happily munching on feed in well-fenced pens, and the fields are filled with crops planted in neat rows. 

""Amazing!"" the preacher says. ""Look what God and you have accomplished together!"" 

""Yes, reverend,"" says the farmer, ""but remember what the farm was like when God was working it alone!"""

These three cowboys were traveling south and finally crossed the border from Oklahoma into a new territory that was still owned by Mexico. As they sat down to make camp that night one of them looked around as the sun set over the horizon and asked his companions ""what should we name this place? I am not sure what the locals call it but it has not been given a name by us settlers."" One of the other cowboys looks around and crinkles his nose and then turned towards the cowboy who had spoken and said, with a sideways glance at their other companion, ""well, it certainly smells like Tex's ass after he has eaten beans for dinner."" The other cowboy laughs and gazes out past their campfire at all the scraggly brush dotting the hills and then looks at the dry dirt at his feet and says ""yeah, and it kinda looks like Tex's ass too. Lets call this place ""Tex's Ass."" And the name stuck, although over the years it has been shortened to the easier to say ""Texas."" Though it still looks and smells as much like Tex's ass as it did the day it got the name."

straycanoe	2021-04-28 15:01:15+00:00	A man went to the doctor to inquire about options for penis enlargement...	"""Doc,"" he said, ""you've got to help me. My penis is miniscule. It always has been. The other boys used to make fun of me in the locker room, girls I dated would laugh at me as soon as we got to the bedroom... I experienced nothing but humiliation my whole life, until I met my wife, god bless her. She loves me for who I am and says it doesn't matter that I have a micropenis because we can have fun in other ways, and we do, but I just wish I could satisfy her in the way a man truly should, with a good old-fashioned pounding.""

""Well,"" said the doctor, ""I can understand your situation entirely. It's more common than you think. The thing is, the drugs that are available to treat this kind of condition won't make much of a difference in size if you're starting with a penis as extremely tiny as yours. The standard surgical options have much the same problem: you simply don't have enough tissue to work with.""

The man hung his head in despair, his eyes filled with tears.

""However,"" continued the doctor, ""There is a secret experimental project, which I happen to be a part of, to develop a procedure that will help men with precisely the problem you have. If you're willing to sign a waiver and non-disclosure agreement, I can sign you up as a test subject.""

The man looked up excitedly. ""I'll sign whatever you want! What does the procedure involve?""

The doctor stared at him gravely. ""It's quite risky, and somewhat ethically questionable due to the sourcing of the donor material.""

""Tell me! Tell me!"" said man, quivering with anticipation.

""We,"" said the doctor, ""will graft the muscles from the trunk of an elephant to your penis. Not only will you be long and girthy, but you will also become so dexterous as to make you the greatest lover the world has ever known.""

No discussion was needed. The man phoned his wife to tell her the news and immediately went to be prepped for surgery.

After a long recovery, he returned home. His wife was very pleased to see him and had a beautiful dinner laid out at the table to celebrate the occasion. They sat down to their feast.

""Well,"" his wife asked, a big grin on her face, ""was the procedure a success?""

Without saying a word, the man folded his arms as his penis reached up, snake-like, grasped a dinner roll, and disappeared beneath the table.

Staggered, amazed, and astounded, his wife said, ""That's incredible! I can't believe it! Can you do that again?!""

""Probably,"" replied the man, uncomfortably, ""but I don't think I can fit another bun up my ass."""
Hannibal_Lecture	2021-04-28 14:57:24+00:00	Sorting out my shit for me! [Long]	"Moe owns a bar, and he has been finding it really hard to manage the bar and take care of his personal life. Things are just piling up and getting on top of him. Recently his Aunt got divorced and so she has been sitting at the end of the bar drinking away his profits, his Rottweiler Chomper has just bust a tooth chewing on a rock, and the door to the toilet is off its hinges. 

Rather than sort these issues out himself, he decides to challenge one of the regulars to sort it out for him. To sweeten the deal he decides offer some free dutch courage.

Moe ""Hey Jack, Can I make you a deal? I'll give you a free pint of what ever you want, and a £100, if you do three things for me""
Jack looks up, and senses the risk ""I ain't doing shit for you Moe""

However as the night progresses, Moe keeps piling Jack with booze, and eventually the deal is agreed!


Jack ""Fuck it Moe, let's hear what you want""
Moe ""OK, so the first thing I want you to do, is fix the toilet door, the tools are over there. The second thing I want you to do is take the pliers and pull out old Chompers bad tooth, he's out the back, and finally, Old Agnus up the end of the bar, I want you to take her home and fuck her silly, make her forget her old man""

Jack takes a moment, then remembers the free drink ""I'll have a pint of Vodka!"" he shouts.

Moe pours the vodka, and Jack stands at the bar, and then just necks the whole lot. He falls flat on his face and passes out. Moe is just starting to get annoyed when Jack jumps back to his feet and runs to the toolbox. The door is back on its hinges in under 10 minutes. Everyone in the bar is watching now as they have never seen anything like it. Jack is clutching the pliers as he runs out the back door. 

The barking starts. Then there is screaming. Then more barking and growling. Then more blood curdling screaming. Then silence.... People are looking at each other wondering whats happened, is he dead?! Then all of a sudden they see Jack crawling back through the door, his clothes ripped, blood and wounds over his body and face. He is a mess. He manages to heave himself up to the bar, drops the pliers on the bar, leans over to Joe and says: 

""Right, so.... wheres the old bitch with the bad tooth?"""

""Alright, son, this is one thing that will help you become a man. It's a privilege we have that women do not, so it's important to take advantage of it. All you have to do is follow these nine steps.""

The boy listens intently and follows each direction:

""Step one: unzip your trousers.""

""Okay.""

""Step two: pull out your penis.""

""Got it.""

""Step three: pull back your foreskin. This will help you aim better.""

""Oh, I see.""

""Step four: go pee, making sure to squeeze out every drop.""

*grunts ""*Easy enough.""

""Step five: push your foreskin back into place.""

""Right.""

""Step six: tuck your penis back inside your underwear.""

""Yeah.""

""Step seven: zip up your trousers.""

""Uh huh.""

""Step eight: flush the toilet.""

""Well of course, dad.""

""Step nine: wash your hands. Your mom will raise hell if you skip this one.""

""Oh, okay.""

""And that's it! Now one last thing that your grandpa told me when he taught me all this at your age: saying the number of each step out loud will help you remember to do them in the right order and save you from making a mess.""

""Thanks dad! I feel like a real man now!""

""That's my boy.""

A few days later, the boy is in the bathroom, and his father happens to walk past the closed door. Wondering whether the boy has been practicing what he had taught him, the dad pauses to listen, but all he hears is:

He unwrapped the plain hamburger and carefully cut it in half, placing the other half in front of his wife. He then carefully counted out the French fries, dividing them into two piles, and neatly placed one pile in front of his wife. He took a sip of the drink, then his wife took a sip, and then he set the cup down between them. 

As he began to eat his few bites of hamburger, the people around them were looking over and whispering. Obviously, they were thinking , 'That poor old couple - all they can afford is one meal for the two of them.'

As the man began to eat his fries, a young man came to the table and politely offered to buy another meal for the old couple. The old man said they were just fine - ""We're used to sharing everything"".

People closer to the table noticed that the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite. She just sat there, watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink. 

Again, the young man came over and begged them to let him buy another meal for them. This time, the old woman said ""No, thank you, we are used to sharing everything"".

Finally, as the old man finished and was wiping his face neatly with the napkin, the young man came over again to the little old lady, who had yet to eat a single bite of food, and asked, ""What exactly is it that you are waiting for?"" 

She answered, ""THE TEETH""!"

XLratedr	2021-04-28 11:11:06+00:00	An old paratrooper joke	"the original one (at least the one that I know) is in Hebrew.
The son is joining the army and his father wants him to become a  paratrooper just like he did. 
He is not in fit and he is afraid of heights, but his father told him that if he won't become one, he won't be allowed to enter his house again.
the son begins his basic training and comes home after 1 month.
the son tells his dad about how the army is, and all the father care is if he did the great first plane jump.
the son starts to tell his dad about it.
""well they took 50 of us, gave us our gear and we took the plane, on our way our commander explained everything again, just in case someone didn't understand.
once we arrived our destination the commander told us to jump.30 of us jumped first""
""did you jump?"" ask the father in excitement.
""well no, I was afraid.
next the commander told the 20 of us to jump. if not we will stay another week in the base for duty, 15 jumped""
""You jumped right? that's why you are here now"" said the father.
""Umm. no, I stayed week, the rest of the department came home week ago.
the commander was pissed that 5 didn't jump and said that if someone won't jump now he is going to fuck him in the ass untill he passes out""
the father looked at his son and said ""you jumped right?""
the son said ""Yes, a bit at the start."""

Unsure, the child asks ""What does that mean?""  
""Go and ask your father. He's in the garage."" replies the mother.  
The little girl goes and finds her father and says ""Mom won't let me take the dog for a walk because she is on heat. What does that mean?""  
Not wanting to discuss it, the father grabs a rag, soaks it in petrol and scrubs the dogs rear end with it; disguising the scent.  
Happy with his solution, he turns to his daughter and says ""You can walk the dog now but keep a tight hold on the leash and only go around the block once.""  
After a short while, the little girl returns without the dog.  
Surprised, the father asks the little girl ""Where's the dog?""  
""She ran out of petrol halfway around the block"" replies the little girl ""But don't worry, another dog is giving her a push home"""

TombStoneFaro	2021-04-27 10:11:50+00:00	Jokes from different cultures/languages	"Years ago (like 1980) a guy from Russia brought in a joke book which had illustrated jokes from Russia/USSR and I was struck by how unfunny they were. One theme was cannibalism which I guess stemmed from WW2 sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad; I understood the jokes but was not amused.

Then, in maybe 1995 there was an international joke competition. There was the funniest joke in the world as well as what people liked in different countries. Amazed at what people thought was funny in Belgium, etc. (The winning joke I think was the Sherlock Holmes/Watson tent joke and I think the top usa joke was a hunter accidentally shoots his partner and when the 911 operator says, wait -- let's be sure he's dead, the hunter shoots him again. I did not like either joke. The Holmes joke because it involved fictional characters and the hunter joke because no 911 dispatcher would say something like that.)

I understand that Chinese jokes do not translate into English very well and knowing many native speakers of Chinese, I have noticed a very different sense of humor. I am not surprised: different culture, older humor tradition and of course a very different language.

At the same time, I can think of some jokes that should work in almost any language.

What has been your experience with humor from different cultures?"

Chieftain: ""Today my wife gave birth to a white child. She and I are dark skinned. You are white. It doesn't take a doctor to figure out that you have slept with my wife!""

The doctor remains calm: ""The answer lies in the genetics. Some genetics have recessive traits, which are not apparent to the parents but may be passed on to the child. For example, last week one of your sheep gave birth to a black sheep.""

The chieftain pauses for a thinking, then replies: ""I tell you what. You say no word about black sheep and I say no word about white child."""

Startherecca	2021-04-27 08:39:33+00:00	"A horse, a dog and a chicken are living in a farmhouse of a wealthy farmer."	"One day, the dog and the chicken are playing in a meadow. The chicken being young &amp; playful is running all around with the dog chasing her. But suddenly the chicken falls into a mud hole and is sinking. She calls to the dog to go and get the farmer to help pull her out to safety. The dog runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's BMW back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to the chicken who grasps it, and drives the car forward saving her from sinking! 

A few days later, the chicken and horse are playing in the meadow and the chicken falls into the mud hole again. The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. But the horse said, ""I think I can stand over the hole!"" So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, ""Grab my penis and pull yourself up."" So the chicken did and pulled herself to safety.                                                

Moral of the Story: If you're hung like a horse, you don't need a BMW to pick up chicks."

""D-d-d-d-docter I have a really bad s-s-s-stutter caused by all the b-b-b-b-blood going to my huge p-p-p-p-penis""

The doctor takes a look and can see that is the case. They come to an agreement that the man must have his penis reduced to a normal size to help with blood flow and stop the stutter.

A week later and the doctor conducts the surgery and removes most of the penis and leaves it off to the side and stitches the man up. He wakes up and without a doubt, no stutter! ""Thank you doctor this will be life changing!""

A week passes and the man comes back down to see the doctor. ""Doctor iv been able to talk fine but the issue is the girls don't like me anymore, I used to get all the ladies with my huge penis, now they don't like me, I need you stitch my penis back on""

The doctor replies, ""g-g-g-g-go fuck yourself"""

Husband: Honey did you know that the wifi is not working?

Wife: Yes! It is so weird it hasn't been working like all day. I don't know why but I had to do this webinar class on hotspot. 

Husband: how long was the webinar class?

Wife: 4 hours.

Husband: 4 hours?! We don't have unlimited data!  Did you try to reset the internet? Or just turning it on and off or anything??

Wife: No. I didn't have time to go upstairs.

Husband: The internet is in the basement.

Wife.: Oh well see I couldn't fix it because I didn't know where it is.

Husband: Well where did you take the class?

Wife: in the basement.

Husband: Did you notice of the lights were on the internet box?

Wife: I don't even know where it is!


Since the wife was clearly getting upset, the husband decided to go downstairs and see what was wrong. He noticed that the internet is off but the router was on. At first glance he thought  think that maybe the power wire has gone bad on the modem itself.

He went to check the plugs and notice that his wife's laptop was also plugged into the power strip which was previously full of various things like the router, the desktop, monitor, speakers, and .... Now a laptop. 

The husband went back up to his wife.

Husband: I think I found the problem!

Wife: oh thank God what was wrong?

Husband: there was a laptop plugged into the power strip.

Wife: Does that stop the internet from working?

Husband: it does when you unplug the internet to plug in the laptop."

AntarcticanJam	2021-04-26 20:39:33+00:00	Two guys in the old west are walking around and come across a big hole.	"Out in the old west, two guys are out for a walk when they come across a big hole in the ground. The hole is 20 feet across, and they can't see the bottom. To figure out how deep the hole is, they decide to throw some pebbles and listen for when they hit the bottom.
They listened and listened, for about 30 seconds but heard nothing. So they grabbed some bigger rocks and eventually a boulder. But no matter what they dropped in the hole they couldn't hear anything to suggest how deep it was.

""Hey, I saw an old train car down by the tracks, just abandoned in the bushes"" said one of the men. ""Think we can push it over here? That'll certainly make enough noise that we can finally tell how deep this hole is."" 

So they walked about 1/4 mile back, uncovered the old train car, and used all their strength rolling it back to the hole. When they finally got there, they pushed the train car into the hole, and it dropped away. But to their surprise, there was still no noise. 

As they thought about what to do next, they heard a noise and turned around to see a horse, running at them in full sprint, faster than any horse they'd ever seen before. Just as the horse was about to knock them over, they dove in opposite directions to avoid being run over. Both men looked up just in time to see the horse dive head-first into the hole and disappear completely (still no noise from the bottom). Astonished, the men began discussing possibilities. Is it supernatural? Is it bottomless? 

Then they were interrupted by a cowboy stepping out of the brush. ""What're you fellas doin?"" he inquired. The men explained how they'd been out walking in the area, enjoying the day, then they found this hole.

""Wow, cool!"" said the cowboy. ""Did you happen yo meet my horse while you were out walking around? You'd love him!""

Nervously, the guys try to explain they'd just seen: a horse had just run full speed and dove into the magic hole, which seems to be bottomless.... ""Really hope that wasn't your horse, sir,"" one said.

""Naw couldn't have been my horse,"" said the cowboy ""I have him tied to an old railway car about 1/4 mile back."""

lyricmeowmeow	2021-04-26 20:26:44+00:00	This morning someone left a message on our community bulletin board.	"It read: “Hi we’re in 4B. Our son has been behaving awfully bad lately. Missing his homework and lying to us constantly. We plan on reprimanding him the old-fashion way after school today. We apologize in advance for any noises &amp; commotion that may occur. We’ll make it quick. Thank you all for understanding.”

By the time I got home from work, there were more notes posting next to the original one from 4B. 

One said, “What time are you guys doing it? We’ve been wanting to do that for a while now! Let’s sync up the time so we can get it over with together tonight!”

The other note expressed, “Can you start an online private group, that way we can trade stories and tactics, please?”

And another wrote, “Can you livestream it? We want to show our daughter what would happen to her if she doesn’t behave!”

The last note went, “OMG my husband and I have been wanting to do that last week but grandma was here! Now that grandma has gone back home, let’s all do it together tonight!”"

My_Balls_Itch_123	2021-04-26 20:18:33+00:00	A poor Irish family	"A poor Irish family lives on a farm and they rely on their single cow for income.

One morning, the father walks outside to find their cow dead.

""There is nothing that could help get us out of poverty now,"" says the dad as he shoots himself.

The mom walks outside and sees the dad and the cow on the ground.

""I can't live without my husband,"" she says as she shoots herself with her husband's gun.

The daughter walks outside and sees her mother, father and cow dead.

""I can't live any longer without my family,"" she says as she jumps into the river and kills herself.

The oldest son, 23 years old, walks outside looking for the family and sees them all dead.

""Is there anyway to bring them back,"" he yells at the sky.

Poof! A female leprechaun appears.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The boy fucks her 3 times in a row and he dies.

The middle son, 19 years old, comes out and sees the leprechaun. She gives him the same offer as his brother.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The son agrees to do it but can only do it 4 times. He dies.

The youngest son, 15 years old, comes out and is given the same offer.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The son says, ""What if I fuck you 10 times in a row?""

The leprechaun thinks. She says, ""I will bring back your family and give you my pot of gold.

The son says, ""Wait, how do I know you will survive it?""

""What do you mean?"" says the leprechaun.

""The cow didn't."""

""What did you have for breakfast on the eighth of January 1993?""

He says ""Eggs""

So 5 years later I'm moving away from California to another job and I stop with my U-Haul at the same place and I walk up to the guy again and I decide to do the traditional native American greeting I up up my hand and say ""How""

The driver agrees: ""You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.""
 

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :

Cycling is a danger to the country

Now reasons: 

• He doesn't buy cars

• He doesn't take loans

• He does not insure the car

• He doesn't buy fuel

• He does not pay for car servicing

• He doesn't pay for car parking

• Moreover, he is not fat and healthy

So, yes, it can be concluded that a healthy person is not good for the economy of the country, because: - 

• He doesn't buy medicine

• He does not go to the hospital or to the doctor

• He does not make any significant contribution to the country's GDP through any significant expenses previously mentioned

Now in contrast, the man who runs a fast food shop apart from the employees is also creating another 30 jobs in the country.

How? 

• 10 Heart Physicians

• 10 dentists

• 10 weight loss dietitians / doctors / trainers.  

However, what makes an economy actually sick are those who travel on foot, because they do not even buy that fucking bicycle."

Intrigued, he decides that he wants to learn how to play so he phones the local music teacher asking for lessons. He says “I’d like to learn how to play the piano but there’s one problem. I’m a horse.” The music teacher responds quickly saying: “Not to worry, our state-of-the-art teaching equipment will be able to get you playing in just a couple of months.” The horse, delighted in this information immediately takes up the lesson and sure enough, becomes a master at the piano in just a month.

The horse invited his friend chicken to his house to show him what he learned. The chicken, amazed by his new talent he decides that he wants to learn the guitar to join the horse so he calls up the local music teacher asking for lessons. He says “I’d like to learn how to play the guitar but there’s one problem. I’m a chicken.” The music teacher responds quickly saying: “Not to worry, our state-of-the-art teaching equipment will be able to get you playing in just a couple of months.” The chicken, excited to join his friend horse, immediately started lessons and after a month, he was able to join horse and play with him.

The two invited raccoon over to horse’s house to show him what they had done. Racoon was fascinated by it and wanted to join so decided to take up the drums to join their band. He calls the music teacher asking for lessons. He says “I’d like to learn how to play the drums but there’s one problem. I’m a raccoon.” The music teacher responds quickly saying: “Not to worry, our state-of-the-art teaching equipment will be able to get you playing in just a couple of months.” The raccoon starts his lessons immediately and after a month, he is able to join horse and chicken in their band.

Sheep was visiting horse’s house and they decided to show them what they could do. Sheep decided that the group needed a vocalist and called up the music teacher asking for voice lessons. He says “I’d like to learn how to sing but there’s one problem. I’m a sheep.” The music teacher responds quickly saying “Not to worry, our state-of-the-art teaching equipment will be able to get you singing beautifully in just a couple of months.” after a month, sheep was able to join the trio and they had a band. They called themselves “animal farm”

The band quickly became famous and they had concerts all around the world. They were about to board the plane for their biggest concert yet when the horse learned that his mother was very ill and that she would most likely not make it. The horse told the other bandmates he wouldn’t be able to come as he would have to visit his mother. The others know that horse would have to see his mother but they knew they couldn’t cancel the show so they all came up with an idea. Horse would fly back to his mother’s house where he would spend a couple of days with his mother before she passed on while the other band members would grab the next flight to the concert and stay there for a while waiting for horse. They all agreed and horse flew back to see his mother.

Horse’s mother passed away a day after he got home. He attended the funeral and was walking back when he saw on the newspaper “animal farm in a fatal plane incident. No survivors have been found.” The horse, feeling bad for himself decided to go to the pub to try and drink his problems away. He went up to the bar and the barman looked at the horse and said: ""Why the long face?"""

My wife divorced me, and here I am.” The homeless man finished.

“Wow,” the man replied, “What a story! Though I’m still confused as to why you were fired.”

On a hot summers day, the Maharaja calls on his trusted advisors and ask them what the best feeling in the world is.

A lot of feelings go into the pool, happiness, orgasms, seeing your child being born, and so on.

When it comes time for Gopal bhaar, he says, my king, the best feeling is pooping. 

The court blows up with laughter and the king asks how that's possible.

One day, Gopal bhaar invites the king and the other advisors to his home for a meal and feeds them polao and biryani and brain masala and the works. After everybody has finished eating, they all on go on a trip in Gopal bhaar's boat down the river. 

With all the rich food in their gut, pressure is building. Gopal offers a rich yogurt drink to help with digestion. More pressure builds.

The king orders Gopal to park the boat so that could get off and do their business.

The king of ignored. After some more time, the king, now unable to contain himself and his rage tells Gopal to park. 

As the king and his advisors run into the trees to relieve themselves, they are return with smiles of relief on their face and no sign of hostility.

Gopal turns to the king and asks, my king, does pooping give you the best feeling? The king smiles and announces Gopal was right.

The salesman loses his patience. he is puffing and grumbles at the guy: ""We're a fucking music store. How many times do you want me to tell you I'm not selling the heater and the umbrella stand?"""

" A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate. 

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."" 

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..."" 

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing."

"He's run out fuel but he is a skilled enough pilot to guide his aircraft down and gracefully crash into the sand.  He comes in at a small angle and exits his vehicle without a scratch on him.

""Damn it, what could have gone wrong?"" He ponders for a short while before he starts assessing the damages.  The propeller is mangled but the wings are intact. He sees his landing gear ripped off the plane and sticking up in the sand 15 meters away.  Thinking that he'll be able to salvage and repair his plane he walks over to the detached parts and starts digging through the sand to collect all the pieces.  He uncovers a chunk of metal that is brass, an unusual metal for airplanes.  Curious, he rubs off the layers of dirt to reveal a foreign language that begin to glow.
Smoke pours out of the now obvious antique oil lamp and forms into a genie. 

""Thank you kind stranger, it has been many years since I have been trapped in that lamp.  As a show of gratitude I will grant you one wish!  I am a genie, not a fool so do not try to abuse my power.  Give me good reason not to turn your desires against you and I will not.""

After a few moments of chin scratching and looking around him, the man responds.  ""I'm constantly making the same mistakes, over and over.  Take this for instance, this is my second air plane.  I can never figure out what I'm doing wrong. Please, Mr. Genie,  I wish for better hindsight""

With a raised eyebrow and a short pause the Genie asks ""Are you really sure this what you want?""

""Yes!"" The man answers with no hesitation.

""It is done!"". With a loud gust of wind the genie flies out to sea.  The man sits in the sand and looks out towards the sunset.  ""I should have fueled up before I left!"" He says as he puts his face into his palms. 

He looks up in horror.  ""I should have wished for better foresight!"""

They run into the barn and hide in some barrels they find there. Shortly after the sheriff and his deputy show up looking for them. 
The sheriff looks around and asks his deputy to check the barn while he goes and checks the fields. The deputy, a lazy guy, pops into the barn. He sees some barrels, some hay, but nothing really interesting. He heads back out to the car. The sheriff asks, “did you find anything interesting?”
The deputy replies, “Just a couple of barrels and some hay”
“Did you check the barrels?”
“No...”
“Go check the barrels!”
The deputy heads back to the barn, grumbling as he goes. When he arrives, he decides instead of checking each one, he was just going to kick them. 
He kicks the first one, with the red head. 
“Meow!”
Just a stupid cat...
He kicks the second one, with the brunette. 
“Woof! Woof!”

br34kf4s7	2021-04-26 01:47:43+00:00	Three men crash in a plane over the Amazon rainforest and are immediately captured by cannibals	"To their surprise, the cannibals don't immediately kill them. Instead, they show the men (through pictures and such) the beginning of an ancient ritual which, upon successful completion by the men, will result in their freedom.

For the first step, they are instructed to go off into the jungle and collect ten pieces of a single kind of fruit.

The first man comes back triumphantly holding ten oranges. He is overcome with dismay when the second part of the ritual is revealed to him: he must now put all ten of the fruits up his ass without making the slightest noise, or he will be killed.

He fits an entire orange up there but when he starts to put the second in, he whimpers in pain. The cannibals kill him on the spot, roast him, and eat him.

The second man returns with a handful of ten grapes. The second part of the ritual is also explained to him, and he feels confident he can succeed. Sure enough, he starts popping them in his rectum one by one, and eventually is left with only one grape to go. However, as he is about to insert it, he suddenly bursts out laughing. The cannibals murder him and eat him.

The two men meet each other up at the Pearly Gates. The first man can't believe it.

""You were almost there!"" He says to the second man. ""You could've lived! Why did you laugh?""

""Because,"" says the second man, ""I saw the third guy coming back with pineapples."""

Woman: ""I've never been hugged before.""

The man moved by compassion leans down and gives her a hug and begins continuing down the beach.  Seconds after he leaves, he hears her sobbing once more and turns around.

Man: ""What's wrong now?""

Woman: ""I've never been kissed before.""

The man bends down and gives her a kiss on the cheek then continues on his way once more.  A few seconds later she starts crying uncontrollably and the man thinks, ""My God, what now??""  He turns back to her.

Man: ""What's the matter now?""

Woman: ""I've never been fucked before.""

The man then proceeds to pick up the woman and throw her into the ocean and says: ""Now you're fucked!"""

The 2 martians got off the ship, and began to ask the gas pump questions. “What’s your name” one Martian asked. No reply. “How old are you”... still no reply. Finally, one of the martians decided enough was enough, and pulled out his laser blaster, and shot the gas pump. The two martians were blown into the air, and landed across the street.

PixelPete2	2021-04-25 19:42:07+00:00	Old farmer Joe just uses all his savings to buy 51 sheep...	"To pass the season he plans to reproduce the 50 female sheep he bought with one ram doing the work.  


 To his misfortune the ram dies suddenly just after he got it. He goes to complain to his neighbor Bob about his problems and Bob, who also was a farmer, told him he had to do the job himself to impregnate the sheep.

""Are you insane!"" exclaims Joe  


""The same happened to Billy last year"" Said Bob, ""He did the job himself and it worked.""

""You gotta get the truck every morning, get the sheep in, take them to the hills and do the job. If in the afternoon, the sheep are in the shade beneath the trees, it means they are gravid.""

So farmer Joe, with no other recourse, wakes up next morning at 6 am and takes the sheep up the hill. He goes one by one, huffing and puffing until mid day. He comes home exhausted and lays in bed, when the afternoon comes, he can't get out of bed of exhaustion and he calls his wife Helen.

""HELEN, ARE THE SHEEP IN THE SHADE BENEATH THE TREES!?""

""No Joe"", says the old lady, ""They are out on the sun"".

So, next day farmer Joe goes and does exactly the same as the day before. One by one, huffing and puffing and hissing. He drives back in his truck and is absolutely and completely depleted.

He goes to bed out of tiredness and exclaims when the afternoon arrives ""HELEEEN, ARE THE SHEEP IN THE SHADE OR THE SUN?!""

&amp;#x200B;

""They are in the sun, Joe"", says Helen. 

&amp;#x200B;

So farmer Joe is very determined to do this, as he might lose his lively hood if the sheep don't reproduce.

&amp;#x200B;

He wakes up next morning, takes the sheep in his truck to the hills, and again huffing, puffing, hissing, he goes one by one until he is finished with all. He heads back home, lays in bed utterly and miserably dog-tired. After a couple of hours he calls his wife Helen, ""HELEEEEN, ARE THE SHEEP IN THE SHADE THIS TIIIME?!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""No Joe"" says Helen confused ""They are in the truck honking the horn!"""

"They approach the figure and he introduces himself. “I am the magical genie of Arizona. When you go over this cliff, say something you desire. I will summon it for you to land on at the bottom of the cliff.” The men are a little uncertain. 

The first one peers over the edge of the cliff and figures he will be the first to try it. He backs up and takes a running start then jumps off the cliff. He shouts “A billion dollars!” With a wave of his hand, the genie creates a pile of dollar bills that cushion the man’s fall. 

The other two men see that their friend is ok, and are excited to try their luck. The second man runs and jumps. “The softest clouds ever!” Once again, the genie grants that wish and the second man lands on the clouds and they gently carry him away. 

The third man leans over the edge. He tries to come up with his answer, and the genie grows impatient. The third man is still thinking when the gravel beneath him crumbles and he falls over the edge. “SHIIIIIIIT!!!”"

Spotting an old beachcomber standing on the shore, the tourist shouted:

“Are there any gators around here?!”

“No,” the man hollered back, “they ain’t been around for years!”

Feeling safe, the tourist started swimming leisurely toward the shore. About halfway there he asked the guy:

“How did you get rid of the gators?”

“We didn’t do nothin’,” the beachcomber said. “The sharks got ’em."""

OyVeyzMeir	2021-04-25 16:27:09+00:00	"A US Navy cruiser anchored in Mississippi for a week's shore leave. The first evening, the ship's Captain received the following note from the wife of a very wealthy and influential plantation owner:"	"""Dear Captain, Thursday will be my daughter's Debutante Ball. I would like you to send four well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their formal dress uniforms to attend the dance. They should arrive promptly at 8:00 PM prepared for an evening of polite Southern conversation. They should be excellent dancers, as they will be the escorts of lovely refined young ladies. One last point: No Jews please.""

Sending a written message by his own yeoman, the captain replied:
""Madam, thank you for your invitation. In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, I am sending four of my best and most prized officers. One is a lieutenant commander, and a graduate of Annapolis with an additional Masters degree from MIT in fluid technologies and ship design. The second is a lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of Northwestern University in Chicago, with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering. His Masters Degree and PhD. in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering are from Texas Tech University and he is also an astronaut candidate. The third officer is also a lieutenant, with degrees in both computer systems and information technology from SMU and he is awaiting notification on his Doctoral Dissertation from Cal Tech. Finally, the fourth officer, also a lieutenant commander, is our ship's doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North Carolina . We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in Trauma Surgery at Bethesda.""

Upon receiving this letter, Melinda's mother was quite excited and looked forward to Thursday with pleasure. Her daughter would be escorted by four handsome naval officers without peer (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous). At precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda's mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, four very handsome, smiling black officers.

Her mouth fell open, but pulling herself together, she stammered, ""There must be some mistake.""

""No, Ma'am,"" said the first officer. ""Captain Goldberg never makes mistakes."""
Samuelabra	2021-04-25 16:24:01+00:00	I Lost My Hat	"One Sunday before a church service, a priest notices a man sitting in a pew who he has not seen in years.

The priest approaches and says, ""Wow! I can't remember the last time I saw you here! What brings you here today?""

The man replies, ""Good morning, father! Well you see, ten years ago I lost my hat and I have come to get it back!""

The priest replies, ""Ten years? What makes you think it would be here after all that time?""

""Good question father,"" replies the man. ""It's not exactly my hat, but I know that Solomon comes here every Sunday and he wears the same hat. So I figured that when he goes into confession, I'll just nip on over and take it for myself!""

The priest is a bit disappointed, but leaves the man to his devices.

The service goes on as normal, and afterwards the priest notices that the man is still sitting there with no hat.

""Well,"" says the priest. ""Looks like you changed your mind! I'm glad!""

The man replies, ""Oh yes, father! You see, I was going to take Solomon's hat, but I was listening to your service this morning and it really resonated with me. I especially enjoyed the part about the Ten Commandments!""

With a bit of smugness, the priest says, ""Ah, so you must have liked the part about 'Thou Shalt Not Steal'?""

""Not quite, father,"" says the man. ""It was actually the one about 'Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery' and I remembered where I left my hat!"""

""Is Buddhism dying?"", he thought. Right after that, he sees a young monk entering a building with some bags of flour and sugar and decides to follow him. 

What he found was stunning. On one side, lots of young monks cracking eggs, adding sugar and mixing flour. On the other side, some other monks cutting strawberries, making chocolate sauce and tiering in every table. ""Probably it's a celebration day and they are preparing something for the old monks"", he thought.

At that moment he looks straight forward and finds a monk who looks to be in charge. He goes to that monk and asks ""what are all these young monks doing here? Is this this some kind of celebration?""

The monk laughs and tells him ""No, this isn't any celebration at all. These monks are only doing everything they can to better their souls"". The man got confused about it. ""How can cooking help to better a soul?"" he asked.

The monk with a big smile on his face replies ""Well, young generations found out that having cake is the best way to gain Karma"""

One night he’s in bed and she turns off the light to make it harder for him to realize their trick. She makes up a last minute excuse to leave the room and a minute or two late he hears what he assumes is her coming back into the room and climbing into bed.

They start making out and end up having incredible sex. At some point in the night they switched back.

He woke up next to his girlfriend and she smiled, asking if he enjoyed “our sex”. He explained to her he’d been onto them the whole time and that he knew it wasn’t her from the very start.

She looked at him shocked and asked how he knew.

He said, “your hands are smaller than his.”"

He soon realized she was heading straight towards his seat.

As fate would have it, she took the seat right beside his.

Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, ""Business trip or pleasure?""

She turned, smiled and said, ""Business. I'm going to the Annual Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston."" 

He swallowed hard. 

Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs. 

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your business role at this convention?"" 

""Lecturer,"" she responded. ""I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about it."" 

""Really?""  he said. 

""And what kind of myths are there?"" 

""Well, she explained, ""One popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait."" 

""Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Jewish descent who are the best."" 

She went on, ""I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck."" 

Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed. 
""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don't even know your name...""

The husband asks, ""Do you want to go on the helicopter?""

The wife replies, ""Well it would be fun but 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

So the couple decides not to go and moves on.

The next year, they come back to the county fair and the helicopter rides are there again. The husband asks again, ""What do you think, should we go on it?""

""I don't know,"" the wife says. I know it would be great to go up there but 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

So the couple decides not to go.

The following year, they come back and the husband says, ""I really think we can do it this time! What do you think - should we go on the helicopter?""

The wife says, ""I'm really not sure - I would really love to, but 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

The pilot of the helicopter overhears this conversation and says to the couple, ""Excuse me - I couldn't help but notice that you were having some trouble deciding. Well I'll tell you what - I will take the both of you up in the helicopter, and if you don't make a single sound whatsoever while we're up there, then the whole ride is free. What do you say?""

The couple thinks for a few minutes, then finally agrees to take the deal.

So the pilot takes them both up in the helicopter, and they are completely silent. In order to try and get his money's worth, the pilot purposely makes this a shaky, uncomfortable ride, making sharp turns, jostling the copter, hoping that the couple will crack. But alas, no such luck - the pilot does not hear a peep for the entire ride.

The pilot lands the helicopter and says, ""Well, a deal's a deal! I have to say, I really thought I was going to get you guys - I'm impressed!""

And the husband replies, ""Yeah, I about said something when my wife fell out, but 50 dollars is 50 dollars!"""

I sat down next to him, and I offered to buy him the next pint. He agreed, and I took the opportunity to ask him why he was drinking so hard.

He looked deep into the pint, and with a sigh said ""I am the keeper of Her Majesties Corgis.""

""That's not that bad, is it?"" I asked

""Aye, 'tis brutal... dealing with multiple generations of inbreeding, nasty tempers and shit and piss everywhere.""

""Yes, I can see dealing with dogs can be quiet the challenge."" I offered.

Realizing that they would die too in a day or two they asked each other if they had any wishes. The Bishop asked if he could see the nun naked. The nun didn't like idea but then thought it could be their last day and as such the Bishop was a nice person. So she took off her clothes. 

Then she thought about her wish. She had never seen a naked man before. So she asked if she could see the bishop naked. The Bishop obliged. The nun points at the Bishop's thingy and asked, ""What's that?"" 

The Bishop didn't want to do a lot of explanation under the hot sun and replied, ""This is the life giver.""

Saint Peter opens the door, looks at him and says: ""Welcome to live after death. What is your name?"" The pope is slightly irritated and answers: ""I am the pope."" ""Pope who?"", Peter asks. ""Pope Francis, you should know who I am!"" the pope says, a bit upset. Peter looks into his book and says: ""Hmm, I can't find a Francis Pope in here. Are you sure you are at the right place?"" The pope doesn't understand what's going on: ""This must be a misunderstanding. I am the pope, god's representative on earth!"" Peter looks at him: ""Oh. I'm not aware the boss sent somebody down to earth to represent him. Please wait a minute, I'm going to talk to him.""

So Peter goes to god's throne and says: ""Boss, there's this guy at the door, he says his name is Pope and he insists he is your representative on earth. Do you know anything about that?"" God answers: ""I don't know what he means. Maybe we could ask Jesus?""

So they call Jesus and tell him what's going on. Jesus says: ""I don't know what this guy is talking about either, but I'm going to talk to him."" So he goes to heaven's door to talk to the pope. A few minutes later he comes back, laughing: ""Peter, you won't believe this. Do you remember that fishing club we've founded back in our time? It still exists!"""

She was afraid she might have something wrong with her, so she decided to seek the medical expertise of a sex therapist. Her doctor recommended that she see Dr. Chang, the well-known Chinese sex therapist, so she went to see him.

Upon entering the examination room, Dr. Chang said, ""OK, take off all you crose."" The woman did as she was told. ""Now, get down and craw reery, reery fass to odder side of room."" Again, the woman did as she was instructed. Dr. Chang then said, ""OK, now craw reery, reery fass back to me."" So she did.

Dr. Chang shook his head slowly and said, ""Your probrem vewy bad. You haf Zachary Disease. Worse case I ever see. Dat why you not haf sex or dates.""

Worried, the woman asked anxiously, ""Oh my God, Dr. Chang, what is Zachary Disease?""

Former_Rush_752	2021-04-25 07:02:55+00:00	"Best jokes you've never heard, Part two."	"A woman would like to take a trip cross country with her parrot. However, when she goes to book the flight, she realizes that she only has enough money for a flight that's non-smoking and no parrots allowed. With a plan in mind, she purchased the ticket and decided to take a chance and hopefully get away with it. She gets through security with no problem, with her pet parrot stuffed in her jacket, and is on the flight in no time with little to no setbacks along the way. Sitting comfortably in her chair on the plane, she is ready to travel.

In the middle of the flight, the pilot came out of the cockpit smoking a massive cigar and was greeting all the people on the plane. He slowly but surely is approaching the woman.

""How's is your flight going, Ms.?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh it's going just fine, thank you""

&amp;#x200B;

As he started to walk away he heard something muttered from behind

&amp;#x200B;

""Poly want a cracker"" 

&amp;#x200B;

He quickly turns around and asks the woman what that noise was

&amp;#x200B;

""Nothing, nothing don't worry""

&amp;#x200B;

Confused he turned back around and proceeded to walk down the aisle.

&amp;#x200B;

""Poly want a cracker""

&amp;#x200B;

He flips around again and stares into the woman's eyes. He then rips open her jacket to reveal the parrot sitting happily in its cage. 

&amp;#x200B;

""THIS IS A NO PARROT FLIGHT!"" he shouts, as he grips the parrot in his palm, opens up the plane window, and chucks it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

""OH YEAH? WELL, THIS IS A NO SMOKING FLIGHT!"" as she rips the cigar from his lips and throws it out the window. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the altercation, the pilot storms off back to the cockpit, obviously flustered and regains control of the plane. Minutes go by and then there is a slight \*tap\* \*tap\* \*tap\* on the window. It's the woman's parrot. And he has something in its mouth. The Brick."
Former_Rush_752	2021-04-25 07:01:58+00:00	"Best jokes you've never heard, Part one."	"I label this joke as part one, because it may not land so I hope to make up for that in the following part, however, I would love pointers on this joke as I plan on using it. Anyways, here's the joke; 

Three friends are gathered around a pile of bricks, one of them mutters

""let's see who can throw a brick the highest""

They all grab hold of brick and get ready to compare throwing heights. One of them realizes that it would be impossible to judge how high the bricks went from the ground. Luckily it had rained and the ground they were standing on was completely muddy. With this fact, they will be able to tell who can throw the highest by measure how far in the ground the brick sank.

The first friend gathers up his energy and launches a brick high into the sky, the brick falls down and sinks 3 feet into the dirt. The second friend scoffs at this ""pathetic"" attempt and launches a brick even higher, and it sinks 5 feet into the ground. The third friend laughs and his friend's lame excuses of throws, and launches a brick so high into the sky, and it never comes down. He lost."

The criteria is who died the worst death. He pulls them aside one by one for testimony. The first says ""I believed my wife was cheating. I pretended to drive away, waited down the block for an hour, and rushed home. I burst in to take stock, saw that my wife was in the shower, and searched high and low for the lover I feared Id find. I nearly gave up when I noticed a man hanging by his fingertips off my balcony. Enraged, I beat and kicked viciously at his fingers. He held on so I whipped out a hammer and bludgeoned his grip free. He fell 2 stories but was still alive. I grabbed the refrigerator (it weighed a ton) and pushed it off the ledge, crushing him to death. I immediately was overwhelmed with remorse and shot myself in my bedroom."" The Saint, looking a mixture of disgust and remorse, thanks him and pulls aside the next man, who says, ""I was practicing yoga on the rail of my 4th floor apartment when a gust suddenly tipped my over. Luckily I managed to grab the rail on the floor below me. Then this madman runs out and starts wailing on my hands. I cling for dear life pretty well until the hammer came out. I thought I made it when a bush broke my fall, but then the last thing I see is this refrigerator coming down."" Shocked and moved, the Saint shares his condolences and moves to the last man.

RubyBlye	2021-04-24 23:58:23+00:00	Thankfully it's not another virus we have to worry about.	"The police have found a large number of dead crows on the 101 just north of
Ventura early this morning, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu
A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed
the problem was NOT Avian Flu.
The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it
was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws.
By analyzing these paint residues it was found that 980 of the crows had been impacted by
 motorcycles, while only20 were impacted by cars.
The investigators then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a
cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills.
The Ornithological Behaviorist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill,
they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the
lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike"""

Corey owned a business where he sold drapery for windows, and he was doing very well!

His business was thriving and making money. It was probably because he was a very friendly person who promised his customers 100% satisfaction on everything he sold. People knew him to be timid and frail, but he also perseveres to bring people service with a smile.

And that's when three thieves saw an opportunity. 

They decided to rob his store and take all his money. ""He's a big softy, robbing him will be easy!"" they thought.

Later that night, the three thieves walk into his store, pretending to be shopping. Corey greeted them with the usual hello, but noticed something off about them, and that's when the three each pulled a knife on him.

""Alright Corey! Give us all your money!"" the three men said.

Yet Corey hesitated. Instead of shrinking from fear, a fire started to brew in him, and that's when he yelled ""LIKE HELL I WILL!""

And the fight of a lifetime broke out!

Corey was outnumbered three to one and the odds were against him but he went at them anyway. Fists were thrown knocking down everything in the store. Windows were shattered by people being thrown through them. Corey's precious drapery got torn off the hooks. Knives were disarmed, bones were broken, and noses were bleeding all over the place.

And then... it was over. The three men lay on the ground, broken and bruised. Corey had won the battle.

How was a drapery salesman able to beat up three thugs armed with knives at night you ask?

That's easy.

I am taking part in a meditation fundraising challenge and I wondered whether some of you would be interested in supporting.

For my challenge I aim to meditate for 100 minutes, every day, for 10 days. My challenge will begin on Sunday 2 May and run through to Tuesday 11 May. 

I am doing this to raise money for the NSPCC. The NSPCC is the only charity fighting to end child abuse in the UK and Channel Islands. I am hoping to raise vital funds so that the NSPCC can continue to protect children at risk and help children who’ve been abused to rebuild their lives.  

I am sure some of you frequently meditate for more than 100 minutes a day, but for me this will definitely be a challenge! Nonetheless I'm determined to give it my best, even if my mind gets distracted a lot!

Any money you can spare will help the NSPCC to be there for every child.

cvntcvntcvnt	2021-04-30 17:23:01+00:00	The Beginning of a Breakthrough? Any Advice Appreciated	"**TL;DR**: Feel a separation between myself and experience that was always there. Finally got to the bottom of it (?) but still a long way to go. Any pointers or advice that you guys have? Any similar experience?

I will try to be as concise as I can.

Recently, there's been a little bit of frustration while meditating. The issue that I've been having again and again is noticing that I was lost in thought, then focusing on the in-breath, but then when the out-breath happens, I immediately plunge back into think think think.

Also, as I've been meditating, I've noticed that there always felt like this separation between me and what I was focusing on. Interestingly, the separation or wall is there the most with breathing and physical sensations (including the breath). It's kind of there for sight, and it's the least there for sound.

Anyways, by separation I mean that I'm noticing the breath, but not \*really\* noticing. My attention isn't fully there, and my mind is going and going and going in the background so I can't concentrate. My attention from my mind is never released.

Today while meditating, I had two ideas. First: ""Wait a second! Is this how I've been my entire life?!"" Second: ""I have to observe this separation.""

And that's what I did. I observed this wall that I have between me and experience, I was noticing the think think think of my mind. And I feel like something opened up afterwards. It's like I was looking at my experience of life for the first time ever. That ""opening"" happened rather late in the meditation session, so I didn't get a good look.

Am I onto something here? Does anyone have a comparable experience? Would love to hear any anecdotes or advice.

Thanks, love you all."

When I start learning something new I like to dive right in so any information you have would be greatly appreciated!!!"

evervenescence	2021-04-30 15:59:24+00:00	Am i the only one? Neurotically trying to conceptualise existence making me depressed.	"hey folks,

ever since i can remember, like even as quite a little child, from time to time i had these thoughts about our existence and where it leads to after all and when i let them take turns, it can take me to a seemingly endless mindfuck. At some point the string of thoughts ""stops"". But it feels more like i take a muffled down version of the resulting desperation into the rest of the day/week/life.

I also tend to feel pretty alone when i'm aware of this ""problem"", like everyone taking their life experience so serious and making the most out of it being obsessed with their current jobs and partners etc. and i just can't seem to do so while this question is still bothering me.

So it is that my mind can't comprehend the concept of death or sudden non-existence, which is kind of normal i guess by itself. But then i jump right to endless existence, which is something i believe more in but it also frightens me way more? Dunno, just that i am existing now, without being able to ""remember"" anything that would have been before. And after death? Does this cycle just go on like this for litterally ever? I mean something tells me there can't be any end to it and this really frightens me. Like really visualising this in my mind and making this thought come alive in all depth of it. That i/we are already here as consciousness and i can't really decide what happens to/with me...

Dunno maybe i should just get a job finally and trying to take this life experience for all that i have like seemingly everybody around me does. I feel like this is the magic key to not having this endless ""deep"" streams of thought....but then i just seem to be obsessed with philosophising endlessly about what could be (also what could have been) although i see it doesn't take me anywhere good...and this seems to hinder me of taking small steps in building my current life experience and taking shit serious.

hope you're all well!"
JMCochransmind	2021-04-30 15:56:37+00:00	Being Sober is Beautiful.	" I was an addict for more years of my life than I was sober. I used opiates to deal with the mental pain of life. I'm not going to write a sob story, but my life growing up wasn't sunshine and roses as I'm sure is the same for most people who are addicted. I was getting so far gone and pushing the pain I had gone through in life so far down and not dealing with it, that it was rotting inside of me. It was starting to make me legitimately crazy. I cared some, but not much, and not enough to get off drugs. I had tried before just to stop, but I didn't realize how much work was going to be involved, what I was in for, or where to begin. It took me three years of trying different methods like methadone, rehab, suboxone, meditation and therapy to finally get to the starting line of what I thought was the path to sobriety.

While going through all of this it was like I was marching up a snowy mountain with a backpack on. I was tightly holding my shoulder straps, trudging through the snow uphill one step at a time. After a couple of months I would lift my head up to see I was still in the exact same place. So again, I put my head down and trudged on. For over a year it seemed like I was in the same place every time I looked up. I had learned a lot though while walking. I truly learned the meaning of patience and calmness and finally understood this is a marathon not a sprint. I learned that hope was the only thing I had in the most desperate times when I felt like just giving up and setting down in the snow, not to care anymore. In the mind of my mind, I was climbing a ladder or the steps of a pyramid. Every lesson was like an ascension of knowing who I was and what I had to do. Like going through the chakras to start at red over and over again, growing the whole time.

One day things changed a little as I felt some tension release. I didn't realize I was over the crest, just knew it was starting to get easier and I felt myself descending down the other side. Still learning in the mind of my mind lessons to take with me. I learned it is okay to just be okay with yourself. That being ashamed and the fear and anxiety that came along with it weren't going to help me on my travels, so I had to shed that baggage to get where I wanted to be. People don't look at you and see what you think of yourself. They just see what is in front of them at that moment. So, if you're doing better, that is the picture you project. They don't know the challenges you're facing in your mind and body to just make it through the day. So again, my head down I keep trudging through the snow down the side of the mountain.

One day I felt something completely different. I had accepted the snow and the mountain and without knowing where I was, I look up and there isn't any snow. I'm coming into a valley with a beautiful meadow, and I can shed some of my baggage knowing I'm in a better place. I still have my journey ahead but I'm feeling better about each step, still learning in the mind of my mind. I have this energy inside of me that wants to persevere. I want to be a good person and give off a good energy for others to realize anything is possible.

Feeling light and free I walk to the edge of the meadow with my shoulders tall and straight from everything I've carried and learned to cope with. The mind of my mind gave way to me being myself and knowing who I was. I felt whole once more. As I make my way through the trees there is a beautiful little stream. I wash myself and stand up a clean person, free and ready to face the world as I had never known before. As I look around with my eyes clear, in that moment I realize, this is beautiful!"

astillmind23	2021-04-30 14:29:15+00:00	What I’ve learned after 13 years practice and 5 years teaching	"If you’re not practicing to surrender, you’re not going to advance. The mind does not go where the real meditation is, you must drop it through surrender. Then you start to experience what meditation is. 

Very unpopular truth... most don’t understand what meditation is. The same way that Jane Fonda was leading the ‘exercise’ trend in the 80s, mindfulness apps and similar practices are today. We’re only scratching the surface. 

True yoga is the key to uncovering your own unique gifts and abilities to ensure you can live your most fulfilled life. 

I honestly don’t know how to properly convey this but I’ll keep working on sharing it with as many people as possible in my life. To realise it is to upgrade your life in ways only previously imagined."

EmotionalAd7741	2021-04-30 12:31:04+00:00	Taking a break from meditation.	"I started meditation roughly a year ago from now, switching through various types of meditation every now and then. I have been seeing minimal to no changes in my mental state. I still have anxiety, negative thoughts, frustration, etc. In fact recently all of those negative feeling seemed to amplify 5x, it’s like I’m in this loop. Everyone says stop having expectations about meditation, but it’s literally human nature. I want to see what happens to my mental state if I take a break from meditation for a couple weeks or so to see if it is truly helping me."
fxthea	2021-04-30 12:21:11+00:00	The value of returning to the breath	"Wanted to share a recent insight I had that maybe will help someone else see the value and even benefit of having distractions SO THAT we can practice return to the breath. 

While sitting thoughts arise and we treat each thought like a ball we have to hold. And if we stop holding it in attention it’ll drop — which is true. 

Some thoughts were not that attached to, were not clinging to. We see these thoughts as rubber balls and we feel fine dropping them. It doesn’t feel that wrong to drop them. 

Then there are thoughts that are maybe more emotionally charged — thinking about a future event, planning for that event, remembering a past event, wondering why we did what we did — these thoughts feel more valuable and we see it as a glass ball. That if we drop it there’s a lot we lose. And at first when we drop these thoughts it does feel like you’re dropping and shattering a glass ball. 

So by returning to the breath even when there’s a strong pull to the thought is the practice of dropping more and more glass balls until we don’t mind dropping glass balls. 

Do this enough and we see that there is no thought that’s more valuable than another. 

Hopefully that helped!"

His main teaching to me has been - this is it, Its just this. There’s no concessions, or states of mind that can get you anywhere. 

It’s making me feel more and more that doing anything other than just accepting what is, is the minds attempt to stay in control. Even meditation is just the separate self attempting me do so something that it’ll never be able to do.

It’s a hard pill to swallow, and honestly mixing me up more than making things clearer. I can’t work out if this is a road block or an insight.

Could anyone help me get a bit of clarity? Thanks!"

m_chutch	2021-04-30 07:31:30+00:00	How do I find a spiritual mentor?	"I have been following a path of spirituality that began when I was 16 or so, with the ever-increasing awareness of the absurdity of human life. This was after I had realized that believing in God was directly in discordance with who I naturally was, a gay young man. My dad was my teacher of all things moral growing up, and while I disagree with his belief system now, I truly believe that he was acting out of an ultimate desire to love and discipline. 

I am graduating university this month. Over the last five years or so, I have been trying to find meaning. It became torturous at times, because despite reading existential and moral philosophy, researching Krishna, transcendental meditation, psychedelic drugs, Reading the Bhagavad Gita, meditating, etc., I was still not at peace. 

I feel like I am dedicated to the spiritual path, and I know that meditation is an access point for truth, real awareness. When I was meditating most was around 15 after reading the book 'Power of Now.'

During the weeks that followed reading that book, I felt that I was truly free. I was consistently choosing to be aware of what I was seeing and feeling, and not letting my thoughts take over. 

Somehow or another, I have gotten so deeply caught up in my life and my ego and my crisis of identity, that I slipped back into a constant state of trying to distract myself from silence, and from having to feel what it is like to be me. 

I'm hoping to find a spiritual teacher. I'm not sure if this is the right place to look, so if not my apologies. I would hope to talk with someone who is not particularly affiliated with a major religion.

thank you"

I have been meditating on and off for half a year, and in the periods where i meditate frequently, I've seen benefits such as controlling of urges and being more present.

I want to start meditating longer and daily, however, there is one thing I'm concerned about and would love some new perspective on. I tend to overthink, so keep that in mind.

I am a very creative person and a lot of my ideas comes to me when I am daydreaming and my mind is *wandering*. Because mindfulness and meditation discourages the endless wandering mind, I am concerned that I might miss out on some epiphanies or ideas while being more present.

I have been a longtime lurker of this sub and I've never read anything negative about meditation, it's always ""meditation saved my life"". If meditation gives you SO much, what does it take away?

Thanks for reading."

In the Post someone shared the experience of doing deep breathing exercises before meditating. He or she said that deep breathing enhanced his or her meditation dramaticaly. I couldnt find the post so here is my review.

 Over the last couple of days I had exactly the same experience. Normally I do 5min to max. 14min(my previous record) meditation during the day and before sleeping a guided bodyscan meditation. After doing the the deep breathing exercises I was able to meditate for 30min+ without a problem during the day, which is double of the max. time I was able to do before. I also believe it enhanced the effects of the meditation but that could be the fact that I meditated longer. 

Im very surprised by the positive effects it had in that short amount of time and I will definitly practice it daily right before I do my meditation during the day."

Hamiltonian5667	2021-04-29 23:56:12+00:00	"If you're having trouble maintaining awareness, try walking meditations."	"I've been meditating for about 30 minutes to an hour daily for the past few months, but I've found that the typical 'sit down with your eyes closed' meditations particularly challenging because my mind is usually exhausted, and so I tend to almost drift off into sleep, suddenly regain my awareness, and then start drifting off again. 

As an alternative, I've started walking meditations every other day which keep me alert and interested enough such that maintaining awareness is much easier. Walking meditations also have the added benefit of being able to maintain focus on the ever-changing world around you, and losing the 'self' in the sense of becoming fully immersed in the events outside the body. There are also techniques you can try, like imagining the world as a work of art, which cultivates a sense of wonder and appreciation in the mundane. I'm also starting to find that walking meditation cultivates a better understanding of the connection between the world and the mind. You start to see the relationship between the events going on around you and the way your mind responds/reacts to them. 

The downside of walking meditations is that you obviously still have to think about walking and maintain a certain level of vigilance (don't get hit by a car or a bike!), which prevents entering a deep state of silence and complete loss of ego. That's why I still do the 'eyes closed sit down' meditation every other day.

Anyways, just thought I'd share because this is something I've found useful. I'd be curious to hear if anyone else practices walking meditation or a balance between walking and silent (eyes closed) meditation."

Three days ago I started feeling that when I put my attention on some part of my body a knife or something else sharp is injuring me, creating a disgusting feeling and stopping me from relaxing myself. Basically, the knife thing keeps coming over and over ruining the meditation.

I tried three things with no results:

1 - I tried to note this thing and continue the meditation, but the knife feeling comes so fast that when I noted it, it's already too late, I already felt the knife injuring me with discomfort. I keep noting it but the idea keeps coming every time causing the same discomfort.

2 - I tried just to ignore the knife as fast as it comes, this way I don't feel the disgusting feeling at all, but this also keeps me from focusing on my body, because I'm just waiting to the knife idea to come and I cannot relax myself.

3 - I ended imaging that my body is surrounded by a thick armor, and nothing sharp can hurt me, but as before I have to keep thinking that I'm surrounded by an armor and I cannot focus on my body.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any mental disorder. What do you recommend me in this situation?"

soviedo20	2021-04-29 16:04:19+00:00	Attitudes and approach to self-observation and meditation. My personal note	"  

Hello everyone! This is my first post about meditation and my first post on Reddit. I've been practicing meditation (different types, and schools) on and off for 7 years and would like to leave you some personal feedback:  


I would like to make a personal observation about the **attitude stance** towards the thoughts we have. *In my experience* with meditation, thoughts are only a problem if they present a problem for us: if we believe what they say and that generates some kind of rejection. Otherwise thoughts are a natural element of the mind: Not that we are our thoughts or that all thought is useful. While one can indeed have the experience of not having thoughts or not focusing on them, this state is not always attainable, nor is it the most useful of all.

Just consider this: if we didn't really have any kind of emotional charge, or rejection of the content of thoughts then it wouldn't be a problem, it's only a problem because we have a rejection of the content, or what they represent: not that we can always ""have control over their elaboration"", they arise in consciousness along with self-identification, and ""we can't do much"" about it, it's a quite natural process.

If we think of thoughts as categorical and see their 'self-limitation' I think we can understand which ones may be more useful than others. By this I mean, if we take the attitude of: All thought is 'useless' in terms of: 'we are not the thoughts, let it all go' we have to think about how it affects the new generation of thoughts that arise because of this, given their self-reflective nature.

But if we approach meditation with a much more loving, patient, and really non-judgmental self-image of ourselves (less aggressive, less dramatic) and take time to accept that whatever content is going to come up is part of the process of getting better, and that we don't want to be that. I mean, actually having that ""background"" image of ourselves is much more effective than taking the attitude of ""losing all identity"" with thoughts. Because the thoughts are going to come anyway, mostly the ""more painful"" ones (which are self-identifying). Not that we can't have that experience of thoughts becoming less and less self-identifying. Even that is a good goal, but many are quick to jump to that place, but their mind is already ""problematic for themselves"". So it seems to me a perfectly valid concession to have a really much more positive attitude and it seems to me even crucial to prepare much more the set and setting of our mind and how we are going to face it than how we are going to transit or what might happen.

Again: if we didn't have problems with our thoughts per se, this natural issue of self-identification would not be a problem. But for many it is, so it is perfectly valid to have that approach. I would even say that if you have that conscious attitude as a background state of mind, of being aware of that negative self-talk and so self-critical of yourself, you will see how the subsequent process of meditation or even what you do during the day will meet less emotional resistance, at least in terms of anxiety, and depressive thoughts, and will be more peaceful. 

This is because thoughts are ""layered"" (to put it loosely and colloquially) and if we relate differently to the ""deeper"" thoughts the rest of the thoughts can arise without so much resistance: For example, if during the day we become more aware of the negative self-talk and the negative self-demands that we automatically place on ourselves and if we cultivate a truly loving and compassionate attitude towards ourselves, everything will have much less resistance, even when we start to have less and less of these ""problematic"" thoughts will be a mere anecdote for us because we know that we have a more positive attitude towards ourselves. I know that one also can take a different approach, more yogic if you like: ""we are not ANY content of our mind and we have to lose any kind of identification"". Not that I have a problem with this, but honestly, everyone's history of thinking is different and often ""getting to that state"" has a lot of difficulty, more emotional resistance and can generate a lot more load of new judgmental thoughts towards ourselves.

In my experience taking the approach of losing identity with every kind of thought or every kind of mental object of self-identification that arises is not as effective with the new thoughts that arise again. At least if I don't have that image in the background, or if I don't first consider the image I have of myself, an image of love, of compassion, of non-judgement. If we keep this in mind and are aware of the self-talk of the mind then we can take on the ability to peacefully observe the content of consciousness. And this can be like being more aware, more mindful, and taking that self-awareness as the ""object"" of focus.

No doubt many take the approach: ""But the self is an illusion and the best we can do is to lose any kind of identity with anything related to it"". I'm not saying it's a bad strategy, but in my experience having the attitude I mentioned above generates much less resistance in everything that arises than having the latter attitude.

PS: I know many would probably say: but that's because the ego likes not to lose its identity and so it feels more secure if it can keep control of its thoughts and they are happy, but it's an illusion and you have to fight with the ego or let the ego die.

For me the latter is optional, if one wants not to be dogmatic one might want to see and compare what works best in one's experience.

Anyway this is my experience and opinion, I hope it helps.

Greetings."

puteminnacoffin	2021-04-29 14:45:55+00:00	Meditating for fun	"Anyone else meditate just for fun sometimes? I started meditating about 7 years ago to combat my panic and self harm disorders, but after years of doing it and finding myself in some very fascinating head spaces, I often meditate just for fun. 

I don’t deal with the mental anguish that I used to deal with, so when I meditate I’m able to really sink into the moment for extended periods of time and have some spectacular experiences in my own head. For instance, last night I did 50 minutes with my eyes closed focusing on my breathing and occasionally centering my focus on one of my chakras. After about 30 minutes or so, When i shifted my focus and energy to my third eye in the center of my forehead, things started to get really weird. A bright, white light filled my field of vision and made my head feel really warm. 3d patterns and shapes came from nowhere and built off of each other, morphing and shifting into new ones. I lost feeling of my body and it felt like the only thing I was made of was my throat and lungs as the air traveled through them. Everything fades away. 

All of this stuff seemingly comes from something or somewhere else. Maybe it’s inside of me, maybe it’s outside of me, but these colors, spectacles, and feelings feel like they’re being channeled through me. It’s very fascinating and it puts me in the most relaxed and comfortable state. I feel like a sponge and I just want to just stay there forever sometimes. I also like to smoke a little weed sometimes and it makes these experiences more intense. 

Anyway, just felt like sharing with y’all. After years of using meditation to work through mental issues and the stresses of life, it’s fun to just use it as a tool to have some fun and explore my mind sometimes. Shit gets weird in there and it helps me connect with the wonder and fascination I experienced as a child. Let me know if y’all can relate. Much love, peace ❤️"
ChaoticSign	2021-04-29 14:44:27+00:00	Mindfulness of the Full Mind	"Consciousness, interacting through the subtle sense of physical awareness, may interact with the brain through this awareness.

This allows the brain to synchronise perfectly as one, which is why you then extend that awareness across your whole nervous system.

Truly feel your nervous system, keep in mind the function, and you will be utilising your entire nervous system correctly.

In this way, we can specifically focus on right-left brain communication by holding the focus of neurogenesis while visualising specific parts of the brain one at a time:

- The Pineal Gland
- The right brain
- The left brain
- The Frontal cortex (+left and right)
- The Amygdala

Allowing consciousness to reach these areas through the practice of your actual conscious awareness entering those places, so consciousness may have a bridge to begin experiencing the states of being these sides of the brain that (experientially) simulate your existence.

When I sit now I basically just experience my whole body and mind and breath as calmly as possible and try a little bit to relax or become more peaceful or feel some joy in the breath or being alive. My overall experience is 10% ordinary sensations of my body and the world and 90% this painful knot of tension and emotion in my head. The painful knot used to be this whole kundalini / dark night thing that had all this meaning and drama. Now it is just a painful knot I sit with. It is located where I had a head injury as a baby. I have been sitting consistently now for 9 years. I feel like that is some progress.

lookatmeicantype	2021-04-29 13:23:18+00:00	Can a beginner start with the meditation style taught by Sayadaw U Tejaniya?	"It has been a couple years since I've meditated tbh. 

Before that I was meditating for a couple years mainly using a noting vipassana technique similar to the technique Mahasi teaches. I say similar because I learned it from other sources.

I've decide I want to pick up a meditation practice again. It's been a while and I was going to possibly read a book from Mahasi and pickup where I left off with the technique I used in the past.

However, I stumbled upon a couple books recommended from Tejaniya and people describing his technique as a bit of a different take on an insight style of meditation. I was wondering if his style is appropriate for a beginner? I was also wondering if anyone could provide some advice or knowledge on it's different qualities or aims when compared to something like what Mahasi teaches?

I have been on and off meditation for the last decade. I have been consistent for months at a time usually and 2 years is my record at this point. Each time I go back to my same technique and one time I had tried a mantra based technique. I've found I have had the best experience personally with an insight noting technique usually with an anchor to my abdomen movement.

So personally I'd like to pickup again somewhere in that are, but this is my first time hearing about Tejaniya and what I'm hearing sounds interesting. It seems like it might be something that could perhaps click with me a little more than the noting technique I've done in the past if it's suitable for beginners. I wanted to get some other takes on this. Sorry for the long ramble but thanks for any advice or info."
Jax_Gatsby	2021-04-29 12:58:56+00:00	Don't buy into your thoughts.	"Throughout the day thoughts are always coming up, auditioning for your attention. For most of us, as soon as a thought pops up, we immediately identify with it; we buy into what it's selling us. And the instant we do that, we're immediately taken away from the peace that is always present *here* and *now.* I'm sure some of you have noticed how thoughts can easily snowball into dark places. This explains how someone can wake up happy but by the afternoon they already feel depressed, it's because they bought into their thoughts. 

Identifying with negative thoughts produces negative emotions and identifying with positive thoughts produces positive emotions. Reading that you might think that the goal should be to think positive and only identify with positive thoughts, but this isn't possible. Negative and positive thoughts are two sides of the same coin; you can't have one without the other. So the real solution is to stop identifying with thoughts altogether because we generally don't even decide what thoughts we have in the first place; our thoughts aren't even our own.

One of the best things I've learnt in my life is to not buy into my thoughts, to just watch them without engaging with them. Unfortunately the human mind has been conditioned for thousands of years to identify with thoughts so sometimes the mind identifies with thoughts without me even being aware of it, but another thing I've learnt is that mediation isn't about how long you can stay present but about how often you can bring your attention back to the present. Knowing this, I don't beat myself up when I catch the mind identifying with thoughts because that would just be more ego.

Realising all this made such an impact on me that it inspired me to write an album called ['Watching The Sky Fall'](https://open.spotify.com/album/3KyHX3SwPjbcAK2TOfzfVJ), which is essentially about the process of watching the mind and all it's craziness without identifying with it."

Maybe closely related to REM as it occurs whilst my eyes dart side to side. Movements range from being able to feel my legs walking to making my entire body undulate as if it were an ocean. Sometimes paired with a clicking at the base of my neck/top of spine.

I can only compare it to the feeling of sea legs, or how your body moves after being at the theme park for the day. Sometimes it is uncontrollable &amp; would grow more intense as i thought about it..but I have recently began to harness the powers of my brain and stop it when it becomes overpowering.

This has only recently become something I can control and i want to explore the sensations even deeper than the sense of touch/feeling.

Any explanations will be great &lt;3"

So I was having a guided meditation session. At one point, the man guiding the meditation said to observe everything that passed through my mind:

“All this can be done below the level of thought”

Now this was powerful with me as it evoked the idea/opinion that thinking is a choice. There are a myriad of things going on in your head and noticing them is normal. When we instead find ourselves thinking, we have chosen to magnify the importance of one of these passing thoughts/observations. And just as we chose to think, we can chose to revert to the normal circumstances... where we merely notice and stay aware

Am i right here? I feel like it is nothing groundbreaking but i wonder whether it is too much of a stretch."

Nature soothing sounds are highlighted by amazing relaxing and focus prompting music, tuned on 432 Hz. ❗  

➡️ Believe it or not, the sound of the breaking waves has a powerful healing effect on our mind and may induce deep states of relaxation. The sounds of the sea are Nature's music. Ocean sounds are music to our ears.  They provide the perfect natural white noise for calming and even healing our minds. 

🔥 These sounds are ideal for sleeping, relaxing, studying, working, reading a book, meditate, and even as soothing lullabies to a baby. Actually, it has been scientifically proven that ambient water sounds have a drowsing effect on humans. When we listen to slow, whooshing noises, our brains consider them to be non-threats and tend to calm us down. But they're also an effective therapy for people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or struggling with insomnia. Whether you're listening to the crashing of the waves, calm ocean waters, deep underwater sounds, tropical shoreline sounds, rainfall and thunderstorms, sounds of whales and dolphins, and squawking seagulls, they will have a positive impact on your mind.

Itsme66604	2021-04-29 07:06:05+00:00	Is Qigong and singing bowl chakra balancing legit?	"I’ve been thinking of taking meditation more serious and have found a private retreat that has caught my interest. It is a week long private 1:1 retreat consisting of only student/mentor and not in a group so it’s individually tailored. A day usually consists of - Daily Qigong classes, awakening/coaching, Tibetan singing bowl chakra balancing/healing sessions, Daily prayer and meditation session, including Qigong meditations. 

Has anyone got experience with any of these to say if they truly work or not?  My intention is to get away from normal everyday life to a retreat for around a week later this summer so I can detox and recalibrate my body to take meditation more serious and for spiritual growth.  However because of many con artists in western spirituality circles I’m not sure if it’s legit or not."

Galeaf_13	2021-04-29 04:58:44+00:00	Is meditation a placebo?	"I heard there are a lot of benefits from meditation (reducing anger, anxiety, better focus, etc.). But my question is, do this benefits apply just from the fact that you meditate or by you remembering that you meditate, so, for instance, you shouldn't be angry in one situation or another?  

I have this question because I meditate in the evening and don't remember that on the next day at all. Does this mean meditation is worthless for me? (Though, I really doubt it's the case, it's always good to know any caveats)"
That-Passion8515	2021-04-29 04:33:45+00:00	Beginning	When you first start meditating meditate with a smile and don’t stop until you come to a realization. It could take a short time or a very long time.
CHAlN	2021-04-29 03:32:13+00:00	Meditation analogy I experienced with a bumblebee	"I was sitting on a park bench today with some friends after we went for a run, and there was a bumblebee that kept hanging around us by the bench. We all were aware that bumblebees won't harm us if it doesn't feel threatened, but we're still not really fond of a bee getting that close to us, to the point where one of my friends jumped off the bench to get away.

Even though my body's natural reaction was to get away, I was tired from my run and didn't want to stand lol. Instead, I closed my eyes and imagined there was no bee there, and nothing to worry about or be scared of from sitting on that bench. Lo and behold, the bee ended up just minding its own business near me, and all the thoughts I had of the bee flying up my shorts or stinging me were all in my mind.

It was such a simple everyday situation, but I feel like it helped me understand how powerful it can be to quiet all the negative and excess thoughts in your mind."
Libertine74	2021-04-29 02:50:50+00:00	May I breathe with my mouth open? It makes a big difference!	"For the past three months, I have dutifully breathed in and out exclusively through the nose. Today I used both my mouth and nose and the difference was noticeable.  I was able to relax my body, sink into my body with a much deeper and thorough exhale. The air was much more “tactile” hence easier to regard as an object of attention.  Is there a good reason to avoid breathing through the mouth. What say you?"
poka1123	2021-04-29 02:14:33+00:00	Focus on breathing	"I recently started meditating, 10 days as it now. I practice meditation by focusing on my breath. But for last 2 days, I was not able to concentrate on my breathing. I keep a count of my breaths. I was always losing the count and getting frustrated.

Today I drank water before meditation and then I was able to focus on breaths and did not forget the counts. After a while, I did not need the count as I was enjoying to observe my breathe in and breathe out.

I mostly just watch and count my breath; and practice anulom vilom and kapal bhati( Indian meditating techniques)

Please provide additional tips and suggest some good book to read.

Have a good day!"
emmb1998	2021-04-29 01:52:07+00:00	How do I accept myself at my lowest point and still change? Advice needed!	"I was talking to a friend and realised in order to change I need to accept myself, but that is such a strange paradox? I’m at my rock bottom, sure things could be worse, but I want things to get better quickly. I have no patience. i want to have a job, I want to be physically healthy &amp; be thin, but I just keep hitting roadblocks, and I know it’s because I can’t accept myself right now. How do I do that and still change myself? How do I find kindness and compassion and acceptance for who I am in this moment so that I can change myself? Will the “acceptance” make me complacent and not want to change what needs changing? 
I keep failing at keeping any promises to myself , and I know there is a pattern here that I can’t see can anyone help me see it? 
Thanks any input to make this better would be appreciated thank you"

dansys	2021-04-29 00:48:19+00:00	Does this count as meditation?	"I’ve downloaded all the apps basically saying I’m going use the guided meditations to meditate everyday and I’ve failed at at so many times. 

The one thing I’ve been successful at is when I wake up in the morning, I have a glass of water while sitting in silence in bed. After I write in my dream journal if necessary. If the tv or fan is on, I turn it off and I honor that time of peace. I refuse to think about work or start planning for the day, or I brush those thoughts away when they arise. 

I’m thinking if I get away from the idea of sitting crossed legged for 20 minutes I’ll be more successful at developing a practice that fits my personality more."

friskyfrog224	2021-04-29 00:09:39+00:00	Having No Head While Teaching	"Hello. I recently received my 7-12 English certification to teach and currently, I am filling in for a teacher on maternity leave. I want to describe a recurring experience - or perhaps mode of experience - that continues to happen.

While Teaching, discussing, engaging with my students, my mindfulness will kick in and I will , not even consciously , turn attention upon itself (shout-out Sam Harris 🤑) and will see very clearly that I have no head. (If I was not educated on meditation and the jargon to go along with it, I would probably call it  a flow state , or just really in the zone. )

 I talk with my students, hear their discussions, respond, and it doesn't feel like 'I' am doing anything. For me, while teaching, the Insight is quite clear and it feels great!

However , as you may know , it is a very vulnerable mode of being. It's a very unguarded way of being and I fear, sometimes, that ... I don't know ... That I shouldn't be so open in front of my students. Its hard to describe. It feels like I am going to fall down a well and I am afraid too, afraid of being so raw and vulnerable , while in front of so many people (who are watching my every move). I suppose the ego would like to hang around...

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone has similar experiences in their occupation or day to day life."

twelvepillarscup	2021-04-28 22:28:33+00:00	How do you handle boredom?	"Do you just ""accept"" the boredom and be bored? I've dealt with depression my whole life so boredom often sinks into depression where I end up laying in bed. I do have hobbies but it's not enough."
GIPPINSNIPPINS	2021-04-28 22:13:24+00:00	I’ve started meditating on my own (without a guided video or sound). What types of exercises should I do?	"I recently started meditating on my own for about 10 minutes before I go to school. I am a religious person and love to start my meditation with a prayer for the day then I focus on my breath. I focus on the inhale and exhale. Sometimes I do a short body scan, but I’m not sure I get the point of them. My question to this wonderful and wise community is what things do you do in your meditations? Do you have exercise examples?


Also I would really like to thank all the people who post on this sub. The posts I see are so well thought out and wise. When I hit upvote on some of the posts I feel like it’s not enough because of how positively the post effected me. I’m sorry if you would tell me that I could give them an award, but sadly I cannot because of money reasons. Again I can’t wait to see your posts and stay in the moment the best you can. This moment only comes once."
The-Adster	2021-04-28 21:51:47+00:00	I am brand new to meditation and want some guidance	"Hello all.

Firstly, my apologies if this post does not follow the rules/guidelines (I skimmed them); I'm brand new to both meditation and this subreddit.

As of late, school is only allowing me to fit two to three 15-minute breaks, as well as one 30-45-minute break in my busy 16-hour day. Instead of using that time to watch pointless videos for my pleasure, I figured I should do something meaningful with my time (i.e., meditation).

I quite literally have no idea what I'm doing. I would like to participate in meditation during my longer 30-45-minute. break (which is usually at \~12:30 pm), after my lunch break. I need some help getting started:

* Is there a best time to meditate at?
* How many times per day should I meditate?
* How long should I meditate for?
* Is there an iPhone app or website I can access on my laptop for guided meditation?

Any help is very much appreciated."

lucagee__	2021-04-28 21:50:13+00:00	Meditation courses stripped off of spiritualism	"Hello,
I've been doing meditation for a while now specifically for optimising performance, relax and increase the overall health of my brain.

Lately I've been liking guided meditation, but I often found courses to be filled with the spiritualistic stuff which annoy me at best.

Is there anywhere where I could practice daily guided meditation without its attachment to spiritualism?"

Just looking for some advice- I've done yoga a few times and have never really been able to fully get into it. I had a friend recommend meditation to me but I honestly don't really understand the difference/ how in the world I get myself to calm my mind for long enough to reap the benefits.

Agapee-	2021-04-28 20:46:17+00:00	Anyone relate or explain	"When i meditate and do the usual take the breath all the way in and hold it at the end or at some point. I get a numbing feeling and lightheaded feeling but not a bad one , kind of like a blissful moment. My ego washes away and in the moment able to see clearly while my eyes are closed. But sometimes when it does happen, i get a fear in me and things start to expose upfront like , my decisions ive made, the oath im going to, am i going to the right path. All in that split second. Idk if anyone else as experienced this"
xpege	2021-04-28 20:31:07+00:00	Question about mindfulness	Hey guys! I am pretty new to meditation but today during my mindfulness practise while concentrating on the breathe touching my nostrils after like 10 minutes I felt like my breathe just slowed down and then I couldn’t feel it at all anymore. I continued for like 3-4 minutes after that but I wasn’t sure what I would concentrate on anymore. So I am asking is this a good thing and development on my practise or is it a dead end and I should change something on my practise? Thank you for all in advance!❤️
F1337wood	2021-04-28 20:28:14+00:00	Would like to share an experience I had today in hopes that it may help others have a similar experience.	"To start with, I've been meditating for a few years, but not with enough regularity, say a couple times a week for 10 or 15 minutes. You know, enough to say I'm meditating, but not enough to actually get any benefits. 


For the last couple months I've committed my self to meditating more regularly in hopes of reaching some form of higher consciousness and seeing some results in my daily life. I'm still not great about doing it every day, but 5 or 6 days per week vs 2 or 3 has felt like a big difference for me. When on the cushion, I still experience a lot of mind wandering from the breath, but off the cushion I have noticed a huge improvement in my attitude. Life is pretty stressful for me right now, but even still I find my overactive adhd mind that has driven me to so much anxiety in the past now finds the positive aspects of my life much more attractive. I still dwell on negative stuff from time to time obviously, but its like my mind is more buoyant, so even when heavy thoughts come, I find it much easier to rise through them, instead of letting them weigh me down.


This morning I was reading some about Pranayama, a practice of yoga I'd heard mentioned before but never knew anything about, and came across a description of the breath in Ujjayi Pranayama that seemed interesting. It described creating a pocket of air in the back of the throat like you are about to whisper a secret, while breathing through the nose. I found this a fascinating description, found it relatively easy to do, and sat down to try focusing on this more involved kind of breathing. The results were slow at first, but after a few minutes I found myself snoring. I realized then this was the same kind of breathing I must do when I sleep, and by being mindful of how I shaped the air in the back of my throat, I could continue this kind of whisper breathing without my usual fog horn snoring. While doing this I was not distracted by needing to swallow or sneeze or yawn as is usual for me; it felt like my body all on its own settled into the rhythmic breathing of sleep that never needs to sneeze or swallow, and for the first time, I think I felt my mind resting. 


Fully concentrated on maintaining this feeling in the breath, I meditated for 40 minutes barely realizing how much time had passed. Time finally seemed to slip from my awareness, and there was only the breath. I decided to open my eyes after what felt like just a few more minutes, and since then I still feel a little more present and aware of myself than I did this morning.


Here is the link to the article if anyone is interested:

Hope this can help someone else have the same breakthrough feeling on the cushion that I got today. Peace to you all, and good luck on your journey."
CrazyCale22	2021-04-28 20:05:45+00:00	How much can you learn from books before you need a teacher?	I’ve read many of the most acclaimed books on meditation and several books on Buddhism trying to piece together right understanding. Mostly my lack of progress has to do with a lack of consistency but assuming I got that in order would I need a personal guide before I can experience a moderate depth in my practice?
13asky	2021-04-28 19:30:04+00:00	Senses are your primary enemies when it comes to focus and meditation	"In vedas and sanatana dharma the key to achieving self control or ensuring your mind and heart are aligning which opens the kundalini energy of your chakras and always helping you to be self conscious and self aware. The way that most of the kids that were trained from childhood is through gurukul or staying at guru(teachers house) and learning everything by giving up their self of ego and identity and mastery over all the senses. A man who has truly understood how to control his senses and can see through all the facade can see through his mano netra (the vision that is projected when we close our eyes) or the third eye. Now how can senses cheat you ? 

The senses are designed to intake information as per their duty (dharma) the eyes see, the nose smells, the ears listen, the tongue tastes and the skin feels a touch. All these senses cannot be controlled except for eyes and hence we can always close our eyes or divert our vision away as soon as we see something unpleasant or something which we did not want to see. Now filtering this information is what the brain does and each sense can trigger specific emotion. These emotions can spiral thoughts into either desire or anger. Now desire has multiple layers and anger is caused by unfulfilled desire.
For someone starting to understand how to meditate as soon as you start closing your eyes you could realize the mind is still projecting visuals near your third eye chakra. First question the thought and categorize it with your sense i.e is this projection something that I saw or heard or listened, then understand the trigger points of such projections and try to get a better understanding of what exactly is diverting you from concentrating on your self. The deeper understanding you have of your trigger points the more aware you become, the more aware you are the more conscious you become thus becoming unlocking the potential. However all these are just the beginning there is more to this... feel free to correct me, or share your thoughts if this is genuine I would like to write more. I am trying to use this controlling of energy to a greater manifestation."

I am very open-minded. I love the mediation and astral projection communities. I get deep into literature and I love reading about everyone's experience, suggestions, and the like! 


I just watch all 3 parts of the documentary UNACKNOWLEDGED. The most recent one, the 2020 release is HIGHLY relatable to this sub, with a core focus on meditation and consciousness. 

I am curious to know if any of you have seen the documentary and what your thoughts are on the information delivered there around meditation and consciousness. How frickin cool!"

The first time I heard this statement, I thought it was an overstatement meant to glorify meditation. That being said, after many years of experiment and practice, I have to agree with those words. Meditation is really something that will change your life for the better. Not only that, it will also be beneficial to the people around you, and, also, the world at large."

NicPizzaLatte	2021-04-28 16:49:20+00:00	I'm taking up meditation again and want to focus on Vipassana meditation. Any recommendations for a book that can give me a growth path for gaining insight?	"Hi everyone, a few years ago I was meditating several times a week, with a focus on relieving stress and anxiety. I was usually (but not always) using guided meditations for about 15 - 30 minutes and doing it about 4 times a week. I felt like I was definitely getting benefits for what I was doing. I was clearly feeling less stressed and anxious but I wasn't getting any of the insight benefits that I hear can happen if you really focus on that. 

I'd like to start meditating again with the goal of gaining insight. I'm aware that I'll need to do things differently and give more effort, but not sure exactly how to go about it. I am interested in preparing for a retreat at some point in the future when that becomes the logical next step. Is there some book that can help me to start on this path and give me guidance as I progress? (I saw that there was a thread with book recommendations, but there was no way for me to discern which books are relevant to what I want to achieve without researching all of them.

For context, this source is where I'm getting a lot of my information about Vipassana and insight. I don't know how trustworthy it is, so please correct any misassumptions I'm making.

Any other kinds of meditation that night be a better fit? Something that's calming, but doesn't require being present with traumatic emotions?"
saf4ri	2021-04-28 16:13:18+00:00	Mind wandering to bizarre thoughts that I can't remember after meditating	Hey y'all I'm relatively new to meditating and while I'm doing it my mind is randomly wandering to really bizarre thoughts that I can't remember after the session. It's almost like I'm dreaming but I'm fully awake. Is that normal? I do 3 sessions every day and each of them is 30 minutes.
nk127	2021-04-28 16:05:03+00:00	An idea that did not sound appealing or convincing proved to be very effective.	"I am an over thinker. More than over thinking what hurts me most is being too involved with thoughts with adrenaline. I imagine/create scenarios in my mind as if my world is crumbling and i have to be the savior with my talk.

I did a great meditative session today(Advanced:Mind by Michael Taft on Simple Habit). The session spoke about mental images and mental chatter. It made me understand that what i suffer from is a mixture of both(moving images with mental chatter). The teacher explained very gently to how labeling them or calling them out will not make us engage with thoughts.

Though this form of meditation did not sound appealing, it proved to be effective. I had been trying different versions of meditation on this 14 day streak and this gave me the best tenderness and freshness. It gave me a way to undermine my unnecessarily heavy thoughts.

Why is it this good? Am i doing the other forms(focussing on breath or chakras) wrongly? Secondly - which state is better - a state of no thinking or a state of awareness of your thoughts? Please feel free to share any of your related observations."

Sometimes they are only auditory and sometimes they have a visual part to them. I don't see them like I see dreams. Its more like a vague mental image.

Sea_Cold301	2021-04-28 15:00:22+00:00	Anyone experience not sleeping due to meditation?	"I started meditating to fix sleep. It worked amazingly and I slept like a baby for 8 hours a night for a long time now. I've since plunged deeper into this non-duality state and I completely know I am not my thoughts or self, just the awareness of it all. It's been an intense adjustment. I find it's a shift I cannot reverse now. A few times now lately, I lay in bed and deep peace and euphoria surround me, and I do not sleep. I will lay there all night, and feel euphoric, but never actually fall asleep. The next day, like today, I sit here and feel this insanely deep peace after not sleeping at all, but my thinking mind is groggy, dull, I struggle with basic tasks. However when I close my eyes, I simply feel this deep, crystal clear peace again. I have young children, and a very demanding job. I have no clue what to make of this. My thinking mind wishes to reverse it, and gets scared because I am in unchartered territory alone.  Laying in bed without sleeping and still feeling peaceful, is very disturbing to my old self and mind. I know I have kids to take care of, and cannot afford to live in the mountains alone! Has this happened to anyone?"
shubrownie	2021-04-28 14:55:50+00:00	Setting aside time to explore Pain and Anguish within your practice	"3 weeks ago, I was having a really tough time meditating. Over the course of a few  sessions, I experienced lot of difficulties focusing on my breathing, it felt like my mind was racing more than usual and at a faster pace. I kept having repetitive thoughts and was unable to get settled.

Given that I was not making any progress on the breathing component, I decided to go explore the what was actually going on. I believe that my subconscious was trying to tell me something but I was not able to decipher it, which is why I was experiencing the mental discomfort.

These are the steps I took to further understand what was going on.

* I first tried to label the feeling. Was it sadness? Loneliness? Anxiety? Anger? Was it a combination of different feelings?

* Once I was able to determine how I felt, I tried try to get to the root cause of the issue. I went back in my memory to previous interactions with others, my previous thought processes, my childhood interactions with my parents.

* When I was satisfied with what I thought was the root cause of my issues, I told myself “These things happen in life, it has happened already, try to accept it”

At every step, I would continue to converse with myself until I was able to feel “yes this is it” and it felt like it was the right answer. For a lack of a better term, I felt the answer. It was a physical feeling of release. Eventually I had a feeling of looseness and when I went back to my breathing, I was able to focus much easier.

What I have described above very similar to yoga, when the instructor tells you to mentally key in on the area of tightness as a way to release it.

Let me know your thoughts on this"
Astral-foundations	2021-04-28 14:50:05+00:00	Does anyone else feel like meditation makes them less angry?	"I've struggled with anger for a long time and am very good at thinking myself into a bad mood, sifting through my resentments, often lasting the rest of the day. A lot of the time I'll excessively clench my jaw, and let my emotions over things that happened months or years ago affect my schoolwork, relationships, and enjoyment of normal life activities.

I started meditating about 5 years ago and have been pretty on and off in that time. When Covid started I decided I wanted to really take it seriously and do it as much as possible. I currently do it most days. I've noticed this past year that in phases when I'm regularly doing it, the angry days don't happen nearly as much. Sometimes life happens and I don't do it for a week or so, or do it infrequently for a period of time, and notice the intrusive thoughts come more, and are harder to shove off. 

Any of you guys experience this?"
5gtpepper	2021-04-28 13:56:07+00:00	Ego death?	"About a fortnight ago I started to meditate almost daily, and for the first time something different than just me watching my breath happened. Firstly, the only difference this time related to previous ones was that I put my alarm to beep after 13 minutes, and not the usual 10. Okay, so after the first 10 minutes I had the sensation of making backflips repeatedly, and the speed was increasing constantly. After a while it got so fast that I couldn't tell how fast it was anymore, and here's when it happened: there was no longer a rotation, neither had I a body to feel it; for some seconds it was very clear to me that I've become a single head, and then it just disappeared. After this the alarm beeped. 

The same sensation here (sensation of movement followed by lost of self conciousness) was described by Michael Stevens on the Mind Field's episode in which he tries ayahuasca, and the ego death is mentioned as one of the psychedelic effects. Do you guys think I had some sort of ego death or it's just the normal meditation effect?"
mpspenguin	2021-04-28 13:49:48+00:00	Uncomfortable with peace?	"I've had a few experiences, both while meditating and on psychedelics, where my mind went so still that only awareness remained. And from everything I've studied, that's kinda the goal (or at least a good sign of progress), yet every time it's happened I've had this knee jerk recoil reaction, where my ego kicks in and this overwhelming sadness rushes in.   


It's not a typical sadness about something pertaining to me, but rather a deep, impersonal sorrow, like a ""oh, this is how it is"". Like Ive seen a glimpse of reality and I'm disappointed by it, because I still want something more, something concrete to cling to. Then my mind starts racing about how nothing will ever be good enough for me- and I wonder if it's even possible to separate myself from that underlying hunger that seems to drive existence. It feels like the universe is insatiable, and it scares me.

I know there's a good chance I'm just projecting my own issues. I have PTSD and thanatophobia (fear of death), so I've been in fight or flight most of my life. It's just discouraging that even when I do manage to stumble upon peace, I cant seem to stomach it. It sort of feels like I'm giving up somehow, and that thats a dangerous thing to do. There's a surrender that happens that I always pull away from. I don't want peace; I want euphoria, and I'm scared that's gonna ruin my life.

Has anyone had experience with this sort of block? I feel like my anxiety is just so adaptable that it'll ruin anything these days, no matter how good I have it."
lezorte	2021-04-28 13:29:34+00:00	Some questions about staying conscious while falling asleep during meditation	"So to start out with a little bit of background: I've been practicing getting myself into a very deep state of relaxation in a relatively short period of time while meditating and have found a lot of success with it. I had an experience this morning where I was doing just that and noticed a very strange thing happening. I felt myself being aware of the fact that I started dreaming and I was able to stop the dream and switch back to a state of raw conscious awareness (not sure if I'm using that term right but basically I was back to having no thoughts and just feeling aware of my existence). And this repeated probably 10 times where I would feel my mind start dreaming again and I would immediately choose to switch back to conscious awareness. So I'm wondering if there are other people who are more experienced with this phenomenon and could maybe explain what exactly is going on and if this is something that unlocks new possibilities in new meditation. For example:  


* Was I actually asleep and conscious during it or was I just consciously waking myself back up each time I found myself dreaming?
* Is this even a healthy/safe thing to do to the brain or could I accidentally turn myself into an insomniac if I keep doing this?
* If this is safe, can it be ""mastered"" in order to allow myself to sleep and meditate at the same time for long periods of time? Would there be a benefit to that?
* Are there techniques that, when added to this, can be used to induce things like lucid dreaming or even astral projection (if you believe in that)

So I tried meditation for the first time this morning - a 12 minute session of just breathing in and out, basically - having been interested in trying it for a while. Thought 'why are you putting it off', and kinda just went for it eventually.

My expectations were it'd put me in a state of calm, and then likely boredom, and for the first at a guess 6 or 7 minutes it was sorta like this. I remembered to put a book in my bag before work, and I was aware of my head feeling a little funny but nothing too wild.

What I didn't expect was the anxiety that rushed in. A really silly thing popped up - 'what if my alarm doesn't go off' - which became really, really horrible at one point despite it being really quite nominal. I tried to appreciate what it was that I was feeling, but then the alarm went off and I had to get on with my day.

I don't even think I'd describe the experience as pleasant, but I'd definitely say it warrants further investigation. Thanks for reading  my brain dump :\]"

sakshi-niranjan	2021-04-28 05:11:55+00:00	The eye as an output device	"Perhaps I'm re-stating the obvious, but please bear with me.

The eye is well known as an input device, a biological camera that is able to capture the frequency and wavelength (ie., color and brightness) of light falling on it, and convert it to an electric signal that is supplied to the brain.

Literature also mentions that the eye is a mirror of the mind and that it can reflect emotions (such as peace, anger, or desire). Even when the eye is closed, it can expose the state of the mind. Thus, during REM sleep, the rapid eye movements are a consequence of thoughts/dreams/mental activity in sleep. In these states, the eye becomes an output device providing measurable information on the state of the mind to the outside world.

Consequently, for the meditator, eyes appear to be good indicators of the stillness of the mind. If your eye is steady and unwavering, then your mind is still, and vice versa."

Psyzhran2357	2021-04-28 04:09:39+00:00	Questions about sitting on a Zafu	"1. I recently got a zafu, and when looking at pictures of how to use it, most of them have their bottom resting on the cushion and their legs on the floor or on a zabuton. However, I've also seen some pictures of people sitting with their entire body on the cushion, particularly on the Amazon product page where I got mine. Obviously there's no one true way to sit on the cushion, but I'm wondering if there's any benefits having your legs on the cushion rather than on the floor?
2. My right foot points out to the side when my legs are facing forward; I'm worried it might be external tibial torsion. I usually sit in Burmese posture when I'm meditating, but since my right foot out-toes, I end up feeling a lot of pressure on my ankle if I sit in Burmese style for extended periods of time, no matter if my right foot is on the outside or the inside. However, the cushion is just wide enough that kneeling on in seiza it feels awkward, my hip flexors are too tight for me to perform full lotus, and sitting cross legged normally puts too much pressure on my bottom shin and ankle. Right now I'm trying to see if I can get myself comfortable with half-lotus on the zafu, but if you people have any suggestions for how to deal with my out-toeing right foot that would be great, as I find Burmese easier to maintain than half-lotus.
3. Typically when meditating, I have my hands either on my lap in the Dhyana mudra, or grabbing my knees. However, when sitting on the zafu, it raises my body up to the point that my knees are just out of reach. I can still rest my hands in the Dhyana mudra, but when sitting in Burmese posture, pretty much the only thing supporting my hands are my ""man parts"", so it feels unstable. Half-lotus is steadier, as I can rest my hands in the Dhyana mudra on my top foot, but my knees are still too far away for me to grab. What are some common places to put your hands if your zafu is just a little bit too tall for you?"

shadylimbo	2021-04-28 01:18:30+00:00	"I think I had my first meditative experience, and right now my mind is completely calm for the first time in years. How do I replicate this feeling?"	"So, some backstory. I have severe anxiety. Like, I have trouble leaving my room or dealing with stressful situations without having panic attacks.  Hell, I have trouble not keeping my mind constantly occupied. And I had tried meditating before to ease that, but like, I guess you could say my mind was too loud? It was too intense to be able to stick with it. So I gave up.

Now, to what’s actually important.
Right now, it’s raining outside. I live in a very dry, desert climate, so rain is a very rare thing. So, I decided to sit down on my porch, and watch the rain for a bit.

As I was watching the rain, I decided to close my eyes and just listen to the rain.

Basically the second my eyes were closed, everything became silent, and the earth became still. It was almost like I felt nothing at all. The only thing I could really feel was my own body, sitting in the chair, and I felt like a statue. Sometimes I could feel the wind, but that was it.

When this happened, it almost felt like my mind went into repair mode. I was thinking of the things currently bothering me in life, and it was almost like I was asking and answering my own questions, like an inner dialogue. I also was encouraging myself to get better, and to heal what was causing me to shut myself off from the world like I do. I can already say, I just experienced one of the most profound moments of my entire life. Looking back, it was intense. But during, it felt like nothing was happening at all.

Once I sort of came to, 30 whole minutes had passed, the rain was coming down extremely hard, and I was soaking wet lol. It only felt like seconds, however.

I’m sorry for that almost unreadable text.

But, was that meditation? And if so, how do I capture that again?"

When I engage in sitting meditation, the mind also frequently strays away in order to make future plans. If these were just typical plans, I would simply acknowledge the planning mind and then gently bring my attention back to the breath. However, I seem to come up with excellent plans while I meditate? It’s not even when I’m being mindful of the plans, it’s just when my mind is lost in the story of the plan. Yet, so often the plans I come up with while sitting are so good that I have to pause my meditation session (or ignore the breath) and continue indulging the plan. What do I do about this? I love that I’m randomly coming up with good plans for my future, but it SERIOUSLY distracts me from meditating and therefore hinders my progress!

A few weeks back I noticed I was feeling anxiety and when I inquired into it while meditating I found a subtle (but significant) feeling of shame.

I've also found this pattern in clients who suffer from anxiety.  Of course not all anxiety is repressed shame, but it was more common than I had realized.

"[Neville Goddard](https://youtu.be/fKNcfpLRhJA) says; If an imaginal act produces an external fact to support it, then is not this world essentially imagined? If you dare to assume what your reason and senses deny and walk faithful to your assumption, believing in its reality - and its corresponding effect is produced, can this seemingly solid, real-world be anything other than imaginal? Everything is imagined, for you are God - all imagination! God exists in you and you in Him. You cannot feed the mind violence and not expect violence in the world."

Even this realisation is a thought.

So who is the one that knows these thoughts? Who is the one that knows you are meditating?

Try exploring and finding the one who is meditating. 

If you are aware of sensation, thought, feeling or perception are you that even though these come and go many times throughout the day and countless times throughout a life time?

Thebestshipis	2021-04-27 19:46:14+00:00	Every time I meditate I get a panic attack caused by noticing my breath. Has anyone else experienced this and worked through it?	"I have had an ongoing problem for *many* years where every time I notice my breathing I start to feel like I can't breath. I try my best to take controlled breaths in these moments because I know that hyperventilating just causes greater panic. I've gone to a doctor about this in case it was caused by something medical but it was confirmed to be just anxiety. 

I also struggle with being far too reactive and feeling overpowered by my thoughts and emotions. I believe that meditation would be a great help if I could actually do it. But every time I sit down to do it I make it about 5 minutes before having a panic attack. I once tried to work through it and did a meditation once a day for a week, but the panic attacks didn't get better so I stopped. I have tried anchoring myself with my breath (to make peace with it), with my body, with guided meditations...nothing seems to work. Whenever I anchor myself with something else I still seem to get fixated on my breathing. I get a panic attack and start crying, as silly as this sounds, from fear since my body feels like it's being suffocated. It often takes me about 10 minutes to recover. 

Has anyone been through this? Is there light at the end of this tunnel? I have no idea how to work through this and I would love to be able to just sit with myself without feeling like I'm dying. Thank you in advance for any advice that may be given, or to anyone who just wants to share their experience."
SasquatchMini	2021-04-27 19:39:03+00:00	Is the ongoing mental narration of thoughts and external stimuli while meditating typical?	"I've been practicing for a little over a month, and I'm feeling kind of stuck.

During practice I feel that I am able to remove myself from being caught in the river of thought and can watch stray thoughts come and go without judgement, or chasing a train of thought. I typically watch my breath or become hyper aware of the sensations and sounds in my environment instead.

The problem I'm having is that there's an ongoing narration in my mind, and I'm not sure if this is a regular part of mediation that everyone experiences, or if I'm distracting myself from the practice unintentionally. 

For example, I am constantly counting my breaths, labeling things I hear/feel around me (""the clouds have shifted because I feel warmer, there's a bird in that tree chirping, my dog is snoring, I hear someone mowing their lawn"")

It seems like internal narration is something everyone has. If it's not, then how do you bring your attention back to just watching thoughts instead of chasing them? I don't really see many people talking about what their inner voice is doing as they meditate and I wonder if I've been doing it wrong this whole time."

Today’s been an interesting day so far. My cable’s out. No WiFi and I’m running off my phone’s hotspot. I’ve been banned from Twitter for 6 days for violating some rule and they have yet to explain to me after several emails. So I’ve spent the day in the apartment with two dogs, my roommate’s Alex a 4 year old Fox Terrier (she’s a girl) and mine, Eltro a 7 month old Bull Terrier (a boy) just listening to music with the windows open. Sounds from outside drifting in. Eating my no moo yogurt with berries and kashi berry crumble cereal mixed in. Thinking about what to make for dinner. Slowly texting my mom. Probably going to go cancel my membership to my favorite charity: the gym. Need to change the battery on my scooter, that should take some time. It’s just nice that there’s absolutely no rush today. No WiFi and being banned forced me to turn inwards... which was needed. It’s like the universe said, “Let’s pump the breaks a bit. Pull over and enjoy the view.” Sometimes you don’t know what you need till you need it. Till you’re forced to look at yourself. I’ll always take some good introspection. Anyway, just thought I’d share my low key quasi boring day. If you read all this, I hope I didn’t make you sleepy... cause I got tired just writing it. =P. Have a great day and stay safe!"

I didn’t go to school today because 1. I woke up late and 2. I just needed my me time. I was mad because I stayed home to relax and I felt like I never relaxed. I woke up at 11 and relaxed for about 40 minutes then I did my usual morning routine, did my laundry, did school work, and little did I know it was 2:45 and I usually get ready at 3. I spent 5 minutes freaking out and 10 minutes meditating. I was listening to a meditation about just being stress free. In the meditation it was talking about releasing stress. The sky went dark, I was crying, and I heard a ringing in my ear. Then it was talking about bringing it brightness the sky went bright and I was relaxed. Does the sky changing brightness while this went on have to do with anything? Is it all a coincidence? Any help?"

Last night I woke up a few times but overall got 6-7 hours of sleep. Today I had a break at work and decided to play a full moon sound bath on YouTube while I meditated. 10 minutes in and my head dropped startling me. 

I almost fell asleep. 

I tried it again. This time 15 minutes in and then my head dropped.

The 5, 10 or 20 minutes of time you commit to meditation in the morning will likely cause you to be significantly more productive throughout the rest of your day.  What is 5min out of your morning if you're getting an extra hour or more work done than if you hadn't meditated that morning?
2. How much of your day do you waste browsing the internet, watching TV, scrolling social media, etc?  Most of us spend HOURS every day in front of a screen.  What are you really sacrificing if you commit 20min or even an hour+ of mediation every day?"

RightHoJeeves	2021-04-27 15:36:46+00:00	Losing the self in meditation?	"I feel like I'm getting ""somewhere"" in my meditation (20 minutes a day for the past 60 days or so, using the Waking Up app) where the feeling of me-ness or having a self fades away and there is only that-ness, which appears to me as all the objects within the field of my consciousness (my visual field and the constant light show there, sounds, sensations, thoughts, etc). 

The objects are arising and I'm aware of them, but for brief periods of time the ""me"" that feels it's perceiving fades away and there is only the perception itself.

It feels very peaceful, but not happy or joyful or loving. It feels empty but not sad. I've read about others having some kind of peak experience in meditation (samadhi or something like it) and I've read it can feel ecstatic or mystical for some people. 

Am I meditating correctly? Does anyone else have this experience? Is this the ""point"" or meditation?"
mass8790	2021-04-27 15:11:53+00:00	Meditation Excerpt	"The Voice of Babaji

Chapter XI of “The Voice of Babaji—A Trilogy on Kriya Yoga,” by V.T. Neelakantan, S.A.A. Ramaiah, Babaji Nagaraj. 

        The first paragraph on page 211 clearly shows how the One plane allows for freedom. In a single frame, every aspect is whole. 

       Through the seeming conflict of the of the world, there is a plane which every one is in.  “The light shineth in the darkness and the darkness understandeth it not,” or close to the quote (don’t remember exactly).  Suffice it to say, the darkness is a mere shadow of Light, with seeming consciousness.  

       Yet, just as a shadow moves in reference to an object in the sun, it is not separate.  The plane is all encompassing.  For this reason, it is a privilege to be in.  To leave is to change the delegation of Love and alter the character of a person.  For this reason, it is not a responsibility or a privilege to communicate with darkness, for in being darkness It has complete dictatorship of what vibration it is in, seemingly.  

       To communicate Light to Light is the method, for it is the only thing which is True. If apparent darkness is there, see it only in reference to Light, for that what the apparent darkness is.  God is all; “Aum Kriya Babaji Namaha, Satguru deva Namaste, Satguru deva dayakapara, satguru deva kshama.”  

       God is all—Do not give the darkness the privilege of your precious love. The God is all—their mere vibration should be seen as such. Allow the never-ending clarity of Light to be the in residence, do not listen or take queues from darkness, for it is acting in a single  vibration,  not clarity, which is synonymous and the same as Light."
Roseraiin	2021-04-27 14:48:39+00:00	Why do we meditate for others?	"After using meditation guide apps, and videos. I’ve noticed that meditation at the start is for yourself, so you can improve your life, and be calm and reflective of your emotions and move forward with them. But I’ve noticed that when using guided meditations, the teachers usually say something along the lines of, “how can taking this time for yourself improve the life of others around you,” and I’ve contemplated it’s meaning for a while, but I’m still struggling to understand it. 

My take is that by being reflective of your mind, and embracing your emotions, you gain the ability to do so for others. To be compassionate for what they feel, and understanding that they’re people too with their own emotions and thoughts. By embracing your emotions and understanding them, you can be more understanding of others as well, but I’m curious to what you guys think? 
 
I’ve looked around online, but most questions are for oneself. Like, “why should I mediate, how can I mediate, why do you mediate?” with the premise always being oneself. Not saying that is wrong by any means, but I’ve haven’t come across anything regarding others. Either way, I appreciate the read! Thanks!"
penelopedelmar	2021-04-27 14:31:37+00:00	Shifting object of focus?	"Hi everyone, 

I've been practicing mindfulness meditation somewhat consistently for about a year now - typically 10-20 minutes a day and a few times where I've down 45+ mins. 

I realize I need to do longer sessions because I struggle with aspects of life that require insurance. 

One thing I noticed yesterday in one of my long sessions is that my focus on attention shifts from the breath to sounds, to sensations in my body. It doesn't like to stay on one point of focus the whole time. 

I think I have more thoughts than the average person running through my head at all times based on my ADHD so when I'm noticing my body/breath or any sensation that alone was an accomplishment.

Do you have any suggestions on how I can keep it on one object the whole time? Should I be shifting from mindfulness-based meditation to mantra-based? 

***TL;DR: My mind loves to shift from one object on concentration to the next in longer sessions of mindfullness-based meditation. Any tips on how I can work on keeping it to one? It is important to me in my life to get a handle on shifting my attention from one thing to another.***"

Started meditating in 2019 after awakening. Vibration raised naturally and ascension symptoms began to take place. I managed to heal some of my past negative emotions.

Here's where the problem is: I've reached a plateau with my healing. I'm being called by my intuition to heal my unprocessed emotions, and I am aware they're present, but every time I sit down to meditate on them, I literally can't feel into the emotion.

This has been ridiculously effing frustrating for me. Throughout the day, for example, I'll feel the emotion's presence in my body. So then, I'll sit down to try and be present with it, but I dont know how to fully feel the emotion and be present with it. Anyone have any help?

TLDR: Need help being present with my emotions and feeling into them."

I've recently gotten back to meditating after many years of absence. It's been about two weeks of practicing mindfulness meditation. In truth, I have a lot of negative thoughts and emotions. Emptiness is a major part of my experience and always has been. I had forgotten how absolutely essential mindfulness is to switch off of this thinking.

I digress. One thing I've noticed recently is that at points during meditation I may start to notice negative emotions and thoughts coming up. One technique I find useful in probing these things is asking myself ""Is this true?"" Not always but at times I feel a shift into my heart and start laughing. Not out loud chest laughing but deep, short, and quick belly laughs through the nostrils. It feels good but foreign. I am not sure why I'm laughing.

Is there any advice that can be given to help understand or investigate deeper the core of this feeling?

Knowing our issues is not the same as healing our
issues. In fact, knowing is often a willful act, entirely
incongruent with the experience of surrender required
to heal. I have known many who could name their
patterns and issues—almost like they had done a
science experiment on their own consciousness-
but nothing changed because they refused to come
back down into their bodies and move their feelings
through to transformation. It's safe up there, above
the fray, witnessing the pain-body without actually
engaging it. The key to the transformation of
challenging patterns and wounds is to heal them from
the inside out. Not to analyze them, not to watch them
like an astronomer staring at a faraway planet through
a telescope, but to jump right into the heart of them,
encouraging their expression and release, stitching
them into new possibilities with the thread of love.
You want to become a holy patchwork? Heal your
heart.

For the deepest meditation, you must not only have the ability to focus your consciousness completely on one object, you must also have the ability to make awareness itself be that object (the one you're going to focus on).

In the highest state, the focus of consciousness is turned back to the self.

usernamesarehard-__-	2021-04-27 02:18:11+00:00	Need a simple exercise for calming down	"Hello there,

I would like to preface this post with me saying that I suffer from generalized anxiety and addiction which I got to therapy for (I'm not sure what all I can and can't say on the sub, but I'll say it's a digital addiction.) 

I'm not looking for relationship advice, but just as background, I'm the jealous type. All of my relationships have been online except for one, and most have ended with the girlfriend cheating or causing some unhealed wounds. My most recent relationship ended weirdly, and I thought she was a catfish towards the end. Long story short, I'm having a hard time with addiction and went back to talking with her.

She's definitely a gamer, but I have a lot of jealousy and insecurities that come up when I think about her talking to other people. I get really jealous when she choses to do other activities by herself or talk with her friends over me. I totally understand it's a me problem and, I want her to talk to friends. I just need some form of exercise I can do to not feel so anxious or jealous. Any suggestions?

Idk if this is relevant, but I'm a 19 year old male."

To be present would mean you're not in your emotions. No depression, anxiety, fears, etc. Not only in meditation, but believing in the law of attraction you don't want to give any energy to those kinds of thoughts or emotions, right? I even recall Joe Dispenza saying something similar to if you're living in the now there's no room for depression and anxiety.
At the same time you don't want to suppress emotions but instead really dive deep and explore them. 

So how do you do both? When do you do one or the other?
How can you be present but still feel the painful experience of something that has happened? 
(Doesn't have to be pain, just easiest to use in my example)"
RL_angel	2021-04-27 02:03:55+00:00	Mindfulness Meditation vs. Sudden Realization	"The pervading view in the meditation community is that in order to get to a place where your feel free and liberated, interconnected and present, as the norm, you must spend many years meditating to reach that point. 

But actually it's been my experience that it only takes many years when your practice is concentration-focused. For example the typical mindfulness meditation instruction, ""focus on your breath"", is telling the ""person"" - the web of thoughts, associations &amp; stories in the brain that we think is ""us"", to take on the task of finding the breath as an object and then keeping its focus on it while repeatedly moving that focus away from distractions. The person temporarily takes on another role - ""the meditator"". 

This isn't bad. It still reduces ruminating thought and calms the body, helping many people feel better. 

In non-dual pointing instructions however, ""The person"" is seen through completely within minutes, and no meditator role is created. Instead, there is a direct entry into **an unconditioned, encompassing Now** in which all experience flows seamlessly. 

Rather than an eyes-closed pointed focus on a single object (like the breath), the awareness is instantly expanded outside the constraints of any ""focuser"" or ""meditator"" perspective, into the vibrant spaciousness that all of experience is arising within, including the subtle energy of the body, and everything in the room and beyond. Think of the experience standing at the top of a mountain with a beautiful view, feeling infinitely wide open and connected to everything. Now take that same feeling, but simply sitting in your living room. 

Such instant recognition often comes paired with the rapid reprogramming of the brain in the form of spontaneous energetic release (instances of faster or deeper breathing, spontaneous stretching, trembling or contorting of the body, even vocalizations). 

In buddhism these are called piti, in Yogic traditions they are called kriyas. In my modern view, it's simply the body rapidly reversing and unraveling the various tensions from the old conditioning that was stored throughout in the nerves and muscles.

Some people experience small amounts of this energy-release with mindfulness meditation (there have been posts in this sub talking about it), which shows that they're seeing tiny glimpses of that unconditioned awareness. But nondual pointing instructions can give very ""wow""-inducing, big glimpses of it. And it's very transformative to the nervous system. 

Now you're probably wondering ""if it's so powerful why doesn't anyone know about it???"" Well the reason such instructions aren't so well known is because traditionally they have been kept secret, reserved for monks and serious meditation practitioners who have studied under particular teachers for years (in the places where mindfulness meditation was originally developed like Tibet). However there are some western teachers who were able to get the pointing instructions and now teach them to westerners who desire to be shown. 

I personally am not one of those teachers but I do have my favorites. They're all on Youtube:

Loch Kelly
Joan Tollifson
Alan Wallace
Eckhart Tolle
Rupert Spira

I personally find Loch Kelly to be by far the most clear, thorough and easy to follow without being too esoteric (his pointers are also on Sam Harris's app). Personally working with his particular instructions for a while, made the teachings of Eckhart Tolle and other more well known teachers resonate so much more, like I truly ""get it"" now. But the other teachers are also very good and some people may very well resonate more with them instead, perhaps the language certain teachers use clicks better for some than others. 

Anyway, I just wanted to offer this for anyone who's been doing mindfulness meditation for a while and would like to explore the next level of realization. Thanks for reading and have a joyful day. If anyone has nondual practice experience to share, or any questions, feel free."

BeizedBurnebn	2021-04-27 02:01:09+00:00	This 35-Minute Session Combines my Favorite parts of inner-world stuff	"Meditation, mental exercises, and law of attraction always seemed like this key to me living a less-stressed and more abundant life.

But I quickly found that these things can get lost in a messy web of sorts. Should I sit down to just be present and meditate? Should I sit here to work on mental focus exercises? Should I do some real law of attraction visualization and seeding practices? 

It all seemed like a lot.

Now, I've realized that I can kinda do whatever I want with my mind. So I decided to combine all these into a 35 minute session. It's not perfect, and of course it's hard when your mind slips... but sticking with this has lead to me being more calm, focused, and generally more vibrant and abundant.

I hope something along these lines can do the same for you :)

Here’s how my 35 minute meditation sessions have worked out thus far:

* 5 minutes of body presence. Scanning my body, paying attention to how it feels. Scanning it up with my inhales, and down with my exhales.
* 5 minutes of seeding and visualizing healed ears. I have tinnitus. Meditation has been proven to help tinnitus, and my mantras are helping me to get more excited over having silent ears.
* 5 minutes of seeding and visualizing myself going day-to-day in the PRESENT moment. Feeling focused on the present. Not lost in thought. If I get lost in thought, it’s okay. But for the most part, the idea is to be Zen.
* 5 minutes of seeding and visualizing me making my own money. “I make my own money, in my own way, with my own skills.” I visualize getting Stripe payments. Right now the goal is to make $1000 a month with my own personal endeavors. That’s just the start, and I’ll increase it from there.
* 5 minutes of seeding and visualizing me being *focused* and *decisive*. “I am focused. I am decisive.” I’m not game for being constantly distracted and multitasking and not really committing to a business idea or to one creative idea. So this is to seed that in my brain.
* 5 minutes of returning to the present moment with body scans. Like the first 5 minutes. I also try to feel stillness towards the very end. Where I just zone out and feel the energy in the room.

===

That's from my Medium account, which I started because in addition to doing this every day, I'm trying to publish either written stuff or video stuff every day. To get comfortable with finding my voice.

Meditation, mental exercises, and loa don't have to be these strict, anxiety-inducing things. That's counter-intuitive, which is kinda how our brains work sometimes. I've been stressed by those things before... but I find this exercise helps me find the sweet spot of what I'm looking for with the inner world. I hope it helps you too!"

At times I'll catch a thought or a response to something that picks at my insecurities and I'll think to myself "" is laughing some kind of defense mechanism I've been relying on?"" "" why do I find joy in the despair of people who have treated me wrong?"" ""why do I feel a stab of anxiety just at the thought of looking at my ex's social media?"" I started meditating as a way to battle my anxious attachments, be more focused and ultimately just be a better person.

dalda1	2021-04-26 22:55:26+00:00	Sharing my experience with meditation	"Hopefully I can motivate some people out there to start meditating by sharing my own experience and the huge benefits I’ve gained because of meditation.
(Excuse me for my English)

I (22M) started meditating one year ago after the Corona outbreak and I can honestly say that it was one of the best decisions of my life. I always knew there were scientifically proven benefits to meditation, but it was hard for me to start actually practicing it, because I knew no people who meditated and it didn’t seem like something you would do just out of the ordinary. Then this basketball documentary about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls came out (The Last Dance) and it showed me how many successful athletes use meditation consistently to boost their performance and mindset. I love sports and try to be ambitious myself and this showed me there is value in meditation.This triggered me to start my journey with meditation.

After I watched the documentary I started browsing on this reddit for tips to get started with meditation. I also watched some YouTube videos and read some books of Eckhart Tolle to learn more about being mindful and present. I wanted to use an app to meditate and I ended up with Headspace. I was disciplined and motivated enough to practice meditation daily and I started with an NBA guided mindset meditation. The first days it was really hard for me the keep my mind still and to concentrate on my thoughts. I didn’t feel like I was getting better at it and I didn’t feel any significant benefits. After about 10 days I started noticing I was better at keeping my mind still and distancing myself from my thoughts. I felt so relieved after each meditation and I felt even more relaxed and focussed at the same time. The 2nd and the 3th month I was meditating daily, for a longer time period (20 min) and more repetitions (2-3 times). My daily meditation routine literally caused me to feel like a different person after these months of practice. I became more focussed, happier, present, spontaneous, creative, social, productive, open-minded, flexible and the lists goed on and on. I have developed huge emotional intelligence because of meditation. I felt like I attracted more positive people towards me, more positive experiences and more joy. I felt more present and alive experiencing all of this than any i have ever felt in any other time period in my life. Another benefit was that my energy became unreal. I would have very active days with studying, working, fitness, practicing sports, reading books, socialize and still feel the energy to do more. This felt like the best, happiest and most alive time of my life. 

After this time period during winter there was a 2nd lockdown in my country because of the Corona pandemic. This caused to develop bad habits like gaming a lot, not working out, isolating myself etc. Eventually I had lost the discipline to meditate and I ended op not meditating at all. I had recognized that not meditating caused me to lose a lot of the benefits that I felt before and my life didn’t feel as lively as before. During February 2021 this year I had enough of not taking action against my bad habits and I started bettering myself again. After months of hard work I am back on track with all the good habits I had before and I am meditating daily for a few weeks now. I picked up on my meditation skills real quick and the results showed much faster than when I first started meditating. Today was the first time I felt so powerfully present and conscious again because of meditation and I know that I will succeed to become even more present from now on. 

I want everyone to know that these benefits of meditation are very real and to my opinion it is one of the best habits you can implement in your life. Hopefully my experience motivates you guys to educate yourself further about the subject or actually start or resume with meditation. It will be worth it!"

It's been a while since I've start think of meditating and every time I read about all of the positive effects it has and the awareness it can be gained I'm enthusiastic but then I start to overthink. I fear that even if I try to meditate I would never do it right and it would not have any kind of influence on me, so I never commit. Anyone had a similar situation? What helped you overcome this fear? Is it possible to fail meditation? Sometimes it is comforting to know that you have a tool that could help you feeling better, getting ride of the anxiety, killing the ego but than if you try to use it you risk to be find yourself incapable of manage it"

helpagirloutyall	2021-04-26 18:47:42+00:00	"I used to meditate a lot, but fell out of practice. Now I can’t meditate without immediately slipping into intense visualizations. Any input on this?"	"I learned transcendental meditation when I was about 18. I kept up with it until I was maybe 21, and then some personal things happened and I lost touch. I have always had intense visualizations, some of them quite disturbing. Once I was meditating in my apartment in college and I kept seeing these scary faces that felt like they were attaching themselves to me and my breathing got shallow. It felt like no matter what I did I couldn’t shake them off. After I had finished the meditation, and after some thought, I attributed it to the fact that things were extremely tense with one of my 2 roommates, and it was all of the stress and anxiety coming out. 

But this is something that happens often and it’s hard to get back into meditating. It feels like whatever is going on in my life comes out strongly in my meditations. I just got through meditating today and I couldn’t even focus because I was picturing this vine wrapping around my neck and constricting my breathing like those faces I saw in college. 

I know this isn’t some weird power I have and that I likely just have a lot of built up stress and anxiety that presents itself to me in these weird ways, but honestly meditating can be a point of greater point of stress than relief for me with these experiences. Even when I try to watch these thoughts like I’m on a lazy river, passing them by, it feels like they attach themselves to me and I can’t escape them. 


Does anyone else have these intense experiences when meditating?"
Curryqueen-NH	2021-04-26 18:30:18+00:00	Meditation as couples therapy?	"So I'm wondering if anyone has ever meditated as a couple and used the time immediately afterwards to connect with your partner? 

Up until recently my husband and I have used mushrooms a couple times a year to help us connect, and it's been very effective. However, due to an accidental overdosing issue a couple years ago, my anxiety while on them has reached a peak and I can't continue to do them. I'm hoping to look for another method of connecting that will be as effective.

If anyone has any insight, rituals, or recommendations for how this might work I'd really appreciate them.

For background, I'm a novice, don't meditate frequently but can definitely achieve an inner peace and am able to reflect properly when I take the time, usually when I'm at the beach enjoying the sounds of the waves.

Platyhelminthes88	2021-04-26 17:58:42+00:00	ADHD - trouble meditating	"Hello!

I've been attempting to meditate for many years. I have ADHD. The past 3 months, I've been attempting to meditate for 10-15m a day. Most weeks I end up only meditating 5 or 6 days, but it's been fairly consistent.

The method I've been following is ""sit cross legged, be aware of the breath, and when thoughts come up, just let them go and come back to the breath.""

The problem is, thoughts don't ""come up."" They're simply always there. I don't really have verbal thoughts. I don't ""talk to myself"" in my head in sentences, like ""oh I need to do laundry,"" or ""what should I make for dinner?"" Instead, my mind is mostly dominated by music going through my head. I always, always have music in my head, either actual music or just random stuff my brain is improvising. There are also images always floating around in my mind. My thoughts aren't entirely nonverbal - often I think about imaginary conversations, or conversations I had in the recent past. 

Basically, I'm always daydreaming, and those daydreams have a prominent soundtrack. All the meditation instructions I've read say ""when a thought comes up, let it go and return to the breath,"" but it's not like I have these discrete ""thoughts"" that pop up... it's just constant background noise.

To use an analogy: It's not as if I'm in an empty room and every now and then someone walks into the room and starts talking to me. It's more like I'm in a crowded bar, with music playing and conversations happening all around me. I feel like (keeping with the analogy) meditation instructions make it sound as if the goal is to deal with random people who pop into the room and start talking to you. But how do you deal with an entire crowded, noisy bar?

I've been trying this for a while, and it's always the same thing... Maybe 5% of the time I'll actually be able to keep my attention on the breath, but usually, the background noise - music, images, conversations, etc. - is just overwhelming. I feel like I'm playing tug of war against an entire football team. I finish meditating and feel like I was just daydreaming for 15 minutes, with very occasional moments of mindfulness. I've really been trying for months, with a fairly regular (almost daily) practice, every morning after my shower.

Any advice is appreciated. I know there are alternative types of meditation that I could try, and I will look into those, but I think I'm mostly interested in how to be successful at this particular style of meditation, if that's possible for me.

Thank you!"

Do you. Do whatever works for you in the moment. Practice takes time. It is progress that matters.

I’m not perfect at my practice. I’m new here too and maybe I don’t have the credential to post this as much as the people who’ve been doing this for years but the past couple of months I’ve been attempting to do this have already made so much difference in how I handle the things in my life.

So I started drinking green tea before doing meditation. It helped and that's how I have continued doing this.
But recently the same feeling is back and the tea is of no help.

So I stopped doing it completely for a week. I have retained a lot of good qualities from years of meditation. I am still focusing great, feeling calm and etc. 
Also I am not getting that sleepy feeling anymore, saves a good productive hour per day.

Should I just stop meditating untill I start feeling the need or try something like dynamic meditation, eg: walking meditation? Or maybe do some sessions on weekends?"

It doesn't help that these thoughts are then vindicated when I find myself behind on things.

I've heard great things about what meditation can do for Anxiety but I just can't seem to stop my brain going 100mph CONSTANTLY and the evil side of my mind telling me that it's a bad idea to just focus on the present when you've got so much to worry about.

ConfusedTriceratops	2021-04-26 14:19:25+00:00	Meditation posture	"Hello.   
I've been trying guided meditations now (3-4 weeks of daily meditation 10-15mins) for a while and wanted to start my own practice in either silence or with some calming sounds.   


I've got a huge issue with my position. So, the point is, in any place you read about meditation or in any guided meditation, it's said to be in a comfortable position. I usually slouch a lot and I spend most of my days just slouching, so I've decided I'd do laying down meditation. The thing is.. I've fallen asleep twice already by doing so and I'd rather avoid it, to work on my mindfulness.  


I've tried sitting meditation for a couple of times but I end up really frustrated. When I slouch I feel I can breathe easily, but when I sit straight up, as most of the people here and other sources advice, I can barely breathe. It's a really shallow breath and I can barely feel it. Not only I can barely feel it, but I do need to take deeper breaths intentionally as I feel I do not get enough oxygen then.   
It leads me to controlling the breath all the time.   


Not only that, but I'm all the time concerned (when sitting) about my position. My back does hurt after a while of sitting straight and I do not feel stable to the point that I get both irritated by controlling the breath, but also controlling my posture, as I naturally either lean forward or backwards, which adds tension to my abdomen and other parts like legs (sitting cross-legged), which leads to me to focusing on these parts to loosen, but then I slouch again &amp; get irritated.

I have a tendency to overthink so mediation was tough at first but I've getting better at focusing on the breath and just noticing the thoughts come in.  One thing I've noticed though is that midway through a session as my mind and body get more relaxed some very intriguing thoughts can pop into my awareness.  These are a lot harder to ignore than the usual regrets and worries about the past and future.  I'm getting better at simply noticing these intriguing thoughts as well but they do have a tendency to make me slip into thinking without realizing it.  My plan is to keep up with the practice and try to just notice the more creative and interesting thoughts that may arise during a session.  I was wondering if anyone has experienced similar things and what they've done about them?"

I normally start out by focusing on my breathing, and then maybe at the 5 minute mark, colors appear in my visual field (eyes closed). Typically purple. I read that these are likely the chakras that are being healed when you meditated, like how purple is the crown Chakra. I don’t know for sure if that’s what it is but I feel like it’s a solid assumption

Anyways so when these color show up they tend to swirl and just move around so my focus starts to be on that instead of my breathing. I honestly think it’s just as good as the breathing since I don’t tend to think to much when I’m watching them dance and this often gets me in to my trace state.

Does anyone else do this? I haven’t done deep research but I don’t think I’ve seen focus practices that mention color so I’m just curious!"

(I had just moved into my grandparents) as I got more into meditation I would fall into like a deep sleep and I would dream of my future sometimes. I could see my self and others but I couldn’t recognize any faces so I never really paid attention to them, except for mine. I eventually forgot about what I saw and it was just a dream until last summer. Last summer i had this most intense feeling of deja vu. I was remembering what I had seen in that state of sleep while meditating. It lasted about 15 minutes, just this continued feeling of the most intense deja vu. I almost didn’t know what to do because I was remembering this happy memory I couldn’t wait for to happen and then it was finally unfolding before my eyes. When I was younger I wanted to be in that moment of happiness so badly because I was in such a sad place. Then I was finally there, I was just in shock that I made it to the place I was safe and happy..... anyone else ever experience anything like this?"

Moon and mind are deeply connected. Practicing this meditation on a full moon day has many powerful benefits for the mind and body.   

🍀The full moon tends to mark a big build-up of energy—both light and dark. This makes it the perfect time to cleanse your space, body and mind; remove or let go of any of that built-up energy you no longer feel like harnessing, capturing or otherwise holding onto. You can use the mantra “let everything that doesn’t belong to me go”—even if just for tonight.   

🍀Many believe the light from the full moon is absolutely perfect for charging and cleansing your crystals. This makes some sense—the full moon is all about bringing our intentions and emotions to the forefront, so we can process them, heal what we need to and ultimately, let go.  

 🍀As you engage in self-reflection, you may notice patterns, behaviors or relationships that aren’t getting you any closer to the life you want. Maybe they’re even detracting from it. Use this full moon as a reminder to let them go—or at least, as an opportunity to contemplate why they’re still there. 

  🌟This Audio Lunar Meditation Includes: Theta Healing Waves, 111Hz music, 528hz, Kundalini Stimulation, 269Hz which corresponds to the Scorpio Zodiac Sign, 210.42HZ which is the frequency of the Moon.   

🌟This full moon will bring some passion to your life and intensity as well as intimacy.The full moon in Scorpio affects all zodiac signs, but Scorpio and Taurus will feel it the most.

lukefromdenver	2021-04-26 12:07:50+00:00	Returning to Flow: Turning the wheels of the chakras by intentional use of regional musculature	"It is important not to put too much pressure into the seeking energetically for the keyhole of the chakra. Using downward force is a dangerous option to use for energy control. The easiest method for accessing lower-region chakra flow is belly-breathing techniques.

One such technique is breathing very low in the abdomen. Feeling the sacral region just above the genitals, and in the area of the back just above the rump and below the lumbar, squeeze in at these areas as though feeling the ripeness of fruit, but do it only by the mind sending the signals to the musculature there. Then, like a bellows, take a breath in this same area by making it open up a space inside you, creating a vacuum filled by energy and air. Then relax and let the charged air exit naturally. 

Then repeat. Slight squeeze in, then expand out drawing air, then relax with an exhale. The slight squeeze in pushes out excess air to come to a total lack of internal air, but we don't want to force anything, we want our body to work with us; we are not trying to discipline it, but seek its participation. 

The same can be done at the lumbar and solar plexus. The upper abdomen muscles, just below the sternum, and the pair of lumbar muscles that display prominently beneath the heart-region, can be clenched, expanded, then relaxed to pump air in, and the particular energies produced by this chakra, combining with to to infuse into and circulate throughout the bloodstream. We're just using a complex machine to achieve physio-psychological balance; this machine must be used or it falls into disrepair, along with the mind. 

Moving back and forth between these two chakras, by pumping them, turning their wheels with continued and focused effort, after *rooting* has occurred (non-violently, and through body awareness brought about by yogic poses [*asana*] and exercise, if necessary) one should be able to produce a warm feeling throughout the abdomen that can be passed into the chest, where it can expand, strengthen, and grow the potency of the heart muscle: *the* pump.

The lower three chakras can be seen like a pyramid, where the square foundation is the base created by our seat, and the peak comes together at the solar plexus, above which sits the all-seeing eye of the heart. The goal is to get into the heart, which causes the emergence of light seen during meditation, and the flows of deep insight and reflection upon the Divine within. Jai gurudev."

Basically was relatively new to the group and never really ever ended up properly fitting in, which is ok, but now I'm stuck in a spot where coworkers are nice to my face but complain about me behind my back and it stings when I overhear it or it gets back to me. Meditation is something that helps a lot, but I find I fall into the trap of pushing down all this anger instead of acknowledging it and letting it pass. I want to not care as a way of petty vengeance rather than letting it go for my own sake at the moment. Also I find it a bit challenging to be professional despite having an idea of what someone really thinks of me. Anyone have any experience with this and how meditation helped them through it? :)"

Jax_Gatsby	2021-04-26 10:09:01+00:00	Be indifferent to the mind.	"One of the things (if not the only thing) that makes not just meditation but also life difficult is the mind, or rather identification with the mind. Attention is basically like food to the egoic mind , so the more attention you give it, the more control it has over your emotions, actions and even your behaviour. The mind is meant to be the servant but now it has become the master, this is why people are the way they are; because they are identified with their minds so most (if not all) of their actions and words come from this place of egoic dysfunction, hence so much conflict in relationships and so on.  The ego is by it's very nature selfish, all of it's action is self-centred. You can see this if you spend a day observing the mind, most of the thoughts that come into your mind are about you and what you have to gain or benefit from people and situations. Therefore anybody who is identified with their ego cannot really love, because the ego can't know what love is. It actually gets in the way of love.

So the key is to be indifferent to the mind. [Let go](https://open.spotify.com/track/6tECczt3HwfH9NtCEhOrYb?si=71c9511c808645ba) of the effort to control it and just let it say whatever it wants. This indifference creates a distance between you and your thoughts, which will also make it more clear that you're not your thoughts. Watch the thoughts in the same way you would watch a tv show you have no interest in, because the mind only keeps coming up because of our interest in what it's saying. If you stop giving it attention and showing interest and just watch it in an indifferent way, it will slowly bother you less and less. This is called [the art of watching.](https://open.spotify.com/track/4kuawcP3nvJYDlo6FNwjoO?si=8bd167fded634e45)"

RandomName12358	2021-04-26 10:00:53+00:00	How to stay calm and fall asleep at night with loud neighbors ?	"Hello,

I just started with meditation 2 months ago and I already feel much more relaxed during the day. 

But I still have problem with being relaxed at night when I want to fall asleep. I live in a noisy apartment and I constantly hear noises from the neighbor. It is not very loud but i can here them walk up and down or sometimes it sounds like they are moving furniture. As soon as i hear them i feel how i get restless inside and it feels like adrenalin builds up and my body gets in a fight or flight mode. The more I try to stay calm the more I focus on the noises from the neighbor. 

My biggest problem is that i also have Tinnitus, so i can't fokus on the noises in my head and i always have to focus on something outside my head. So i hear outside noise much louder. I always try to focus on my breething but as soon as i hear my neighbours i focus on their sounds. 

This is a very big problem because even when the sounds of my neighbors stop, my Tinnitus got activated and it is getting louder and louder and it is almost impossible to fall asleep then.

&amp;#x200B;

How can meditation help me to get this problem under control ?"
ScotGal22	2021-04-26 09:45:09+00:00	Anyone used acupressure may while meditating?	"Hi there, I have anxiety and panic disorder and my therapist recommended I try meditation. I’m still fairly new to meditation but I tend to use the Headspace app for guided meditations which are great.
Recently I purchased an acupressure mat online and I’ve been lying on that for 15 minutes while I meditate before/after a bath. I personally think it’s a game changer, it puts me in a deeper state of relaxation. At first it’s kind of uncomfortable and itchy but after 5 minutes it feels warm and relaxing. 
Just wondered if anyone else uses this? Or is it best to meditate while sitting up cross legged?"
Itsme66604	2021-04-26 08:25:48+00:00	My head started shaking violently and I felt something rise through my body and then I became god?	"I know it sounds crazy but hear me out as I’d like to hear your thoughts. During a very deep trance like meditation, I suddenly felt my head shaking violently from side to side. I then felt something make it’s way up through my body like a surge of energy. Then I saw a brilliant light, like a pure white light, not like sunlight but almost like heavenly white light that was pure all around me. My body was then surrounded by something that was a very deep violet purple, then my body started to disintegrate and my body transformed to what I can only describe as god. I looked like a Hindu god, you know those blue skinned gods in Hindu mythology? I looked like that and I saw some insane creative energy manifest with my own eyes. 

No one believes me but I know for a fact it happened because I’ve done it multiple times now. I’ve been trying to find online anything that’s similar but can’t find anything. When it occurs it feels ancient and sacred for some reason and I genuinely thought I became some sort of god like being. Can anyone explain what’s going on? I don’t mean visions, I mean literally see with my own eyes how the room I was in and my body disintegrated and my ‘body’ was replaced by like a blue god like energy I can’t explain it. I’ve been reading that it’s something to do with kundalini but there’s so much hocus pocus out there from new age culture that I havnt really looked into it."

I’ve been meditating pretty much every day for the past 2 months or so. It’s been really helpful and I enjoy it. 

I’m curious what type of meditations are out there and which of them you have found to be the most beneficial for really letting go and getting into the flow of energy (hope that makes sense) so as to deeper connect with the essence of yourself and perhaps source itself. Or to truly feel that sense of presence/power of now as Eckhart tolle puts it. 

At this point my go to is to just pop on some reiki music on YT and focus on my breathing and feeling energy moving through the different areas of my body / chakra system. Often times I’ll feel a pulsing/pressure in my third eye area (and most recently a pinpointed hotness - don’t know what that was?) anyways I’ve tried guided meditation, binaural beats, chant in my mind. 

What works best for you guys and any tips/resources that could be beneficial? 

Many thanks,

I'm obviously never going to get the apology I feel like I deserve. I'm never going to hear I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm never never going to get the conversation I need.

What does it mean?

What does all this mean?"
richard-romex	2021-04-26 03:10:59+00:00	"possible explanation for some of the ""crazy experiences""."	"I have always been an atheist(I still am). I'm a rationalist and only believe in science. I do not follow any religion. In fact I have made fun of religious people a lot in the past and have argued with them many times just because I was an asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started doing meditation about a year ago, I thought it would be just some stress reliever or something. But, it is way much more than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ""crazy experience"" or ""opening third eye"" or ""out of body experience"" are not really something out of this world or something that is way far from our normal experience. The fact that we exist in this moment is ""Magic"". The fact that you are able to read this sentence is ""Magic"". The fact that you have a body which is made up of several things(that we call organs) which allow you to see, touch, move and feel emotions like love, sadness, fear and happiness is ""Magic"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why everything feels too normal to us is because all of this mystery or magic is tiled over with concepts. We have this goggles that we call ego which takes away our power to see the things as they are. The sense of self, ego is product of thought. When you learn to cut through this sense of self, this sense of being in the body, you feel one with the universe. There is no you actually in those moments. There is just experience. There is just universe. There is just this body moving. There are sounds, other beings and you see that you are not in the universe, you are the universe. A lot of these ""out of body"" experiences does not mean there are 2 bodies, one is at ceiling and another is looking down at their another body like you see in movies.

&amp;#x200B;

And I completely understand this sounds crazy, nonsense, alien thing to average person and I honestly do not blame them. If about a year ago, someone had said this to me, I would have told them to go fuck themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying I'm special or unique but maybe not everyone can feel this oneness or maybe they are not willing to take spiritual practice seriously as some other people. One thing that I think is necessary is to keep your mind always open. Keeping your mind open helps you a lot in self-improvement and all other areas of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many people who decide to take psychedelics have this almost same mystical, crazy experience. They come away from these experiences knowing that normal consciousness hides several emotions from us. People also realize that their sense of self may not be accurate. They realize they may not exist the way that have always thought they did. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it is very hard to believe in these experiences unless one has experienced it through meditation or psychedelics themselves at least once. And I also understand some people over-exaggerates and claim to have weird experiences which does not have anything to do with meditation or spirituality. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot of mystical stuff that is real and legit and there is a lot of annoying hippy made-up nonsense stuff. Just because bad stuff is bad does not mean good stuff is not good if that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Love."

So far today, I’ve seen so many rude comments and judgmental posts, it’s starting to bum me out. Remember, meditation teaches us to let go, and not get stuck in our own neurotic thoughts and actions. Allow room for other opinions, and if it doesn’t serve you, move on.  
  
Love is the way. Compassion is the way. If you see a moment to teach, then instruct with empathy and love. Meditation is a beautiful thing because it draws people from all sorts of backgrounds. Because some have secular beliefs and others nonsecular, it’s important to always respond with understanding and empathy. There’s so much wisdom that everyone brings to the table due to the plethora of reasons that brought everyone here, and it’s important to not gate keep. No one knows everything. 
  
Breathe In. Breathe Out. Let Go."

any tips or things that might help an absolute beginner would be greatly appreciated! i shall check back in 30 days and let everyone know how i find it"

Onthewaytomore	2021-04-25 21:57:55+00:00	Daily meditation uncovering deep feelings?	"Hi guys,

I recently came from abroad, where I really
enjoyed life, worked hard on my business and experienced inner happiness. Since i came back a week go i’ve been going hard on meditation and other positive routines. I’ve been meditating 2-4 times a day and really reaching deeper states. Even though i’ve been eating healthy, doing good routines and meditating a lot, the past few days i’ve been feeling unmotivated to work on my business and a little down/depressed. Not to say very down but i’ve been feeling ‘meh’. Could this be the meditation unlayering deeper emotions from my past which i’m now experiencing in order to let go? I’ve also just surpassed 1.2 years of semen retention which has been great in all aspects BUT it has made me a lone wolf because i’m simply no longer interested in the topics 99% people talk about or engaging in those type of behaviors."

wallstreetentre	2021-04-25 21:04:50+00:00	The simple act of correcting my posture during meditation impacted my whole experience. Also this will help those having difficulty noticing the breath.	"&amp;#x200B;

(**TL:DR -** **at bottom)**

First and foremost , I have to thank this community. I always come here for advice to further my meditation practice and everyone has been really helpful providing tips or insights.

Something I always struggled with was noticing my breathing and having a real steady place to focus. If I focused on my nostrils I would end up controlling my breathing. So then I heard many meditation instructions advise for practitioners to use the abdomen as a place of focus ....except for me I couldn't notice my breathing there either.

I felt stuck and to make things worse my body was telling me I was stressed because I would sigh frequently or take random deep inhalations.

However I remedied all of this by simply changing my posture. I would usually slouch a lot even during meditation but in daily life as well. This impacted my breathing more than I knew. So I set the intention to have a straight/erect posture for my entire 15 minute meditation practice and it was game changing , I was able to feel my breathing throughout  my entire body , I could feel my breathing in my diaphragm , my stomach naturally rising and falling. All this because of simply correcting my posture. 

As someone who's now on their 224th day of straight meditation posture has been the biggest help in regards to allowing my to really notice and concentrate on the breath and having my body naturally breath on its own. I will say at first I was uncomfortable since I slouched all the time but the benefits of feeling my breath clearly outweighed. 

I hope this little piece of advice or insight helps someone else in the way others in this community have helped me. 

&amp;#x200B;

***TL:DR - By changing my posture I was able to detect my breathing in my diaphragm and my whole body which improved my meditation practice.***"
R0bin-S	2021-04-25 20:36:34+00:00	LP lI just so not want to sit with my thoughts	"My brain is not a nice place. My thoughts are mean. I feel a rising fear and panic when I think about meditating. I know it will be good for me in the long term, I am just scared about that first hump.

 I know I am going to have to sit through my brain goblins wanting to either push me out of sitting and breathing or throwing up loads of unhappy thought and memories, and I just don't want to do that. I like being on autopilot, it's comfy.
No connection to myself means no connection to my negative feelings. I'm not looking forward to that bit.

Does anyone recognise this fear/apprehension?"
omitfud	2021-04-25 20:17:58+00:00	How noticeable are the benefits?	"Hi, just wondering how much meditation actually helps. I have problems with willpower over daily things like homework. Just looking for people with personal experience of meditation actually benefiting them. It’d also be helpful to hear how long you meditate per session and how often and for how long you’ve been doing so. 
 Not looking for an overnight change or anything, just a tool that can possibly enrich life"
SamathaTRUTH	2021-04-25 20:09:36+00:00	Press into your solar plexus for an intense calming effect.	"The solar plexus is located behind your stomach, under your ribcage (you will feel a bone in there, DO NOT push on that bone, press about an inch under). It's a collection of nerves running together.

This is great to do before meditation or honestly at any time. I suspect it has an effect on the vagus nerve but honestly I don't know, it just works.

1. Press the area described above with a few fingers.
2. Breathe in and let your fingers rise with your belly.
3. As you exhale, you will have much more give, press deeper inside.
4. Repeat this a few times, you can go quite deep and feel the pressure but don't cause yourself pain, that's not the point.
5. Hold like this for a few breaths (allowing your fingers to rise somewhat with the inbreath, but return with the exhale)
6. Once you're finished, don't immediately release the pressure, do it gradually.

Just observe what it does to your state of mind. ;)"

HeroDeadLer	2021-04-25 19:50:00+00:00	Bawling my eyes out and feeling goosebumps all over my body while meditating	"I am not a regular meditator, recently discovered about the practise but still not 100% determined to do it every single day.

I quit all social media apps recently, and started just laying and contemplating in my room realizing that my life is kinda watching youtube videos all the time even though I have passions.

After some contemplation about a frustrating event I had earlier that day I said to myself ""why not meditate for about 30minutes because I feel kinda uninspired and depressed?"".

And so I did it a litle different this time using i method called do-nothing meditation where you're not allowed to move a muscle and face the discomfort.

I was doing it for about 8 minutes and it was really uncomfortable but I just accepted all itches and discomforts and for a moment everything went blank and i kinda felt like levitating then all of a sudden a wave of strong goosebumps hit me like a truck and I started crying like crazy. I think it was a happy cry, reminding me that this practise is indeed something profound. The idea that I got thoose goosebumps just by sitting in a chair is something mind-boggling to me."

I know meditation is helping with anxiety and I started to search youtube videos to get me relaxed, like this one for example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1041yCk6B4&amp;t=7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1041yCk6B4&amp;t=7s) and this helped a lot.

But still, I'm thinking that maybe I should go and see a therapist now, just to be sure that I won't have and long-term consequence to my mental health and get over these stressful times completely...

olenka2017	2021-04-25 17:55:24+00:00	Am I doing it all wrong?	"I feel like I hit a cul-de-sac with my meditation practice recently. I have been meditating daily for over a year now, and it has helped me massively in terms of my anxiety, depression, and anger. I learned to observe myself slipping into depression, and to see my thoughts and moods as products of my mind, without engaging in them. It has definitely improved my quality of life. But it has made me feel... detached? More nihilistic? I was chasing spirituality and wanted to feel happiness and bliss. Instead, what meditation did is make it clear that I don't have to think thoughts that come into my head, and that I am not even the one producing them, and that they don't matter. And that it good, but I come to this subreddit sometimes to read about experiences that seem close to what one would experience on psychedelics, like the feeling of one-ness with the world. I don't see how what I am doing could get me there...  I guess I am not sure whether I am on the right path anymore. I would really appreciate some guidance, maybe some resources you can link, and also just want to listen to your own experiences."

Near my home there is a large cemetery and it is very quiet and full of nature sounds such as birds chirping. I began to meditate there on a bench recently but it freaked me out a little because of the thought of all the bodies buried around me. It also made me contemplate death in general which causes me a good deal of fear from time to time. 

Does anyone think this is a good idea?"
joestrwrs	2021-04-25 17:41:41+00:00	Discomfort While Meditating	"I’ve been practicing mindfulness-based meditation for a couple of months now. I am using a few apps in my rotation and have mostly been doing 10-20 minute length sessions.

Occasionally, my leg will begin to fall asleep, due to sitting cross-legged. The process has the typical predictable pattern, starting as a slight numbness, numbness increases, then slight pain, and honestly I haven’t really let it get much beyond that. Perhaps when I become more experienced at the practice, it will be an excellent object of mindfulness and good training for finding equanimity through physical or emotional pain, but at this point in my practice it mostly highjacks the session and makes it difficult to follow the breath or anything else. And I’m at the point of practicing where I am learning to observe thoughts without grabbing onto them, so this can add another level of difficulty to that process.

I’ve tried various different ways to sit to try and reduce the occurrence. But so far whenever it has come up, I’ve been acknowledging, noting, and calmly accepting it (at least for the first few minutes) but then mindfully decide to move my leg to alleviate the discomfort. 

I think that when I really try to investigate why it is uncomfortable, and what it truly feels like physically and emotionally, I am able to withstand it a little longer. But it feels like there is a fear of permanent nerve damage or something else (bordering on irrational, perhaps) that ultimately “wins” and gets me to move.

Just wanted to see if anyone else has this or a similar type of experience."

Before any hate comments remember that criticizing isn't the same as hating.
There is another post on here about the same topic as this post and the comments are angry people which just shows drug users aren't actually meditating properly if they got so angry at a reddit post :)"

I'm a beginner at meditation, and have been attempting to start with 10 minutes of unguided mindfulness meditation at the start of my day, every day. I've been having some trouble when I attempt this, because I find myself narrating everything internally while I meditate.  


For example, when I try to pay attention to my breathing, internally, my internal monologue will be saying something along the lines of ""Okay, we're breathing in, now out. One breath. Two breaths. Three breaths. What does that feel like? Slight pressure in the chest is we breathe in, slight relief as we breathe out"" and so on.  


I find no matter how much I attempt to focus on the experience, I am unable to stop narrating it, and it feels like a verbal filter keeping me from being present in the moment without taking the involuntary step of putting it into words.  


Does anyone else have any experience with this, or any advice on how to silence that inner monologue?"

And my anxiety is getting in the way and I’m starting to worry that the efficacy of grinding her courses is going to plateau at some point.  Thus I’d love to ask the hive here for help and recommendations.

Why do I believe I connect with Sarah:  She is the first meditation teacher that I have truly connected with.  It’s a combination of her voice, her structure of her “podcast” like sessions.  The breath and inward image focused love secular, image based, almost hypnotic imagery  and the perfectly timed cinematic music has helped me meet my home inside myself and my inner family.  Also to meet my spirit inside of me that I can now ground in.  A true blessing and life change.

So dear one, I’d love to hear your recommendations.  I have insight timer and this ask is important enough I’d try any other platform to find the right teacher.

Thanks in advance.

sowmi245	2021-04-25 14:45:07+00:00	Four Reasons Why You Should Learn To Meditate	" ***I know, I can hear you saying it now, ""Why would Meditation Help Me? Isn't Meditation for the Great Eastern Gurus?"" The categorical answer is NO! Every single person on this planet should learn to meditate to help you in your day-to-day growth, to help you cope with the world, and to help you deal with your anxiety.***

**Let me explain ...**

The whole role of meditation is to help find the inner peace that is the art of putting all that chaos in your mind and you live into some sort of order. The first step of meditation is bringing you to a point of calm, a point of peace upon which you can build and manage control. Once you have achieved that you can further explore your own mind. Our mind today often swirls with information, facts, stress, worries, and much more simply because of the way in which we live and the bombardment of information from commercial entities. The role of meditation is to help you find a way of managing that information and to reflect on your surroundings.

**Meditation** will help you to find that point at which you can cope and manage all the bombardments without feeling overwhelmed but that is not the only reason we meditate. Let me outline four reasons why you should consider learning the art of meditation.

**Reason 1 - Meditation Will Assist You In Calming**

One of the core reasons why an individual might learn meditation is to help with their ability to cope with stress and to become calm. One of the roles of meditation is to help release the alpha waves in both our left and right side of our brains. These alpha waves will help bring about a sense of calm, similar to when you would whistle a happy tune or simply daydream.

Learning to **meditate** and bring you to a state of calm will help you cope with the daily stress of life. From personal experience, I have found that if I do not meditate for 20 minutes a day minimum, I find that my ability to cope with the daily stress of work is far harder than when I have completed my meditation.

**Reason 2 - Meditation Can Help You Lower Your Blood Pressure**

I personally have experienced the effect meditation can have on your blood pressure. Many a time I have gone without meditating for a number of days and my blood pressure has slowly crept up. I have done many experiments with my blood pressure and meditation and this is one I encourage you to try. I simply bought an electronic blood pressure machine which you can buy from a pharmacist or chemist for about $200 Australian. I first checked my blood pressure to find out what it currently is. I then did 20 minutes of meditation and checked it again. I found that both my blood pressure and my heart rate had dropped by up to 30%. I have also tried doing the same exercise but instead of meditating, I just sit for 20 minutes and relaxing but I have found I do not get anywhere near the same improvement. Generally, I would only see about 5 to 10% improvements.

I have seen many research documentaries that have illustrated in a practical way how simply using basic meditation techniques can decrease your blood pressure and your heart rate. Visit your local library and check out the books and research they have on meditation. You will be surprised how many doctors now encourage their patients to learn meditation. My GP (General Practitioner) and his wife actually run guided courses on meditation.

**Reason 3 - Meditation Can Help With Creativity**

There is a lot of who do about meditation and a lot of people call themselves meditation experts. Honestly, I do not buy into that for one simple reason. Meditation is about you. When you are meditating there will be no one else in your head except for you, so in the end, you are the expert on your own meditation techniques. However, I will say that there are many people who can help you in learning meditation but ultimately, if you are listening to them while you are meditating you are not focusing on your inner self but on your outer self.

I have been told that I am one of the most prolific writers out there. It is normal for me to sit down in the morning and by the afternoon I will have belted out 5 to 10 articles of 1,000 to 2,000 words and my editors would not print my material if it was not of excellent quality. One of the reasons I believe I am able to achieve this is because of my meditation regime. When I have completed my meditation, my mind is free of stress which really opens my creativity. I just like many writers suffer, what we like to call, ""Writers' block"". Often this is caused simply because of the chaos of the information in our head.

If I have a situation where writer's block is really setting in, I simply stop, head to my meditation area for 20 minutes, and once I am finished, I will always have a swirl of great ideas to complete my material. One thing to note though, I have found that Baroque Music at 60 beats a minute, works best for getting that creativity flowing. I prefer this style of meditation music, over tranquil water flowing or the sounds of the open bush simply because the 60 beats a minute, helps release far more alpha waves in my brain.

To give you an idea of how powerful Baroque Meditation music at 60 beats a minute can be, the Coca-Cola Retail Research Council found that relaxed customers would in fact purchase 38% more than those who were not relaxed.

[Click here to see our free meditation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH3B8CNUE9I)

**Reason 4 - Meditation Can Help With Learning**

If meditation can help with creativity then it also stands to reason that mediation music can help with learning. In particular Baroque Meditation, music makes the perfect background for all training and learning environments from pre-school to government ""think tanks."" In fact, it is used in schools all over Australia. A quote from the teacher of a remedial class here in Australia: ""It seems to slow them down so they can think.""  
Corporate trainers can improve the effectiveness of training sessions dramatically. A colleague uses baroque meditation music as a background for his memory. In fact, I have been using Baroque Meditation Music in some of our computer sessions and I have seen dramatic improvements in the way people cope with our technical training.  
Look, the days of meditation being only for the hippies or eastern religions like Buddhism are over. Anyone who has ever tried meditation will tell you that you certainly will feel a sense of calm and as you become more proficient you will find your ability to copy, be creative and learn more will be improved. The challenge that most people fear with meditation is that they will look foolish or their peers might think less of you but in all honesty, you may be surprised to find out that the people you think will look at you as foolish are in fact the ones using meditation daily."

utiputigen	2021-04-25 14:19:17+00:00	Is the “goal” of meditation to integrate objectless awareness (awareness of awareness) into everyday experience?	"I’m a little lost because if yes how do you listen to what others say, watch movies, read books if you’re being aware of the subject (that, which is aware) instead of objects. Thank you guys in advance 🙏🏽

Edit: It’s just when I am aware of awareness I feel imperturbable peace but once I focus on an external object, that peace wavers, and it seems like I can only set aside time to feel peaceful instead of carrying the quality into every experience. (It’s like I have to ignore any object to feel that peace: a thought, a person talking to me, a movie on the screen. Once I focus, though — thoughts come rushing in)

Makes me wonder what the difference is between an enlightened person, and one who isn’t (in terms of their attention, for example)?"

I have severe anxiety which I'm currently on medication for, sertraline/zoloft.  I was browsing the other day when I came across something about Ray Dalio and TM meditation.  I looked into it further, am reading the book. 

I have tried meditating before but the focus on breath thing makes me feel way more anxious. I've done this TM one the past couple of days, yesterday I noticed I had more energy and felt more positive which is amazing.

However, I was reading Bob Roth book last night when I read that you're not supposed to just sit and repeat your mantra in your head? Which is what I've been doing. I'm not exactly sure what to actually do? Or if I'm doing it right?

Can anyone help me out a bit? 

Thanks so much :)"

Essah01	2021-04-25 10:39:55+00:00	Half Lotus or Full Lotus with half of the time spend in the Meditation? Any Tips?	"Hello everyone, so I am doing longer sessions like 45 minutes in Half Lotus and feel pretty comfortable with it and I thought I would take it to next step to the Full Lotus.
There were some issues I encountered. First of all flexibility wise I can hold it for a bit like 22 minutes only with my left feet up first in the position and then my right feet over left leg. So I can not really do it when I try to put my right feet in position first and then my left one. I guess flexibility wise I need too stretch more.
Aside from that after a while my feet slips from the position. 
Also I feel like I tense up in the legs more than usual to hold the position.
I use some blanket as a cushion btw. .

In contrast I feel the half Lotus is pretty comfortable and I can hold the position for longer.

Now I wonder which may be more beneficial.

Im guessing that the Full Lotus take some practise and time. I was thinking about doing both. 

So what are your guys take on this? And how did you progress?

I for myself do some stretching to open the hips more and more."

1) dealing with long covid;
2) anxiety and depression as a result of long covid and maybe from weaning my toddler (seeing a doctor),
3) want to become a better parent;
4) want to become better at achieving my goals, better at communicating, listening, helping others;
5) I wish I could just learn how to enjoy little things and stay present. 

I've started meditation with Insight Timer. So far so good, I am able to stick to it, but I feel like I'll never get there. My mind is so active!! So I'm looking for some experiences from people who where very much fused with their minds, was it long until you noticed some new space emerging where you could feel calm and observe your mind? Any encouragement is welcomed! Thank you for the sense of community!"
ti-vi-di-aitch	2021-04-25 10:07:06+00:00	looking for healing	"hey everyone!

i have this condition called paruresis which basically means i have a shy bladder and can’t pee when people are around me. doesn’t matter if i’m at home or not, my body shuts down as soon as i’m on the toilet. now, in my daily life i hear a lot of stuff like “have you tried exposure therapy?” or “you just pee, it’s not that hard. just think differently” or “have you tried changing your thought patterns through cognitive behavior therapy?”. i get it, it’s a very basic human thing to do, peeing. so, i understand why it’s hard for people to really get this problem. but you can understand it sometimes makes me feel like my problem is really dumb, but in reality it’s pretty serious and i just want answers :’(

this is what happens. there’s is a fear of going to the toilet and i can’t pee. there are thoughts accompanying that emotion. then there’s the physical part which is the tension through my whole body that shuts down the process of peeing. these three things are connected which makes it a complex thingy. i’ve tried so much exposure, but because there’s a physical component it’s hard to change your way of thinking and control your body in that way. i’m familiar with ways to let go of emotions and integrate them, different techniques etcetera. i’ve grown so so much the past year because of that, but the shy bladder is still there. i know it’s ok to sit on the toilet longer then others, it’s ok if they hear me pee, but it’s the tension i can’t seem to release.. 

i feel motivated to do anything that could lead me to healing! maybe there’s someone out there with same experiences or someone that knows some alternative healing that could work. so please every tip is welcome (except “you should try exposure therapy” because then you just don’t understand this problem :p )

thank you for putting the effort in reading this and maybe giving me some advice! i appreciate you all &lt;3"

treasure in it. I realize now

that I must give all that I have

to possess it. Life is not hurrying

**Is the Law of Attraction Real? (And How Do I Make It Work?)**

Can you really get rich using the law of attraction? What is LOA?

The “law of attraction” is frequently abbreviated to LOA and the “law of attraction” is very real. There have been countless people who have made themselves rich using the LOA.

The Law of Attraction was first popularized in the book “Think and Grow Rich,” by new thought author, Napoleon Hill about the idea that anyone can become rich if they first, mindfully think in a positive and specific way. The essential plausibility of the law of attraction is the same as the central thesis of all religions. Belief. Essentially, it is about the action of belief.

 

How to make the LOA work for you Hold that good-feeling belief space in your mind and body, so that it is the only vibration you are generating. Like attracts like. Every thought has a frequency. If you are thinking a thought over and over again you are emitting that frequency.

The brain produces electrical activity from the ion currents flowing among neurons during synaptic transmission (thinking), and in accordance with Maxwell’s equations, any electric current produces a magnetic field. Your thoughts are magnetic.

When you use the LOA you are tapping in the field of possibility which exists in one of the folded dimensions inside our own. By holding the feeling and vibration of what you want to manifest you are essentially pulling it out of the field of possibility into the one in which you exist, physically. Of course, what you want to manifest doesn’t (usually) pop up into existence like a miracle. It works its way into your life in a seemingly organic way.

I can’t tell you how many times I have manifested large amounts of money for myself using these techniques. I don’t care if there are doubters. You can doubt all you want. Just move along then, nothing to see here.

But for those of you who instinctively know what I’m saying is true and are reading this to strengthen your own belief, then BELIEVE. Because it is the action of the BELIEF in the FEELING of the belief that causes you to manifest. Maybe, the Universe sent you this little gift of knowledge and remembering today, to help you stay on track.

The LOA is real but is poorly understood

You are creating and holding “feelings” in your body and mind when you practice LOA. These feelings need to come from a place of internal peace and power. If you are feeling grasping or panicky you are not in the right headspace. This takes a lot of work, learning how to clear and center yourself properly.

For best results, try not to manifest “things.” Instead, manifest “feelings.”

For example, you may want a lot of money because of the desire for freedom or security. There are many paths to freedom and security, and money generally has a lot of mental baggage and feelings of unworthiness attached to it, so that may not be the ideal way of manifesting those feelings.

Ironically, focusing on needing and hoarding a large amount of money is a lack mentality. This is called the world of hungry ghosts. You are objectifying money and giving it too much power and importance in your life. What you probably want instead is to be freed from money restricting you in some way. Feel and imagine a great amount of money flowing to you. Imagine yourself feeling happy, satisfied, and at peace as you receive a large amount of money.

Creating the feeling and vibration of freedom and flexibility to do what you want in life, is better. Holding this space for yourself is key. It is a very different vibe than a vibe of acquiring the money which can be based on a feeling of grasping want.

**The LOA also has limitations**

If the vibration you put out is getting a lot of interference patterns from the people around you, it will not work as well as it could. If you want to manifest something, be sure not to share your desire and goal with someone who is not completely supportive. It’s a strange occurrence when you begin to shift your energy, sometime the people in your life will react badly. That is because on some level, the people in your life can feel your change and it triggers deep fears about themselves. They want you to stay the same so that they feel comfortable.

Spend your day constantly reminding yourself to take a deep breath and centering yourself. Imagine yourself in a cocoon of white golden light of protection. Learn how to ground your energy. From this space, you can begin your manifestations with the LOA.

Be mindful of limiting your exposure to negative people and places, including social media. This will drain you and your ability to manifest faster than anything.

**Take a deep breath. Do it right now.**

Visualize you are surrounded by white golden light. Breath this golden-white light through the center of your body and feel it expand to a cocoon. Focus on clearing all negativity from your energy. Let the golden-white light energy wash away all negativity. Now, from THIS space, visualize what you want to achieve.

TruthBetweenWords	2021-04-24 22:54:21+00:00	It's like I drew the card in Candyland that sends you all the way to the end. Now I don't understand how to play the game.	"I had an experience once that was life changing.  Eye opening.  According to Daniel Ingram I crossed the arising and passing away.  I had a spiritual psychosis, an emergent crisis, a shamanic awakening, bipolar mania mixed with mindfulness to produce a profound meditative state.  It took me a year to realize it was a real thing I went through, and not ""just some psychosis.""  

I'm just saying, I get it.  I get the implications of meditation.  I get what it can do for serenity and presence.  As far as I understand, I've had one of the more profound meditative experiences a person can have.  And it's fucking torturous.  Because I don't actually know how to meditate.  I'll yell ""fuck off"" after under a minute of sitting. 

What's worse, the worst, is that I have expectations.  I don't know how to let go of expectations.  I can't just sit for the sake of sitting without longing for blasting off into Christville.  This will probably be downvoted immediately and my feelings will be hurt and I'll delete it.  I just feel so lost and fucking helpless.  And the more I try to hold onto that special experience the more it slips through my fingers."
KundalinirRZA	2021-04-24 22:46:00+00:00	"No matter the location, most cultures have recognized the sun as the prime controller of all life on Earth because without it, life here could not exist."	"
As the Earth rotates daily on its axis, every morning the sun brings light to the darkness, warmth and comfort to the chill of night, photo synthesis to plants, and security to humans. 

It's for this reason that as far back as 14,000 8.C.E., adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cave walls. Countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Mayans and the Aztecs, and the Australian Aborigines, to name just a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source of enlightenment, illumination, and wisdom. 

While the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on Earth because the Earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields.

On a grand scale, it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between the sun's energy, the Earth's energy, and the energy of all living species. On a micro level, all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit or vegetable to understand this interdependence. 

Consciously absorbing that energy to combine with your own Spiritual Energy has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more.

Your spiritual energy goes under many different names like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.

Here's a 3 minute [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/uKdiTTbWbIA) expanding more on the benefits and how to, actually absorb the energy from the sun, through your own self-induced voluntary goosebumps from positive events/thoughts/memories/feelings."

Fruitblood-	2021-04-24 22:33:06+00:00	Seeing through my eyelids.	"Hello. I’m a m(26) who recently began mediation and had an intense experience. 

As a preface I’ll say that i live with bpd and severe depression. 
My doctor recommended that I try to mediate and suggested a few resources. 

Amongst those he recommended reading the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh. 
I have a very active mind and mediation is something I’ve failed to understand and I’ve been extremely close minded towards it until recently. 

A few nights ago I decided to go to bed early to be well rested and to have an opportunity to begin reading. 
After smoking a bowl I decided to read the first ten or so pages of “How to Relax” by T.N.H. 

It guided me through a few breathing exercises and had a few allegorical poems. After about ten minutes of reading I decided to close my eyes while sitting on my bed. Focused on my breath while reciting:

“breath In. I am breathing in. Breathe out. I am breathing out”

After about ten minutes or so I felt relaxed and decided to lay down and go to sleep. 
I shut all of my lights off and began to try and sleep.
Mind you I wasn’t exhausted. Completely conscious and still bouncing a few thoughts around my head. I opened my eyes and decided to look at my stationary clock for the time. 

After 2 or so minutes I began to see a faint light with my eyes closed. I moved my hand to my face to brush hair away and noticed that I could see the difference in light with my hand in front of my face. 

I opened my eyes again  briefly to look at my clock. Assuming that the faint light from it was making my eyes sensitive. 

I closed my eyes again and waved my arm in front of my closed eyes. 

Almost at once, most of the objects in my room, and my arms were somewhat visible with my eyes closed. 
The shapes of objects in my room were rough and losing form. However my arms appeared in full but covered in a black shadow. 

I assumed that at the angle I was laying, my eyes were partially open. So I held my eyelids closed with one hand and with the other kept waving and could still see shapes and my arms. 

A white light appeared in front of me and I reached out to it. 

It disappeared and turned into a black figure that was shaped vaguely like a human. 

(This is all in A minute or two window. ) 

In the past I’ve been known to have extremely vivid flashing visuals when trying to sleep. Usually stressful or gory imagery (stress related). 
I was scared and opened my eyes. Immediately I turned to my phone and googled “seeing through my eyelids”. 

At the time I hadn’t related it to mediation whatsoever. But every search result was about meditation. 

I teared up immediately. Didn’t know the true power of meditation. I rushed to my living room to tell my brother who of course asked if I was intoxicated or having “sleep paralysis”

I have a long history with sleep paralysis but this was nothing like it. I was totally conscious of my mind and body. Nowhere near sleep. 

Please tell me if you’ve had a similar experience. 
I know it sounds out there but I’m recalling it exactly as it happened. 

Much love"

peaceiseverystepp	2021-04-24 17:16:02+00:00	Happiness can feel like it's outside our control - but you have more influence than you realise	"The four noble truths of the Buddha are simple to express: suffering is part of life, but happiness is possible and we make choices in every moment that lead us to happiness / suffering. The reason its revolutionary is that it paints a picture where our happiness isn’t an external factor that's outside of our control, it’s something that’s within our reach with some practice, some patience and some persistence.

Which is not to say that you should beat yourself up for not being happy - its as important to practice non-judgement for yourself as for others, because every person you see if doing the best they can given their circumstances, including you.

So how do we train ourselves to be happy? The first step is to focus on the positive.  This might not be where our minds go automatically - humans have a natural negativity bias, a leftover from our our evolution where we’re more focused on where there might be wolves than where there’s flowers. This is completely understandable as it kept us alive for thousands of years but its something we need to be aware of when living our modern lives. Social media is very focused on the negative because that’s what grabs our attention. Research shows that consuming any kind of media that is mostly negative affects our mental health. So we need to be careful what we consume.

We can also make a choice in every moment to focus on the good things we have and be grateful for them rather than seeing what we don’t have or what’s wrong. This takes time and patience as we might be very used to focusing on the negative. I live in Britain and we love to have a moan, especially about the weather but it’s within our gift to appreciate the great things that are all around and regularly meditate on them or capture them in a gratitude journal. On the flip side can notice our judgmental thoughts arise, listen to them without getting involved or judging and watch them pass without acting on them. This is how we train ourselves to focus on the positive.

The second step is smiling to your difficulties. This sounds absolutely crazy - why would you want to smile when things are difficult? There's two reasons - the first is neurological. When you smile, even if you don’;t feel like smiling, your brain releases chemicals which reduce stress and lift your mood - so its a very easy way to change how you’re feeling. That's why we gently smile while we meditate.

The other way smiling helps is that it reduces the power those difficulties have over you in your mind. When we see anger, anxiety and sadness as our enemies that rob us of our peace then (naturally) we’re afraid of them - we try and block out the thoughts and we run to consumption to help us out, which of course never works in the long term. When we smile to our difficulties, our difficult emotions and say, “there you are, my old friend”, we accept what we’re feeling without judgement, we reduce our suffering.

DavenKyu	2021-04-24 16:06:10+00:00	I have a problem with Samatha and Vipassana.	"I tried Samatha: Focusing only in my breathing. But that's not for me. When I try to do this, I start to fight everything that arises (thoughts, sensations, emotions, etc) and the meditation turns into a struggle and I end up frustrated, feeling worse.

What I usually do is called Vipassana/Mindfulness: focusing on my breathing until something arises (thoughts, feelings, emotions, sensations, perceptions, anything). The problem with this is that when that happens I feel my attention is splitted, because or I pay attention to my breathing or to my thoughts. I can't pay focused attention to two things at the same time, right?"

"I'm interested in meditation because I'm interested in things like lucid dreaming, astral projection and other weird stuff like visiting your past self and souch. But the question is where do I start? How do I begin with that? I did meditation before with no reaserch by just focusing on my breathing and trying to clear my mind. But I don't know if I was doing it right. So I want to find out how do I start? And how do I achieve things like visiting other dimensions trough meditation (or at liest feel like I am) because I know it could just be all made up by your own mind but I'm still interested in that."

I'm new here(in this group) and want to ask if someone has an advice for practicing mindfulness meditation? 

I mean like when you walk to feel the ground or taking showers with mixed temperatures.. 

The reason is that I dissociate( i do a trauma therapy and have many people who help me on this way) and I'm on my way to deal with it well... I'm tired of pushing myself away.. I'm ready to live again..

I dont except THE solution and not a quick solution.. 
I just hope for a direction and idea.. this would be very nice..

I think about going naturopath.. but I dont know if they are expensive here.. have to ask.. anyway first of all I wanted to ask you all :)

AcharyaPrashant_	2021-04-24 15:04:05+00:00	Beware of the cult of mindfulness	"Spirituality is the transcendence of consciousness. Spirituality is to see that all elements of consciousness are in the same dimension and are not to be taken seriously.

Mindfulness makes you take everything seriously. Even a simple act like walking is now being taken very seriously. Spirituality gives you the freedom to fly in abandon, fly without any mindfulness, zero mindfulness. What is happening, is just happening. I don’t need to be mindful.

Isn't mindfulness such a curse, such a burden?"

sml930711	2021-04-24 14:16:09+00:00	switched to Zazen from Vipassana	"Sitting, facing wall, eyes open pointed downwards, and no object which is the Soto Zen approach of “Shikantaza” (just sitting)

Hard to explain why but it feels like a better fit. I tend to overthink and that extends into overthinking “insight”, even though both probably lead to the same thing at the end
but simply a different approach

Intro level meditations may start the same, as both may be introduced to beginners to focus on breathing. 

I have only went to one Soto Zen introductory class and taken nothing formally on Vipassana. I just did guided meditations and listening to monks for a Theravada-based approach to mindfulness for a while before gaining a fascination for Zen, so I am no expert on either."

MarlesGong	2021-04-24 13:52:28+00:00	"I experienced the ""vibrational state"" a couple days ago for her first time."	"I was meditating in a krishna temple while repeating ""I am"" mindfully and confidently in my mind. I had dropped in and my breathing was deep and slow. Then, all of the sudden my entire body started buzzing and vibrating throughout! My body was absolutely still, and my cells did the vibrating. It was a beautiful and powerful feeling, but in a loving God powerful way. It was as if the vibration testified and confirmed ""I am"". Seriously one of the best feelings and experiences I've ever had.
I haven't studied the stages of meditation yet, is there anything else I should know about this experience? I've seen it mentioned a lot referring to astral projection, but I've never even attempted that."

lukefromdenver	2021-04-24 13:25:51+00:00	"I worked 11 hours yesterday on my fast-day, came home and crashed, didn't meditate, and was unhappy."	"When I break my good life pattern (which is healthy for the mind once in a while) I am always headed for some kind of discomfort, merely psychological in nature (it's not real, it's like you've forgotten something and don't know what it is). This causes an undercurrent of fear to crop up that might at first be registered as an agitation, but then rebounds as a gripping dread, maybe associated with a specific thing or event one anticipates in the future.

Of course, this sort of thing can't be sustained by the system for long; it's unhealthy at a certain point, and sleep is a good remedy. There is no positive physiological reaction occurring as a result of this sort of mind, and thus it is not caused by any defect in practice; it is scattering of the mind's potency. Having a couple decades of practice at this point, I can say, again, it's psychological in nature, arising from a combination of fatigue and general mental overload; though there may be components of the fear grounded in reality, the mind is projecting something additional into the memories of the day causing misapprehension. 

In life, among non-meditators, there is no remedy but rest and time. But for the meditator, we have a way of reorienting ourselves. By emptying the mind, connecting to our physical body, regaining balance throughout our systems regulated by breath and the enhanced flow of blood and awareness through the nerves, and by mentally connecting with centers along the spine which direct flows in specific regions of the body—simply by our being aware of them—we can very quickly rebound and reconnect to our source in the heart, which then opens the door to the higher centers of cognition (energy), understanding (bliss), and then peace (connection with God). 

For me (and everyone is wired a bit different) I wake up and feel like an astronaut. It's a disconnection from my body, and almost a numbness throughout—a weightlessness—though it's uncomfortable. I've learned that before I even get out of bed I should say a prayer and try to connect to my toes. I begin my process of rooting straightaway; flexing muscles throughout my legs, and finding each muscle in my *perineum*, which I will link instead of describe.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum

The root, or lowest, *chakra* (which is condensed energy or awareness arising at a particular point along the spineal column), called *muladhara* in Sanskrit, is often described as being the anus, and perhaps that is true, but to me I register it as an awareness throughout the region. 'Opening' a chakra is registered as *flow*. Increased flow causes organs in the region to cycle through their functions with ease. The return of awareness causes a kind of enjoyment, a blissful rather than disturbed awareness of the body arises, progressively moving up the tree from the roots."

PeddoPedro	2021-04-24 11:51:04+00:00	Meditating for dummies?	"Hello!

I recently finished a book about a guy that quit his career to live as a monk in the woods for 17 years, hearing his story has really inspired me to pick up the habit of meditating. I have always been fascinated by it and have been thinking it's something that would benefit me, but I have not put it to practice.

The last 2 days however I have started to meditate for a few minutes before bed, I'm not really sure if I'm doing it right though so I have a few questions.

Is the goal always to not think of anything? For example if I'm having some actual deep and meaningful thoughts, am I supposed to steer clear of them and focus on my breathing or is it ok to think while I meditate?

Is it important how I breathe? I usually breathe in with my nose and out with my mouth.

Is my pose for sitting down important? Can I sit in my couch with support for my back while I meditate or is it better to sit up straight on the floor? 

How many times a day do you meditate and for how long do you so it?

Thank you for any answers!"

The_Light_Bender	2021-04-24 10:45:38+00:00	THE PATH OF ASCENSION	"THE PATH OF ASCENSION

Our Ascension may be one of the most important things in our lives. 

Our soul’s progression back towards the Oneness of God is the entire reason any of us are alive today. 

Ascensions flow through cycles of construction and deconstruction. This is a sacred process of building strong energetic foundations in order to sustain higher frequency existence. 

Unresolved issues can completely derail enlightenment when enough energy is coursing through your body. It is a known issue for people to abuse newfound power. It is the reason why it is so vital that ancient karmic ties and deep subconscious conditioning be unraveled before exploding us in light. 

The process may seem dark and scary at times. The Universe continues along a destined pathway that ultimately ascends as Unconditional Love. 

Through hundreds of lifetimes on this planet, we are becoming consciously aware of the evolution of the very fabric of our being. We are vibrating higher. People are awakening from a deep slumber. 

There are a lot of predators awaiting this event. Ascending souls are like little baby turtles scuttling towards the safety of the ocean. 

There is a powerful momentum behind everything that is happening in your life. 

When you go through the necessary healing and align with the currents of the Universe, you follow a pathway of no resistance. Acceptance is key. Spiritual integrity is a moral compass that spins around based upon underlying intentions. 

Don’t ever forget why you came here or what most resonates with the ascension of your soul. 

You are a conscious fragment of God.  An immortal multi-dimensional Being of Light, having a temporary human experience.

You are the love of this and every universe.

I can even feel the air in my right nostril better. Yesterday I was dancing alone in my bedroom and I felt the urge to move this side of my body too.

It's really weird and hard to explain, but this happens especially during meditation, and lingers more and more after meditation day after day.  Pretty weird right?"

Afraid to not be understood. Alone with all my thoughts about how life and nature is always changing. About death not being the end. About things I thought mattered, don’t matter at all. My society, my family, and my friends all value surface, shallowness, money, things, power. I value being. I value the mystery of life, the abstract, the incomprehensible. 

I don’t know if my fear is irrational. But I’m so scared that this is the beginning of me going totally crazy. That this is the last time I’ll be in a lucid state, before I lose contact with reality and start living in a phantasy world. I have a dear friend who also came to a breakthrough after years of mental unrest. He just got more and more weird, and today he’s an actual cult leader, with no anchor whatsoever in everyday life or reality. He has no job, no money, nothing that we see as valuable. He just has “eternal presence and love”, as he puts it, but he also talks about “downloading the latest patch for the New Universe” and “battling imaginary dragons that are more real than reality”. 

How do I know I’m not turning crazy like him? Some part of me wants to keep this up, the fearlessness, the equanimity, the moments of peace and positive nihilism. Another part of me wants to remain neurotic, normative, emotional, HUMAN, to not feel LONELY. I just spent the night with my friends and I felt really... I relatable. As if nobody would understand the things I now understand. Please help guys I’m scared, I don’t want to go insane and lose family and friends."

* Seeing lights (eyes closed in a room with no distraction).
* Breathing slowed down dramatically. Almost felt like I was not breathing. But not lightheaded at all.
* Started to notice ""glitches"" popping all over my body. (Hard to describe, maybe nerve endings?)
* Turning waves of light, accompanied by an electric feeling.
* All of a sudden, I was hovering over tendrils of light. Distinct feeling of being somewhere else.
* Opened my eyes and the room seemed like it was in a tunnel for about 30 seconds.
* Me, sitting there saying ""Woah, WTF just happened?!"" for about 3 mins.
* Walking home for 2 miles, it felt like there was no direction (no up/down/left/right), and I couldn't tell if I was walking straight or wobbling all over the place."

HightechTalltrees	2021-04-23 21:14:56+00:00	Sometimes I feel like my soul is bristly	"It's so easy to harbor a feeling of dislike and annoyance toward the world. I find my head full of angry judgements and condescension. 

Sitting can help me realize those thoughts aren't me. Now I just wish they would leave me alone and try not to let them control my actions. It's hard. 

Does anyone have tricks to keep that feeling from building up so much between sessions?"
HeadNshoulders77	2021-04-23 21:00:43+00:00	Panic while driving	"Hello Reddit, and thank you to whoever is reading this. I have hesitated to post this because I do not want to energize this thought any more than I already have and reinforce the idea of a separate ""self"" that is fearful. But I need help. I have been meditating seriously for a year (20-30 minutes) and initially discovered it while ""battling"" with panic disorder. I was having panic attacks several times per day, triggered only by driving on the highway. Through meditation and learning more about attacks, I was able to go back to driving to school every day (30 minutes away) and was pretty much back to normal. However, because of covid starting last year and the lockdowns I no longer drive to school or work, allowing me to be at home all day just working on school stuff. Because of no driving, my panic and anxiety towards the expressway have slowly intensified and again I find myself barely able to be at a stoplight, let alone driving for a while on the highway. I realize the impermanence of anxiety and panic and understand that these attacks can't hurt me, but that fear is so intense especially because I am driving simultaneously. 

I have tried several times to get on the highway and have either gone on and got off at the next exit or just no get on at all. I don't really have a reason to drive because of the pandemic, so the only reason I get on the road is to ""get over"" my fear. When I fail and am not able to make any progress thoughts of guilt and shame about how I'm a loser arise, and I've been getting better at observing those and letting them go. At this point, it may be the fear of fear that is worse than the actual panic, but both scare the shit out of me. I can handle a panic attack anywhere else, but on the highway, it seems impossible while driving a vehicle at high speeds and I don't know how I did it the first time. I'm sorry if this is incoherent as it's difficult to talk about. Any advice or stories from personal experience with this are greatly appreciated. For now, I will continue to meditate and observe as much as possible."

Morc-Glork	2021-04-23 17:31:38+00:00	Can meditation help me build a stronger mind?	"Hello, everyone. Recently I’ve had very intrusive and anxiety ridden thoughts that have really been effecting my life, and after diving in a little deeper, seeing therapists and psychiatrists, I have been diagnosed with a very mild form of OCD. After looking back on life, I’ve always had this. There’s never been an extended period of time where I didn’t have these type of obsessive thoughts, and they’re all very irrational as well. It’s been quite treatable in the past few months. I have sought out cognitive behavioral therapy which has helped a lot, I’ve tried a few different anxiety medications and I think I found the right one, I’ve been reading books by anxiety experts, and have been using some buddhist methods of replacement thoughts to help as well. I of course have flare ups of anxiety and obsessive thoughts, but I know one day I’ll be able to move on from them since in such a short time I have been able to deal with, and move past them. 

I wanted to know if meditation could help me as well, and if so what are the steps I have to take to start? This may seem like a silly question to you guys, but I’m seriously brand new to meditation.

Any response is appreciated"
AcharyaPrashant_	2021-04-23 17:23:00+00:00	The real meaning of meditation	"निःसङ्गो निष्क्रियोऽसि त्वं  स्वप्रकाशो  निरञ्जनः।  
अयमेव हि ते बन्धः समाधिमनुतिष्ठसि।

You are now and forever free, luminous, transparent and still. The practice of meditation keeps one in bondage.

**\~ Ashtavakra Gita (Chapter 1, Verse 15)**  


Ashtavakra is saying that the practice of meditation keeps one in bondage. Why is he saying that? Because the method or technique for meditation cannot come through knowledge. Meditation surely does require a technique because it is the mind that ultimately relaxes, settles, and disappears into meditation. Mind moves only on techniques, so techniques are needed. On the one hand, techniques are needed; on the other hand, as Ashtavakra says, the practice of meditation keeps one in bondage. What is this contradiction? The contradiction is that the technique for meditation too can be known only in meditation. It is your meditation, it is your meditativeness which will automatically, from nowhere, reasonlessly tell you the right technique suited to you and that technique cannot come from anywhere else. No book can tell it to you, no amount of thinking and planning and analyzing can tell it to you. You will just know.

When you are meditative, then you will also know how to live in a meditative way. Living in a meditative way, this itself is the technique for meditation. You will know whom to talk to, you will know what to read, you will know whom to avoid and whom to come close to; you will simply know. The technique itself opens up when you are there. Otherwise, the technique will not be known to you. Otherwise, you will have all these borrowed practices of meditation which are of very little help. What is happening here right now? We are talking about meditation, but even these words about meditation will be meaningful to you only if you are meditative. Only in your meditativeness can you understand these words about meditation. “What is the significance of these words if I already have to be meditative?” It is the words that are bringing you to meditation. “Where are these words coming from?” They are coming from meditation itself. “Then what is the source of all this?” Meditate and you will know.

It is not a crude and linear cause-effect diagram. Do not come up with your chicken and egg story – What comes first, meditation or technique for meditation? Thought will not be able to understand all this. You understand what I say because you are meditative, and you are meditative because I say what I say. What comes first? Meditate. “What does meditation mean?” To throw away this stupid question. When you throw away this stupid question, then you realize that meditation is sufficient. The answer to this question anyway does not matter. What will you do with the answer to this question? You will try to capture it. You will try to do some kind of mischief with it. What else will you do?"
SamathaTRUTH	2021-04-23 17:18:49+00:00	"Enter ""jewel mirror samadhi"" any time, anywhere."	"Following people's kind recommendations, I'm making my way through ""Hidden Zen"" by Meido Moore and I've decided to share with this community the knowledge I find indispensable on the path to enlightenment.

""Jewel mirror samadhi"" is a Zen term, illustrating the reflective quality of the mind and the impermanence of both inner and outer experience. Samadhi specifically means something like focused meditative absorption/sustained peace.

The benefits of this practice are of course awakening to the true nature of reality, but also peace that does not depend on conditions.

Instructions are as follows:

1. Looking ahead with a soft focus, engage your peripheral vision as well and take in your entire field of sight. This already reduces rumination/inner monologue and is a great start.

2. Notice the changes in your field of sight (e.g. rustling of leaves, cars passing by), but don't get attached to anything in particular. Let things come and go, arise and pass away. This is the nature of the world.

3. Allow your field of vision to encompass the source of your seeing as well. Notice that there is no separation between the inner world and the outer world, the seer and the seen. There is just ""seeing""/there is ""no seeing"". The currently observed, ever changing phenomena are what make up your conscious experience (hence the ""jewel mirror"").

4. This of course sheds light on what is meant by the self being an illusion. There is no self, just a similarly ever changing process made up of thoughts and feelings arising and passing away. The observer cannot be separated from the observed, the two only exist in relationship to each other.

5. With sufficient understanding and practice, this method can of course be expanded to include all things heard, felt, smelled and even thought of as well. All senses.

The words of the Heart Sutra ring true:
""Listen Sariputra,
all phenomena bear the mark of Emptiness;
their true nature is the nature of
no Birth no Death,
no Being no Non-being,
no Defilement no Purity,
no Increasing no Decreasing."""

But doing my first session, after about 5 minutes, I had a panic attack. It was the first panic attack I have had in over a month, so I definitely feel like it was caused by the mediation and am scared to try it again.

Is this normal? Is there any way to *not* have panic attacks while meditating? Is meditation just not for me?"
blackplotinus	2021-04-23 15:33:46+00:00	"The Sound Of A Breath, The Original Mantra [aka The Oxygenating Thought-Devourer] and Henosis Over Enlightenment"	" Almost all people when asked to take a deep breath do the same thing. 

What is the sound of an exhale and it's accompanying inhale that we hear in our heads? Can we use that sound to escape awareness?

There's a mantra for the sound of that breath cycle and it just happens to be the Original Mantra. Unfortunately, too many of us came to know this mantra as ""Om"", when ""Aum"" would have been less incorrect but, in the end, still hopelessly inefficient.

As a result a tumult of well-meaning embellishment, invention and personalization has taken place. 

Used correctly, the Original Mantra is so perfect for meditation that it's preposterously easy to explain how it works.

I know that the question sounds ridiculous, but i remember since being a kid i always had this problem even in sports session at school, ""straighten your back, keep your shoulders aligned with your butt"" just doesn't compute easily from formal language to a physical understanding for me, a teacher would try to help for an instance or too, but then i'll keep back to either 1 : ) doing it wrong 2 : ) Wondering if i'm actually doing it wrong and just harming my muscles/back whatever which just creates a new anxiety.

For instance in meditation, when i try to ""straighten my back"" i feel i'm either falling on a side or another, it's not the pain or uncomfort that bother me, but that there is no stability.

I'm just wondering for people who had a similar problem, how did you solve it ? How do you know you are sitting straight or not etc, do you rely exclusively in the comfort ? So that a comfortable position is always a reliable position ? 

Thanks in advance."

I do maybe 15-20 minutes sitting upright (with a pillow for lumbar support) a day. I’ve been having the absolute worst back pain. It’s not my normally shitty posture or workout pain, cause it’s been moving. 

When I started it was really base at the base of my back, like behind the hips, and yesterday and today, the pains been the worst at the area behind the sternum (on the back). Meditation is the only real change I’ve done in this time, so could that be what’s causing it?  If so, what should I do?"

If you can share whatever material that got you started with meditating and that has affected you deeply, I would appreciate it. Also if it's a video you're sharing, is it something that I should listen to while meditating or beforehand?

A little background; I have had a host of quite serious mental health problems &amp; a history of being in abusive environments for most of my life. I'm finally in a place where I'm loved &amp; safe &amp; my meditation practice is genuinely changing my life. I've always had an issue with a filter in terms of what comes out if my mouth, but now I'm finding I'm speaking much less. The thoughts bubble up &amp; then I'm just able to let them go. I have always had a huge problem concentrating. Now I can sit for hours painting (I'm an aspiring artist) with no problems. I also had an issue with my sex drive, mostly because I was so depressed, and also the history of abuse. Now it's like my body and heart have been liberated and I can connect with my partner like we did at the beginning of our relationship again. 

The world is beginning to look beautiful beyond words, I'm so grateful for everything I have &amp; I'm able to approach my vices and shortcomings with a balanced mind, rather than by breaking down like I used to. After so many years of wishing I was dead, I am finally able to just enjoy existing. 

Sorry I'm not sure what kind of discussion I'm seeking. I think I just needed a place to put this out into the world. The feeling is almost overwhelming sometimes, but in a wonderful way. My heart is so full of love. I hope I can share it with you all."

During deep meditation or other awareness expansion techniques, have you experienced this kind of spontaneous movement that seems to have an energy all its own? Please share your experiences, what kind of meditation you were doing and what kind of movements they are. Perhaps you even make spontaneous sounds too.

I am very interested in this phenomenon. it seems to be clearing out the body’s old conditioned energy patterns and rewiring them for more freedom. (PS this video is not me but I’ve experienced very similar movements in my meditation sometimes when I go really deep)."

If it weren't for mid day meditations and evening meditations, I feel like I would have done something stupid by now. I've been so close to giving up so many times and the only thing that has brought me any comfort and peace has been mediation."

Yarmanite	2021-04-23 03:39:48+00:00	How can I best use meditation? My Short Story.	"I think I was a happy kid, I was definitely conscientious of others, almost hyper aware of myself. In school I was very quiet, I went to school every day just hoping someone would socialize with me and be my friend. I didnt know it was a possibility that I could interact with others. I probably have had social anxiety in the past, but now I can do basic adult things without really worrying. I don't think I'm wearing the real me. I'm terrified what others think of me. I feel so constrained by something mental. Ego? I want to be able to have conversations with people and make jokes and have fun but It doesn't seem to come naturally. I am a quiet, monotone, predictable, guy. I want to let go and be expressive and vibrant. If anyone has advice for me I'll gladly hear it. Thanks!"

"I started meditating to calm my anxiety (still a ways to go there) but I found as a ""side-effect"" I care so much less about ""stuff"", I used to buy myself ""presents"", feel I needed up update my wardrobe frequently and there were things I just NEEDED, but now just don't.

Anyone else had a similar experience?"

I also do vipassana every day.

In vipassana, the effects of the drug are not an obstacle. I am a world-eating machine and the drugs are just more world to eat.

This is not a pro or anti statement about drugs.

My point is, drugs are sorta irrelevant in the face of vipassana.

I suppose all varieties of ""world"" are likewise irrelevant.

Yes, talk is cheap. Can I swallow serious pain? Death? A really heavy psychedelic experience?

Maybe. 

And even if I do choke a little, it can still spell the difference between getting swept away in a flood and performing a profitable degree of surfing. 

So ya, vipassana!"

DostThowEvenLift2	2021-04-23 02:12:51+00:00	My friend thinks meditation is suicide. Here is my response:	"Speaking of suicide: Meditation helps me come to terms with the inherent worthlessness of my live. Until I find what's worth more than life, I cannot fully live.

At least I've discovered why I make sacrifices for others at all. It's the same reason people sacrifice their lives for their country: To maintain the platform of freedom and peace that was built by our ancestors. I have reaped the fields that they painstakingly sowed. In light of this realization, I feel inspired to plant new seeds for future generations. Humanity has come a long way as we are nearing the end of the Era of War. What a bright future we have after the scars of war, built up over thousands of generations, are fully healed. I selfishly desire to see the result myself, but I have found peace in knowing that the inspiration to see such prosperity not only persists past my death, but grows throughout my life."

A problem I’ve been having is that due to my scoliosis (30-something degree curve in my spine, uneven hips, semi-frequent back pain), when i sit and try to focus on my breathing, I think frequently about how uneven my back is. I get freaked out and start feeling anxious and depressed when I’m supposed to be feeling a lot lighter. I feel like the curve in my back is magnified and gross and I soon have to get up or lie down just to end that trainwreck of thought.

How do I enjoy meditation when I have a fault in my body that weighs so heavily on my mind? Anyone have success meditating with scoliosis or similar problems?"

Zyler616	2021-04-23 00:23:36+00:00	Too much non attachment to people?	"I was really lucky to have been born with loving and amazing parents who let me be independent and as free as I could be in my context. 
That's why I have been almost never clingy with other people and enjoy being alone.

Now with meditation, that part of my personality has become even more noticeable because now I let things go even easier than before and I recently realized that this might not be convenient when it comes to maintaining interpersonal relationships as others usually expect you to be attached to them or to miss them when they're away, for example.

I always try to show compassion to others and express verbally what they mean to me, but don't want to come of as insensitive or make them think that I don't care about them because I do.

Has anyone here experienced this? How can I make non attachment compatible with having nice relationships with people who don't value letting go as much?"
Ribeag	2021-04-23 00:09:50+00:00	I meditated 1hr today for the first time!	"I usually set a 10 minute timer to end my daily meditation, but today I decided to just try interval bells every 10 minutes and if I felt like keep going then I would. It was a quiet place in my house by a window, the sun was shining on me and I was just so comfortable. 1hr, that's crazy to me. I think I'll continue with the interval bells."
Berabouman	2021-04-22 23:55:07+00:00	"Meditation is not working too well for me, kind of ""not as advertised"""	"I'm aware that everyone's experience is different and that it won't be a one size fits all thing, and that I can't expect to see results that quickly. I have been working on it quite diligently though.

I first started meditating seriously at about age 30, a few years ago. I did sitting meditation, focusing on the breath. I could do it up to about 30mins to an hour daily without many problems. I didn't feel very much different though.

Then I read up - Jon Kabat Zinn, Mindfulness in Plain English, assorted other books. I thought they were pretty good! I even attended a few Buddhist classes taught by experienced meditators but still didn't feel that much better. Tried yoga as well. 

My last recent stint was after a sudden hospitalization a few years back. I did it with some Youtube videos, communicating with my Higher Self. Still the same schedule. Still did not feel appreciably better, if at all.

I'm feeling a little disappointed at this point because I have put in the work (months and a lot of research) I am aware as the books say that it's better to do it regularly over a long period then a lot at once, but I don't really feel any different than when I meditate or when I don't. Everyone's body is different - like my therapist says she falls asleep moments after the body scan, I can do the body scan 25 times and I don't feel any different (seriously)

I thought of asking here to gain more insight and knowledge. It may be that meditation and yoga just aren't for me (I've done classes in both, I think the teachers weren't that bad) or maybe I am doing something wrong?"
coffeeinleggings	2021-04-22 23:07:06+00:00	Tips to get back into meditation after a terrible experience with a coach?	"First time posting here but hoping I can get some good ideas! I've always loved the idea of meditation but I've struggled to actually get into a lasting habit. Last fall I hired a fitness coach- I really liked how realistic(not intense bodybuilder routine) the plan seemed and I loved that a key part of her plan was meditation. Everything was going great- I was finally meditating on a regular basis and I was seeing great results. I was a little on edge when she recommended I listen to a talk her ""mentor"" was hosting. Then she instructed me to do these recorded meditations with this mentor every day. It started going way beyond just meditation and my husband got concerned with how much of a cult it was starting to sound like. I did some research and  discovered it had been reported multiple times as a cult and that this leader was not a good guy. It was really scary- I'd heard stories about these kinds of groups but I'd never gotten recruited before or gotten this close to a situation like that. 

I know that meditation is completely separate from this encounter but I'm having a very hard time separating the two. Every time I sit down and try to mediate I can not get her out of my head and I start reliving the whole ordeal and feel more anxious and stressed than I did before I tried to meditate.

I really would like to get back into a regular meditation practice - does anyone have any ideas on how I can get past this hurtle and back into a good routine? 

Thanks in advance!"
RapidActionBattalion	2021-04-22 22:35:30+00:00	Is it better to meditate in the morning after waking up or at night before going to sleep?	I know the real answer to this question is “it depends” and there are other times in the day to meditate. But let’s say you could meditate in the morning just as easily as in the night. When would it be a better time to do it?
shimmeringHeart	2021-04-22 21:58:19+00:00	Feeling the awareness behind your back. Powerful meditation experiment.	"There is a powerful pointing instruction from Mahamudra Buddhism, that asks you to simply feel into the awareness behind your back, with eyes open and softly just looking ahead. 


Not your physical back itself, but awareness of the empty space behind your back, in the room. 


Can you feel that awareness?


Does it have a limit? See if you can extend that awareness as far behind you as you can. 


Rest your awareness in that spaciousness for a little while. What’s it like?

Darius-Mal	2021-04-22 19:54:56+00:00	Formal sitting practice vs moments of meditation throughout the day	"I believe it depends on the contemplative school of thought, but many say there's a misconception that meditation necessarily involves having a formal practice. The idea of ""insight"" means the insight is always available. When one sees through Maya (illusory nature of reality/self), then it doesn't really matter when you meditate. If you see through Maya at random, punctuated times of the day enough, you could easily be meditating a lot more than those with formal sitting down practices

That being said, I'm wondering if people who practice both styles of meditation could tell me the costs and benefits of each. Like might they differ in terms of the ways they could help anxiety? Maybe they differ in terms your moment to moment suffering, I dont' know.."
Cricky92	2021-04-22 19:49:10+00:00	Expectations and assumptions will always lead to disappointment	"You could argue with me about it (it’ll be you by yourself), you could deny it yourself , but in the end nothing expected ,nothing assumed comes out or is the the way it is expected or assumed, when we want things differently then what they are now , when we expect things to go our way and they don’t that all , when we make assumptions towards others , ourselves or even the moment itself , that’s all thinking and it’s just thinking. Which is called Overthinking and that leads to anxiety, stress, anger etc.  and you can see where that will take you."
TheWikiLeaker	2021-04-22 19:01:13+00:00	I’m beginning to understand what it is to be present	"Today, whilst meditating, it became clear to me how my perception of the world has been so negative due to the environmental conditioning of my childhood. I was always in survival mode constantly thinking people see me negatively. This is not the truth. Nobody is even thinking about me. It was just my truth that constant repetition of the same thoughts  became my perception of reality. Subconsciously acting out the same habit loops because as far the brain is concerned that ensures survival. 

So much time spent worrying about what other people think. But that thought itself is merely an illusion - what I think other people think about me does not exist. This isn’t real. 

To be fully present is to see through the illusion of thought and not let our perception be dictated by false realities."

The only two posts I could find about Twitch meditations was from [7 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1v92oz/streamed_meditation_on_twitchtv_any_interest/) and the one I made [2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/bcvufv/daily_meditation_livestream_on_twitch/). We've stopped streaming every day but I still do a weekly meditation which you can find [here](https://www.twitch.tv/meditationmind) (not here to promote myself tho!). Slowly and surely, meditation is making it's way on Twitch. I see a lot of streams about ASMR combining relaxation, but unfortunately not many meditators! Yoga is coming up as well.

I would like to point out a great streamer and meditation teacher I found doing weekly free guided meditations and answering questions about anything meditation related.

**About the stream**  
Janusz Welin is a Brooklyn NY-based mindfulness meditation teacher specializing in creativity practices, emotional and group intelligence practices as well as the ways meditation can facilitate social justice work. Janusz has nearly a decade of dedicated mindfulness practice in the insight meditation tradition. In the streams he answers questions and does a group meditation.

**Group Meditation Schedule**

Mindful Monday (11:00 am - 12:30 pm ET / 16:00 - 17:30 GMT)  
Wisdom Wednesday (11:00 am - 12:30 pm ET / 16:00 - 17:30 GMT)  
Freestyle Fridays (11:00 am - 12:30 pm ET / 16:00 - 17:30 GMT)

You will be able to find a countdown timer on the page to easily keep track of when the next event is coming up. Any questions you have you can ask on the stream!

whatisagoodlife	2021-04-22 18:15:18+00:00	Try to ignore much of how meditation is sold by meditators and meditation companies alike	"I'm tired of seeing companies describe their users as serene, blissful, calm etc. Meditation is a tool, it doesn't make you impervious to experiencing the ups and downs of life.

I've been meditating for 6 years, I've done a handful of Vipassana silent meditation retreats and I have a daily practice. Few things have been more beneficial in my life, but I find meditators and companies completely misrepresent it. I think companies exaggerate its positive effects and meditators do likewise.  They have spent their lives being good students in school and good employees at work and can't help themselves in trying to be ""good"" meditators. None of which is my business, each to their own. The problem I have is that in both the exaggeration of it affects and in the exaggeration of the depth and serenity of someone's practice, it leads people that are new at meditation to feel like they are doing it wrong or that they are bad meditators. 

The trap I see a lot of meditators fall into, and I have myself too, is that the newbie gains (for lack of a better expression) are so powerful with meditation in the first year of practicing you think this will be a consistent upward curve. You get ahead of yourself with delusions of potential enlightenment further down the track. Instead of just acknowledging this, meditators can create their own prison in fronting continued serenity, when they are most likely realising that life is still very hard, even though they're meditating. This often creates a very insincere portrayal of meditation, where you can feel someone's words and way of being are not aligned. I think non-meditators sense this and it's quite off putting.

This is compounded by the likelihood that most of us come to meditation to heal some wounds, I didn't come to it following a virtuous epiphany - I needed it. So if previously we've expressed a vulnerability to others in our suffering, now we want to show that not only have we recovered, but now we are better than ever and we can help others be better too. It leads to a lot of preaching. 

None of this is a harsh self-judgement or judgement of others, it all very human and understandable, but I don't think us preaching the virtues of meditation in our early years of practice does a lot for inviting or interesting others to meditate. There are certain behaviours that people adopt like a uniform with meditation - be it hushed voices from teachers, a sense that we have superior consciousness or awareness than others who don't meditate, that we'd be better letting go if we'd like meditation to continue helping as many people as it can."

* More willpower, discipline and motivation  

* More stamina during workout  

* Better focus while studying  

* Significantly less food craving  

* Better decision making  

* Very polite when talking to others (earlier I used to get annoyed very easily and sometimes even talk rudely. I couldn't help it most of the time, I was mentally and even physically suffering which used to irritate me easily)  

* A feeling of bliss inside, no looking for outer of happiness (like mindless Social Media scrolling, I keep my phone in other room most of the time).  

* Feel ok being alone, no need to please others. Can easily say No to things I don't want.

I feel like 80% of self-help books are redundant and only if you diligently practise meditation, you would be unconsciously doing those things. Hence I will be doubling down on my meditation sessions.

AnHonestApe	2021-04-22 14:43:49+00:00	Listen	"I in many ways consider myself a methodological naturalist mixed with eclecticism and dialetheism, as confusing as that is for many, I’m sure. But after years of self mental torture, I have been more free than ever recently because I learned to listen to something speaking inside me despite the contradictions it can create for my acceptance of methodological naturalism.

There is a certain inner voice talking to you right now. It does not speak in a human language, though you can learn to translate what it is saying into words. It speaks peace, quietness, stillness, contentment, and pure motion/action. Hearing it requires a quieting of you emotions and thoughts which come from different forms of meditation and dedication to the practice. I personally practice general mindfulness meditation for my thoughts and emotion surfing for my emotions. It wants you to listen to it speak, and that’s it. That’s how it communicates, through your passive listening. Responding may make it go away. It is constantly reiterating the point of the universe to you: relax, be at peace, be content, and simply be an object in the universe. Everything else is unneeded extra. Things will happen despite your thoughts and emotions. Progress will happen without them. In fact, you may find progress feeds off the lack of your obsessive thoughts and emotions. 

Just some thoughts recently. Whenever I forget, I’ve found myself in misery. When I remember, pure bliss, and thank this universe I’m getting better at remembering: just listen."

Beardeddude42	2021-04-22 14:12:19+00:00	Personal technique breakthrough	"Hey, I just wanted to share something I recently discovered that works very well for me and see if someone might know the name for this technique so I can read more into it. I just kinda stumbled on it while meditating. Iv done this a few times now so I know I can repeat it.

So I start with just the basic focus on the breath technique. I do this for a bit as I wait for the level of presence in the moment I need to move to the next step. I may loose myself for a while but I know eventually I'll get there.

So then the next step is to make my reaction to any sensation/experience to be notice it. 

For example in normal life if you hear an unfamiliar sound you first realise that something is new/different. Then your mind groups the related tones together into one thing (like a cars passing has whooshing from the air and a vibrating sound from the tires). I just apply this to every sensation in my total experience. I first notice that something is different then I notice what parts of my experience are that thing. This happens for everything, every thought, every feeling, every input, potentially multiple times a second. 

What the thing is doesn't matter. Another part of myself will identity it and react to it. I just do that same thing with that new reaction. I identify something is new and then notice what it consists of. Then another part of me will react and identify that and again it doesn't matter I just do the same thing again. I dont label anything, there are no words. This is just base level understanding.

I find this task way easier to focus on then my breath. With my breath its the same thing over and over and I end up drifting. With this process its always new. I can let my attention flow like it wants to I am just holding on to the process. Not as a high level thought but as a gut reaction, I have it be my method of handling reality.

If I correctly notice a sensation/experience/thought it will suddenly play well with the other parts of me and fade away. If it sticks around then generally there is another thing in my experience that is part of it I haven't identified and once I include it it will play nice and fade. Sometimes the thing is more complex and there is a core to it. The rest fades but I need to notice the thing that was supporting the thing.

The first time I did this when my timer went off I just handled it the same way. I didn't stop meditating. I just noticed the parts of my mind that reacted to it. Noticed the parts that reacted to those reactions, watched the slow train of reactions that gave the timer meaning and the slow train of reaction that tired that meaning to my purpose. And even then it took me a while to actually remember how to act. The whole thing was probably only a few seconds but I felt that I watched myself place together my whole way of being to do it. It was trippy as hell.

Hopefully I explained that well. What is this technique called and where can I learn more?"

MichieldeKoning	2021-04-22 12:48:34+00:00	What I learned from 100 hours of meditation in 10 days	"**The mind is busy**  
The  first 3 days I was in continuous pain. I never sat cross-legged, I have  never been silent for a full day, I never meditated for more than 1  hour. But my mind created the pain, not my body.  
**Reprogramming deep conditioning**  
We  are always reacting with aversion for unpleasant, or desire for  pleasant sensations. This creates an endless cycle where we’re never  happy with our current state of being.  
**Biochemical reactions everywhere**  
Whether  it is a painful, itchy, tingling, pounding, or any other sensation, I  simply learned to observe biochemical reactions in the body without  aversion or desire. Just observe.  
**Everything is temporary**  
After  a few days the pain was gone, sometimes it came back, and then it went  away. The entire body is just a bunch of atoms jumping around all the  time. I experienced that the only constant is change.  
**Experience is the teacher**  
I  have read hundreds of books about psychology, mindfulness, success and  happiness but nothing beats experience. The books made me smart, the  experience makes me wise.  
**Now is the moment**

Is there even such a thing as cheating during meditation or is it simply a matter of finding different tools for achieving the same purpose (i.e. focus), such as counting the breath or deepening it?

I wonder what your views on this are and if you have any other ""cheats"" :)

Thanks!"

Have you heard of the Grabovoi Codes?  

 🌟They are radionic signature numbers to heal various aliments. It is also used for wealth, prosperity, and success. It is similar to a visualization meditation. The [numbers are repeated](https://youtu.be/UuV4X7_hPgE) in a sequence and visualized flowing into a white sphere. 

 🌟Radionic theory is the concept that man and all life forms share a common ground and are connected within an electro-magnetic field on Earth. If this field within you is distorted it will result in disease and mental instability. Everything carries it's own particular ""number"" frequency or vibration. These numbers can be used to identify and treat disease at a distance. Grabovoi identified these unique numbers and had clients meditate on them resulting in miraculous recoveries and changes in life patterns. 

 🌟 Our idea is to spread the knowledge of how powerful numbers are and that they vibrate in a specific frequency which we can all use to our benefits. Numerology has been a part of humanity since ancient times and frequency is the language it uses.  

🌟By using these Grabovoi Mantra meditations you can put your head phones and turn the volume to a comfortable level, visualizing your desired result. By meaning ""Mantra"" is  a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation &amp; a statement or slogan repeated frequently. This is why our new series aims to help you not only listening to meditative sounds and visualizing the number but hearing it repeatedly. 

**Here are two Grabovoi Meditation Mantras you can try out - &gt;**

"Closing my eyes and focusing on my breathe feels impossible, my mind wanders constantly and I sometimes dont even realise It's wondered until deep in thought. In an opposite fashion, I instantly recognise my thoughts wandering in open eye, and I seem to be able to get in a deep meditative trance much easier. 

Anyone with similar experiences?"

"I’ve been meditating with mindfulness meditation for over five years, and this is the most mind blowing meditation I’ve ever tried *by far*. It’s quite different from breath focus and typical mindfulness meditation, but there is **an instant release out of any anxiety or mental anguish**. It takes you directly to the spacious awareness that is our true nature, literally within minutes. And stabilizing there is blissful. 

But don’t just take my word for it try it for yourself! It can literally work within minutes.

1. Sit straight (or stand straight). Head up, spine vertical (no slouching). Legs should fully touch the floor.
2. Smile. Even if you don't feel it. If you catch yourself not smiling, put the smile on again. You don't have to feel like smiling - just put the smile there.
3. Breath through your nose only.

Do this while working - it works beautifully if you're sitting in front of a screen. You should feel a calmness emanating from your belly."

Libertine74	2021-04-22 03:56:58+00:00	Sitting erect without back support? Game changer!!	"I meditated daily for over a year either laying down or stumped in a chair. Over 2 months 
 ago I started sitting straight with no support and the effects have been remarkable!  It was excruciating at first, as I have bad posture. But accepting the pain is part of the process!  I slowed worked up from 30 min to 2 hours / day.  

I am lighter, calmer, more compassionate, more present, more loving and experiencing glimpses of joy at living that I have not experienced in a very long time.  Accepting the back pain and identifying it as a “sensation” has helped me become more equanimous when dealing with strong emotions.  Why is this posture so vital?  I suspect that it might have something to do with biofeedback: our postures impact our mental states. For instance, furrowing one’s brow, even if only in response to sunlight, can signal to the brain to be on guard. What are you thoughts on this?"
TheRealVorador	2021-04-22 03:46:28+00:00	"Recommendations for Meditations to Contact ""Extraterrestrials"" Please"	"I want to be hit with the hardest stuff you got. Some background: I am looking for meditation methods/videos/audio files (guided, binaural beats, hypnosis, astral projection, remote viewing, anything goes!) to contact ""extraterrestrials"" - I put extraterrestrials in quotes because I am referring specifically to the entities known as ""the Greys"" - which I feel can best be described as more ""entities"" than ""aliens"". I say this at the risk of sounding completely 'crazy', but - I have a strange connection to these specific entities, and have had for a very long time, and I want to further explore it. 

I have experience (literally decades of it now) with these type of ""contact"" meditations specifically with these entities, and I was wondering if anyone else here has done this, or ""extraterrestrial/interdimensional entity contact"" meditations in general. I would not say that these years of experience make me 'good' at this practice by any means - but I have had experiences.

To lay it all out on the table - I'm basically talking about ""seeing through The Veil"" - I know this can be a terrifying and potentially mentally damaging experience (believe me, I do, I've been there - you will have 'lucid nightmares' for a damn good while) - but - I've already been doing this for decades and this was more something that 'found me' as opposed to me 'finding it'.

My goal is simple - see through The Veil - attempt contact - and then attempt to interpret those visions  through Automatic drawing and writing. 

As I said - I've done this before - but I want to get better at it."
abolish98	2021-04-22 03:32:55+00:00	I cannot convince myself that meditation is not just an esoteric placebo.	"Throughout the last years, I've always been interested in altered states of consciousness. Lucid dreaming for example is something that has proven to be actually working for me. I've managed to have countless lucid dreams and I do it almost instinctively nowadays. There is no doubt for me that it's actually possible.

Sadly, I cannot say the same thing about meditation. No matter if I go with or without music, with or without guidance, with or without special breathing, different posture, different times of the day, before or after eating [...] - I just don't feel any effect whatsoever.

If I had to rate my experiences in regards to how strongly they affected my mind, an LSD trip would be at 90% and lucid dreams at 75% while meditation is still an absolute 0%.

Because I've been unable to observe the slightest effect of meditation so far, I tend to believe that it's actually just a placebo. To be honest, most of the people who share their meditation stories sound like crazy water diviners to me.

How can I tell esotericism and real (?) exercises apart?

What didn't I understand yet?

Please tell me what to do. I'd really like to know how I can prove meditation to be working by actually having an experience that leaves no douts."

PariahPoet	2021-04-22 02:49:51+00:00	Simple Meditation! In ways you already know and love: For Beginners	"If you have ever ""Zoned Out"" that IS meditation. So if you're new to meditation simply begin by zoning out! If you can, try to go deeper into it. This will instantly get you into the ""zone"" aha. Of course this may seem too easy. But it really is that easy. Just zone out, then boom you're in the zone. After this simply focus on feeling. Feel your emotions and the blood flowing though your veins and arteries.

Daydreaming is also a form of meditation, simply enter the world of your dreams and let your creativity fly. Attempt to become extremely invested in the world you have created. This is extremely good for beginners. Masturbation paired with this is pretty amazing as well.

Do not try to force your mind to be clear. Let the thoughts flow in and out of you. Let them go as they leave. If you try too hard to have a clear mind, it will have the opposite effect. Simply relax and let your mind fly. Embrace the thoughts that come to you. Some of them may be important in your uh 'spiritual journey'. Thanks for your time and good luck!"

Even so, I still have to remind myself to focus on my breath. I tell myself to follow my breath....in...out...in...out and so on until I am able to find to fall away and find my happy zen space. Sometimes I follow by reminding/telling myself ""you are breathing in, you are breathing out"". When I catch myself falling into this binary and dichotomous thinking I fall back into my zen mind and remind myself all is one and one is all and so on. Well, today instead of thinking in ""you are breathing in, etc."" I  attempted to change my perspective. Kind of like switching from first person to third person. It wasn't gound changing. That being said it did feel kind of felt free. I  will try not to focus on this as I know it was just a passing moment but I do think I found a sense of peace in this. I just wanted o express this and maybe put it out in the universe and maybe hear some thoughts on others' different perspectives on this. thoughts?"

Gh0stwhale	2021-04-22 01:29:28+00:00	Books on meditation/buddhism/chakras? Books that aren't shady?	" I'm looking for a book that has information on at least one of the topics listed in the title, preferably from a reputable person in this field. 

 I liked Don't Worry Be Grumpy by Ajahn Brahm, though it was more of a book about the author's spiritual experieces, not necessarily a book about information, but I learned a lot from it, and I'm basically looking for books like that. 

 The reason I added ""books that aren't shady"" is because looking for info on the internet was so hard. Info on topics like this is often scattered across various blogs that also sell essential oils and crystals stuff. 

 And while I'm not downplaying the benefits of *essential oils and crystals and stuff*, I don't trust the blogs that value natural remedies over modern medicine. 

 oh god i strayed from the point.

 My point is, it would be great if any of yall could drop off a book recommendation or two. Thanks."

Imaginary_Lock_3421	2021-04-22 00:10:30+00:00	At a crossroads...	"I found meditation and spirituality a few years ago and was hooked, initially. I started reading anything I could and began meditating regularly. It seemed to be working on short term anger, joy and focus as well as ability to put in the work. But as time went on, it felt like my long term happiness was showing no improvement. Then I came across some books refuting meditation on the premise that by meditating, we are creating this problem of anxiety essentially by saying ""I have a problem called anxiety or lack of happiness and I will improve it by doing prescription X"". This line of thinking resonated with me at the time and since then, almost a year ago, I have not been meditating. Overall, my happiness and peace seemed to be better at times after stopping meditating, but I still find myself wondering if I should be meditating and still longing that ""enlightenment"" transformation. Anyone been in a similar position? For those interested, the books I read refuting meditation were by Kapil Gupta."

Darius-Mal	2021-04-21 23:26:41+00:00	Punctuated meditation vs formal sitting practice	"I believe it depends on the contemplative school of thought, but as you know, there's a misconception that meditation necessarily involves having a formal practice. The idea of ""insight"" means the insight is always available. When one sees through Maya (illusory nature of reality/self), then it doesn't really matter when you meditate. If you see through Maya at random, punctuated times of the day enough, you could easily be meditating a lot more than those with formal sitting down practices

That being said, I'm wondering if people who practice both styles of meditation could tell me the costs and benefits of each. Like might they differ in terms of the ways they could help anxiety? Maybe they differ in terms your moment to moment suffering, I dont' know.."
KushyyDreams	2021-04-21 22:06:18+00:00	YouTube meditation video messed me up	"Hello, I love meditating and I also like listening to binaural beats during meditation.
On Tuesday (04/13/21) I decided to watch a new video that claimed to refresh and balance all of my chakras. I did this meditation at night when I was already very tired so I fell asleep with the video still playing. 
I woke up feeling aware and different, it felt off now that I think about it. It felt like I no longer felt the energy around me. I no longer get goosebumps when I step outside, when I used to feel energy pretty easily. 
I thought this feeling would have disappeared overnight but when I woke up the next morning I still felt empty. 
It wasn’t until yesterday when I though well this is really bad. So I worked on my root chakra mainly and I also stayed outside barefoot to really soak in the earths vibration. I feel like everything is coming back slowly.
I wouldn’t want to go through something like that again. Has anyone ever felt off like this before?"
UnChienDEspace	2021-04-21 21:23:07+00:00	Dissociation by meditation	"Hi all

While I'm typing this, I'm dissociating as a result of a short meditation. It's quite scary, and I'm hoping someone could give me some insight in why this happens and how to deal with this.

Background:  
I'm not new to meditation. I've done two 10-day vipassana retreats and have been meditating on and of for years (be it not very often or regular: let's say I have a total milage of 500 hours). Never dissociated before.  


Four days ago something scary happened while I was trying some technique I am experimenting with. The first time I used this technique was in the retreat, and I had the most happy, most empowering meditation because of it. What I do is this: instead of doing the Goenka-bodyscan, I feel the whole body at once. Then I try to get 'behind' the feelings / put my awareness on them. Then I notice some gross tensions. I put my awareness on them, and let them go. I keep repeating for every tension. These tensions get smaller en smaller, until only some small twitches come up. I let them go. What happens then is that my consciousness kind of shifts, I can feel it happening, like an elevator taking off. Usually this leads to a very clear, bright experience.  


Now four days ago, I was in bed at night. I decided to do this technique. Halfway I remembered a scary story about someone who had a bad trip with an Out-Of-Body experience where a scary man was standing next to his bed. I got scared thinking of this. Decided to still keep doing the technique. Even though I was so scared, somehow I managed to have the shift in consciousness. But I guess that in the moment when the shift happened, I was expecting to have this scary man appear next to my bed. He didn't appear of course, but still I've never been so scared as I was then. My chest was pumping, my eyes were uncontrollably twitching, and some energy was running up my spine. I decided to try and stay calm, keep my awareness on the body. I wasn't sure if would be able to break the 'trance', or be able to move. This thought scared me further. I think I held on for 30-ish seconds before I couldn't hold it anymore and decided to move. This broke the 'trance'.  


I didn't sleep no more that night. It's possible that I was dissociated the rest of the night, somehow I don't remember anymore. The next day I was fine, like it was just a bad dream. However, in the evening I started spontaneously dissociating. I was scared again, but managed to get a few hours sleep. Next day fine again. So I started thinking that it had to do something with the evening/night. And sure enough: by nightfall, while I was still actively doing work on the pc, I started dissociating out of nowhere. No sleep that night, because I wasn't sure if it was safe to stop resisting the dissociating feeling in the back of my head that was pulling me away. So I resisted it all night. Fell asleep in the morning. But this time the dissociating wasn't gone when I woke up.   


So at that point I decided that it had nothing to do with day- or nighttime. I decided I was just freaking myself out, scaring myself so badly to the point of trauma, hence the dissociating. Next day was better. And now I am here, I thought I'd go back to meditation, but it's triggered it again. Even though I was strictly adhering to the ""The Mind Illuminated"" techniques for Stage 3 - 4.  


I have no idea how to deal with this!"
goody-two-sneakers	2021-04-21 21:01:29+00:00	Guided Meditation Recommendations?	"I’m still getting into the swing of meditating. I want to have a more daily practice and I’m looking for an app or podcast or YouTube channel that I can rely on as my daily go-to while I’m still learning which techniques work best for me. 

I’ve been using Balance (specifically the foundations course), but I’m not in love with the basic training and the limited duration (5 or 10 minutes). 

I’m looking for something more spiritual: working with chakras, grounding, clearing negativity, energizing, etc. More on the hippie side than the breathwork-focused side.

I prefer 15-30 minute guided meditations. 

Does you have a go-to app, podcast, or YouTube channel that you can recommend?"
McInSlosh	2021-04-21 20:59:50+00:00	I never thought about it.	"So , I am not your typical meditation-type-of-guy. None of my friends have considered it, and I would have never tried, if it weren’t for my best friend killing himself. 

I take 2 weeks off of college. Tell all my instructors I need personal time , whatever the cost. I start smoking tons of weed, drinking my face off and basically crying myself to sleep for a couple nights. And then I ask myself “why did he do it” obviously , I couldn’t find an answer, so I realize I’m going to have to move on. But how? 

I think it was a YouTuber Actualized.org , bald guy , who first gave me insight on how to start. 

I didn’t want a fucking happy go lucky guy to tell me it’s all going to be alright , I just wanted some instruction. 

So I found a technique that worked for me in my darkest hour. It was simple enough , cross your legs , sit up straight , and literally don’t move a muscle. 

Try for as long as you can , when I first started I couldn’t last more than 30 seconds or a minute before I had to scratch an itch or re adjust my position. But as I went on I could sit still for minutes, and up to a half hour and once I did 45 minutes. 

The idea was basically if you can resist an itch , it will pass. You don’t need to scratch it, it was true, second point was that what are you doing ? Your doing nothing. In my mind is the basis of meditation. You are blocking everything out and focusing on the noise within yourself.

Talking about breathing , I got frustrated with focusing on breathing techniques, so I let my body breath naturally, and after some time you won’t have to think about it. 

Getting into deeper stuff here, I always pictured 1 of two things when meditating, I am very visual , so this was easy for me, 

1 :
your mind is a sky, every thought coming through is a cloud, some last a long time , some are dark and scary , others are pleasant, light a fluffy. But the main point is that they do pass , allow the thoughts to come in and out, you can get lost in a thought sure 

“ thinking about my dog, why I love her, why I hate her, what made me think of the dog ? Oh wait ok clouds , do I want it to pass ?? Meh her coat has such a wonderful color ... “ but allow new ones to come. 

2 : mind is a lake , birds eye view so u can see the coast and the shore , personally I always think of a mirror sheet of water , thoughts are ripples , how long will they go ? Will the bounce off the coast and reciprocate back into a tidal wave ? No. It’s a lake , thoughts will settle and your surface will return to a mirror like sheen, until of course a new thought or “ripple” comes through. 

Let the thought pass so a new one can come in. This is what meditation is for me , allowing thoughts to come in and manifest and go into a deeper train of thought is fine, as long as you let them go and accept new ones. 

Helped me come to realization to what was in front of me, become more aware of my emotions and how I express them. There are a ton of hidden meanings in my previous words so I won’t continue , anyways hope that helps 🤘🍻"

What does this mean is this normal in the beginning and I just need to persist ? Or something else ?
6joeNATHANcarder9	2021-04-21 18:10:06+00:00	Severe panic attack mid session	I started meditating a while ago (18m btw) and I go up in time 30 seconds every few days. I'm at 15 minutes right now about 12 minutes in I had an extreme panic attack. I couldn't really move and my vision got blurry and wavy. I tried to just observe it and did for about 40 seconds before it got to be too much. I fully opened my eyes and started breathing really hard which fixed it and I went back to meditating. Can anyone tell me why this happened?

Not only that but it becomes stronger than gravity since you cant defy it. Your grandpa could be knocking and suddenly your having a full blown UFC fight with a body part. 

After meditating with the monks at vipassana, my body was starting to defy gravity in the same way since i wasnt forcing it down. Let go of your boner man."

Our talks and meditations are based on powerful Tibetan Buddhist mind training techniques that use imagination, emotions, and critical inquiry to probe our inner and outer realities and expand our compassion. 

As the host, I'm trying to bring the inner science of Buddhist meditation to twenty-first century people hungry for happy, meaningful lives, with my producing partner Stephen Butler.

Our first  episode is a great place to start: [Episode 1: What is A Skeptic's Path to Enlightenment?](https://www.skepticspath.org/podcast/1-what-is-a-skeptics-path-to-enlightenment/)

And this week's episode [""Alone Together""](https://www.skepticspath.org/podcast/episode-13-guided-meditation-alone-together/) addresses the dual problems of people sheltering in place, some of them feeling very lonely, while others overwhelmed with the constant presence of their families and roommates.

We'd love to get feedback from anyone interested in this type of secular meditation inspired by science and the challenges of the modern world.

twatsup	2021-04-21 15:26:42+00:00	I feel like I’ve lost my personality after 2 years of meditating almost daily and learning more about Buddhism. Looking for some new perspective.	"I’ve been feeling really empty inside lately, almost robotic in going through day to day life. I feel as though my personality is gone and I’m just a sort of ghost. 

I’m sure much of it has to do with a year of being isolated and interacting with others mainly online (I’ve been working from home for over a year now). But, I’ve been feeling like my meditation practice has something to do with it too. After letting go of thoughts and feelings, whether they’re good or bad, what else is there?

I know meditation is supposed to spark more joy in the day to day, but it all feels so mundane. I’ve lost interest in socializing and generally just don’t really know who I am anymore. 

Is this an ego trick? Am I just overthinking everything or taking it too seriously?

My best guess is to keep going and see what happens, join a local meditation center and find a sangha again when it’s safe to meet in person (so soon!), but I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this and has a different perspective to share. I love a good reading recommendation!"
_Comrade_Tito_	2021-04-21 15:24:42+00:00	I've just meditated for the first time	"So I've been thinking about this whole meditation thing for the longest time now but I've never actually tried it out,and so I've decided that today is the day I'd give it a try.

I looked up a youtube video on meditation and how to do it (I'll link the video in the comments if I can) ,and I'd like some input and preferably any suggestions on videos or blogs that could help me get a better understanding.

Anyway the way I went about it was I placed a few objects around me so that they were in my peripheral vision (I've seen a post on here about how this improves focus),I set an alarm to go off in about 5 minutes then I sat,crossed my legs,placed my arms in a comfortable position,and just breathed slowly.

I tried to keep my mind clear of thoughts by focusing on my breathing,but I stil had a few thoughts pop in here and there.What surprised me the most was how quickly it was all over,I expected it would feel like an eternity.

Anyways I'd like some suggestions as I'm pretty much new to this entire thing."
Leading-Blueberry-31	2021-04-21 14:23:37+00:00	How would I get over the dread of disappointment when attempting to complete work? I stress such a great amount over the task/project that it prevents me from beginning it.	"At the point when I was an understudy, I struggled to think and tackle my tasks efficiently particularly bunch projects. I realized what to do yet I had no certainty at all and my fixation range was extremely low in view of the constant and redundant considerations and stresses in my psyche. I couldn't control or stop my concerns. I had plenty of inquiries, for example, am I doing it right? What on the off chance that I come up short? How might my partner see me? Will they like me? Imagine a scenario where I bomb them. 

My concerns were extremely negative and I was unable to center by any means. Now and again I had this sensation of sadness and wanted to surrender. The most exceedingly terrible thing is, I have consistently accepted my concerns, that they may occur. In any case, they won't ever occur... Despite that, I actually stressed. 

One day I went over where they encourage contemplation and I select and start to ponder. My contemplation educator gave me the strategy for discarding the human psyche, which comprises karma(life lived), propensities, and body. On account of the human brain, that is the reason I had every one of these concerns and couldn't focus well on any undertaking, particularly at school. 

After pondering altogether and earnestly for some time, I understood that these concerns were bogus and they were simply encounters of my past occasions. I was alleviated and my concerns were totally gone. Hence I would now be able to focus well on a solitary assignment, do it well with no psychological deterrent, work truly and well with others without stress. 

So I will share a short video that will assist you with seeing how reflection can assist you with conquering the concerns and dread of disappointment."

"I’m not afraid of escalators, but whenever I go inside a shopping center I feel like there’s a strong electricity imbalance around escalators, and feel static kinda building up in the environment, my clothes and my skin. Specially during winter months when I’m wearing long coats and heat/static/humidity starts building up inside my clothes, I kinda feel a bit of a sensory overload. Been feeling it my entire life, but only recently been able to understand what that uneasy feeling actually is, feels like walking into a different slightly uncomfortable magnetic field."

vikas0o7	2021-04-21 12:44:55+00:00	Don't stop meditating even in best of your times when you think you don't need it.	"I used to meditate regularly and the months of meditation really  benefited me. But then slowly, I started slacking off, telling myself that I feel good anyway, everything is going well, so I don't need to meditate. Few months down the line, I think that was a huge blunder on my part to slack off. Now, I am suffering from stress(work, family related) on daily basis, my routine has become shit,  but now I can't bring myself to sit and meditate. Also, **I have realised that it is much harder to meditate when you really need it.** It is much easier when you are in good state of mind to continue doing it. So, I would like to reiterate to my  fellow mates that please don't stop meditating. Make it part of your daily routine. The benefits conveniently surpass the time and effort you put into it."

pythasaurus	2021-04-21 11:25:15+00:00	After 1 month I had what may have been my first 'breakthrough'. Would appreciate insight.	"About a month ago, I went through a pretty bad breakup. I've constantly been riddled by thoughts about how I could've been a better guy or did things differently. Constantly wondering why I wasn't accepted. Long story short, I found meditation to help me deal with it. My sessions are generally 20-30 minutes, simply focusing on the breath. If I have a lot of time, I will meditate for an hour. If I'm busy or feeling lazy, I will meditate for 5 minutes and get back on track the next day.

Fast forward to today, after a month of meditating, towards the end of my hour-long session I was overcome with a sense of euphoria. I felt like I finally made contact with my 'true self', unpolluted by anything external. I suddenly felt no pressure to be accepted by others because I finally accepted myself. Tears rolled down my face at this realization and I let go of past regrets. I truly felt that those no longer a part of my life are missing out, but I felt no animosity toward them and wished them the best. This feeling only lasted for 30 seconds or so before external thoughts flooded my mind again and I lost touch with my true self.

If this is what meditation has to offer, I am extremely glad I took it up. I cannot wait to see what more this world has to offer. I'm still curious, what did I experience? Have others experienced the same?"

What can I do to stop that. I try to get it away but it’s still there. As if I’m sitting with my head down on my knees and this presence with negativity taking over. I have been diagnosed with depression anxiety bipolar and PTSD since i was 10 I’m 21 now I’ve gotten help for 8 yrs but stopped because nothing was working. I heard meditating helps with anxiety and finding yourself but I just can’t fully meditate when my anxiety is so high."

But now its getting warm and I've started meditating outdoors with a lotus position. 5 minutes in, my back starts to hurt. I try fix my position, but now I can feel how my legs are being stressed by trying to balance my weight. As the weight distribution between my entire upper body and my legs arent even. If i lean forwards a bit to balance the weight and rest my legs, my back hurts again :(

How did you guys learn your lotus position? And any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!"

DavidMc843	2021-04-21 07:43:44+00:00	A Gentle Reminder	"Meditation is a learned skill.  It is an exceedingly rare individual that “gets it” as soon as they start.  Just like any skill, it takes time, dedication, and instruction to develop.  No one goes from learning the ABCs to reading on a college level in a week.  No one picks up a ball and is being recruited by pro scouts a month later.  And like any other skill, sometimes you will progress quickly, sometimes it takes maximum effort just to keep from regressing.  So, take it easy, be gentle and kind with yourself, and congratulate yourself from time to time.  May you be happy, well, and at peace."

I have a history of ankle injuries. Went to a podiatrist and he recommended surgery on both ankles to repair the shredded ligaments. I had the procedure done on one ankle, but the jury is still out on whether I prefer the surgically repaired side or the natural side.  
  
Anyway, I will probably never be able to get into full lotus. Even when I was young and flexible enough to do, it would literally dislocate my ankles. So no full lotus for me. Half lotus doesn't really feel right either, so I tried cross legged, but my feet fall asleep when I meditate that way. Then I watched a YouTube video where a guy explained how to do burmese position, with both heels in front of the pubic bone, and knees touching my zabuton. It was very stable, I liked it. It did give quite a stretch on my ankles, but no worries about my ankles popping out like lotus. And there was some pain getting out of it because of the stretch, but the pain went away quickly after.  
  
All of this to say: what do.you guys think of burmese position? I think I will alternate between burmese and cross legged. I don't really want to use a chair, though I might try a seiza later."

aFiachra	2021-04-21 06:28:59+00:00	Do you know how all email shows up as high priority? Thoughts are like that too	"I had a good meditation yesterday and the thought occurred to me, “thoughts that arise in meditation always claim that they are super important and that isn’t really true.” So far I have not had the thought, “the house is on fire” or “I hear an intruder” — I have been lucky. But every thought that does show up while meditating has that level of urgency. “Dude, you have to get up now and remember to organize the groceries! You have to make that call about that book that you lent to that guy! You have to post something on social media about lint! Squirrel!”

Thoughts never show up and ask if I have a moment.   I feel like this is one of those things that might be common as I “detox” from overthinking and I wonder what everyone else’s experience has been like with this."

Like watching a emotional episode for example, or connecting with another person deeper than id imagine.

I feel there pain but not the actual pain. 

How do I see the unseen that’s already seen more than this? Is there more to emotion than i think i know that I already do? 

At this point I don’t even make sense to myself."

gosha_levin	2021-04-21 00:04:17+00:00	My experience of organizing a 7-day solo meditation retreat	"I dreamed about going to retreat for a long time, but COVID has ruined my plans. So I decided to organize a solo retreat. I've spent wonderful 7 days that I believe changed my life.

I've rented a simple tiny cabin in the forest 3 hours drive from the city. I intentionally took a minimal amount of simple food: mostly rice and frozen veggies. I took an old cell phone without internet. 

Every day I meditated for 1-2 hours. I was sitting on the porch and looked at the forest for 1-2 hours. Also, I walked in the forest and read books. 

My task was to be fully present: to live here and now instead of in the past or the future. I was doing everything very slowly, focusing on everything I was doing. It felt like meditation: making the bed, taking slow showers, walking. 

Also, I wanted to feel my body better, so I tried to eat minimum food. Usually two small balls of veggies and rice every day. I did it because I realized that food to me was escaping from my reality. I could eat to feel something good instead of being with myself which often felt uncomfortable.  I decided for 7 days to use food only as a source of energy to be less distracted. It helped. Every bite felt so delicious, and I could feel my body better on a half-empty stomach. 

After 3 days without internet and with limited food, I started to feel joy just from being. It was nice and felt more consistent than happiness. I realized that happiness depends on conditions and the joy of living is something that I can keep inside forever regardless of circumstances.

After 7 days, something happened inside me... I've read many books about consciousness and awareness, but I think I understood what all these books were about only after this 7-day retreat. 

When I got back home, I felt calm and peaceful. My friends didn't know about my retreat. When I met them, they told me something changed in my face, like I looked happier—also, my relationship with my girlfriend impoved.

It's been 4 months since my retreat. I still feel this joy. 

I decided to write this for those who also want to attend a retreat but postpone it due to logistic problems.  Apparently, you can do it solo."

What are techniques or traditions out there? I learned about open eye walking meditations from a Metta retreat. I heard that the Zen tradition is done with eyes pointed down and slightly open. What are some others that you know of?

I’m particularly interested in open eye meditation because they really seem to resonate with me. Years ago, as an experiment I tried an open eye meditation with my gaze at a fixed point. I felt like I was able to get to a point of clear deep focus quickly and it didn’t get a bit trippy with the visuals. I’d like to explore it more."

"I’m a 17 year old male that is interested in everything health, and so I’ve meditated a handful of times but never made a serious practice out of it. Here’s the thing, every time I meditate things become « weird ». Things, my view, goes in and out constantly, if I open my eyes while this is happening I can’t tell how far away things are or the size of objects at all. My perception is completely messed up, if I hold this state for longer I feel like I am floating, as if there is nothing around me. Can anyone tell me what is going on? Side note; when I meditate I usually scratch my nose and then focus on my nose, I focus on a part of my body and really feel it. When I am very focused everything starts.

All answers are appreciated! Thanks my monk friends"

"First of all, if I don't feel that strain in meditation, after that I dont feel like relieved or comfortable. It starts like middle or end of my meditation. I m focusing my breath but after little time I just start to focus on thinking nothing and that is the where strain feeling starting in my brain. While I feel that I am not uncomfortable but it is kinda confusing for me. Is that how we start to relax or am I doing something wrong?"

magentaorenge	2021-04-20 20:54:53+00:00	Finding that letting go of stress is... Stressful 😩	"I just finished the 10th day of headspace's ""letting go of stress track"" and I feel very different. I feel my breathing is much more deep and I even feel almost uncomfortably light. It makes sense  why I would be feeling this way as I consider myself a high stress person, but still the effects are so portent they are almost jarring.

I've had other experiences where things that should be good for you leaves you with some insecurity and are even stressful in it's own right; In the example above, I can't help but believe that the stress kept me alert and ready--letting it go would mean letting go of a defense mechanism.
I'm not saying I'm going to stop diving deeper into this area of my practice; it's just that the water is a little too hot for me, and I'm acclimating as I continue to lower myself into the tub.

Any one have a similar story?"

All that we are searching or looking for can be found within ourselves if   we direct the right attention toward what we call Self. In the Sufi   tradition, one of the avenues to reach what is being searched is   gratitude. In this workshop, Shaykh Burhanuddin talks about different   ways of practicing gratitude and its benefits for deepening our daily   practice.

RSVP at [https://www.inner-craft.com/event/the-magic-of-thankfulness/](https://www.inner-craft.com/event/the-magic-of-thankfulness/)

Shaykh  is a contemporary mystic of ancient tradition, called onto the Sufi   path at a young age. In his teaching, Shaykh combines methods from his   Sufi Tradition with contemporary knowledge of psychology. He started the   practice at 10 with Yoga, and between the ages of 14-18 practiced   meditation under the guidance of the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje,   within the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. At 18, Shaykh met   with the grandmaster of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order, one of the most   ancient and authoritative of the many existing Sufi Orders, Mawlana   Shaykh Nazim al Haqqani ar Rabbani, and went through the classic dervish   training under the direct guidance of the Master. He received a direct   transmission of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order. Shaykh is the author of  three  books, a musician and the founder of the Dervish Orchestra."

sheyrak	2021-04-20 17:03:45+00:00	"Being aware of other peoples presence, makes me stiff?"	"Hey,

I've probably got a weird question here, but please bear with me.

First of all... I am currently in a new working environment and I've been kinda stiff/more shy/awkward than I thought I am... and the ""new environment"" isnt ""that new"" anymore... so it made me think about the reason.

I came to the conclusion that I am always aware of other people in the same room as me. And this is kinda distracting me. Especially when there are more people in the room (and I am sober/not super tired), it kinda distracts me... For example in a small ""group"", small enough that everybody hears everything, but big enough that there are individual topics being talked about, it feels like my brain is lagging behind. I am aware of so many auditive, spatial (relative positions of each other), body language and other informations, that I am less eloquent than I am in smaller groups. As if my brain lags... and my awareness of it only makes it worse.

I feel like this has to do with meditation. The practices I tend to do, are often related to spreading the awareness out in some way. (i.e. concentrating on my ears/auditive signals, my skin, my breath, ""the silent observer Cthulhu"", etc.)

So, what should I do with this ""conclusion""? Try to ignore other people around me? Sounds like a bad idea to me.

Is it normal for me to find the choiceless awareness meditation easier than the traditional object of attention meditation?

I was doing the class which involved a transition from meditation focusing on breathing, to choiceless awareness and then back to meditation attentive on breathing. I noticed that once I had done the choiceless awareness part and was directed to transition back to breathing meditation i felt an unease at adjusting and i even found it harder to focus on my breathing than on nothing at all."
SeaDevelopment7075	2021-04-20 16:25:00+00:00	I think I need your help: Sharing my weird experiences	"Hey there, 

Im texting this, right after my meditation, but first, a little bit to my current situation:

Like probably everyone, I’ve been hit by the pandemic very hard.

Lately, I feel exhausted, like I have never felt in my life before: studies, work, and so on. It feels like I’m just about to burn out; but I can still hold it together and I’m not burned out (yet!). 

Anyway, I have tried to meditate with a mantra for 20 minutes per day, mostly before I go to bed. I tried it few months ago, then stopped, now again since 5 days. 
It helps me to get rid of all the stressful thoughts. 
(I haven’t been to a TM Professional as I believe it is a scam and please spare me the “go to a TM Practicioner” answers.) 

I believe I am in a very nice and relaxed state while I meditate, but I don’t know, if I am in “transcendence” or the “bliss” everyone is talking about?

How do I know, is my first question. Here are some weird experiences I make and maybe some of you have had the same :)

Sometimes I feel that my head feels very,
very light and tilts back. It’s a nice feeling, but it doesn’t happen all the time. 

A lot of times, I feel pain on my forehead and my temples, I don’t know If I do something wrong or my eyes are in a wrong position when closed? It’s the same pain as if I would squint. So weird, what the he’ll is that? Is it my pain of exhaustion or do I do something wrong? 

And one experience which I am very curious about is, that my facial muscles start to contract very, very fast and my lips begin to tip and I’m having a “kiss mouth”. 
I really don’t know what’s going on. Maybe the experiences of this community can help me to put things in order. 

I am very curious about your answers and wish a wonderful day. 

Namaste."
xTrainerRedx	2021-04-20 16:18:07+00:00	Don't bother arguing with people.	"Posting this here because I have come to respect this community.

I recently responded to a post about the Law Of Attraction im another sub and shared my experiences with such concepts. Unfortunately the post attracted a lot of negativity from people who were using science to discount what we were saying and call it ""bullshit"".

If you have ever experienced something similar. Use it as an opportunity to grow stronger in your practices. See the negative vibes they are bringing to the situation, and see your ego flare up with desire to argue back and disprove them. You will likely never change their minds.

The irony of the situation is that they were saying negative comments about the LoA, which only attracted more negativity. So if they could see beyond their own mind-driven principles, they would have been able to see the LoA in action.

Never shame your own faith. Even many atheists have faith in their cold, hard facts based in science; yet spit in the face of concepts like *faith* &amp; *meditation*. I respect the applications of science myself, but I am also aware of its limitations and that there are many things it cannot (and may never) be able to explain. My faith picks up where science leaves off.

Stay aware, everyone. See your minds. See your egos. Use meditation and mindfulness practices to access deeper levels of awareness, and make the conscious choice to swim with the flow of life even if it takes you into challenging situations. From there, respond from a place of acceptance and inclusion, not exclusion.

🙏"

sainz9702	2021-04-20 14:25:01+00:00	Ghosts	"“If you cannot pass through the barrier and exhaust the arising of thoughts, you are like a ghost clinging to the trees and grass.” Ghosts do not appear openly in the daytime, but come out furtively after dark, it is said, hugging the earth or clinging to willow trees. They are dependent upon these supports for their very existence. In a sense human beings are also ghostlike, since most of us cannot function independent of money, social standing, honor, companionship, authority; or else we feel the need to identify ourselves with an organization or an ideology. If you would be a man of true worth and not a phantom, you must be able to walk upright by yourself, dependent on nothing. When you harbor philosophical concepts or religious beliefs or ideas or theories of one kind or another, you too are a phantom, for inevitably you become bound to them. Only when your mind is empty of such abstractions are you truly free and independent."
shalom1961	2021-04-20 14:19:39+00:00	Meditation:The greatest expression of being Human.	"&amp;#x200B;

Think about it for a moment. 

What does it really mean to be Human?

And once we know what it means to be Human, how can we express our uniqueness in the best and highest way?

I suppose you would get different answers depending on who you asked.

Biologists and Chemists would probably give you different answers and insights than a Philosopher or a Spiritual Leader would.

They are all valid in their own way.

I believe that a Human Being’s ability to ponder, to wonder, to seek, to attempt to connect to the Divine, to long for connection with self, to pause, to listen, is Life’s ultimate gift to us as a Species.  We are blessed with the gift, the ability to access all the awe of the Universe, the marvels of existence, our own unique selves,  just by stopping for a few minutes, breathing, opening up to the moment, becoming aware, truly Be-ing in our true nature.

In other words, Meditating.

Mediation allows us to experience our time as  Human Be-ings, not Human Doi-ngs."

I am still scatter brained, both on and off of the cushion, but there is definite progress being made.

I am facing a challenge currently.

As I meditate more, I understand that our experience of life comes from within.  

I am slowly but surely removing or cutting back on my vices; alcohol, excessive internet/social media use, sugar, smoking etc.  I see how these keep me stuck in a loop in life,  as I use them as coping tools; for boredom, comfort, avoiding negative emotions.  But I can see how excessively using these vices never allows be to deal with discomfort or my own issues.  

But as these vices drop off, I feel …… I can’t really explain it.  

A sense of emptiness?

I want to keep soothing myself with these things.

But I don’t.

I know if I keep using them I will only prolong this feeling.

But if I don’t use them I have to face this feeling.

It may be emptiness.  It may be something else.  But this truth seems to be coming clearer by the day."
byayush	2021-04-20 13:34:14+00:00	Just finished a 3-day silent meditation course - Meditated 10 hours per day - Vipassana	"An exhausting yet liberating experience. I went to a 3-day Vipassana course and sharing more about the technique and my experience. 

I went for my first 10-day Vipassana course 4 years ago and left on the 6th day. It was extremely hard and I was not prepared for it. Meditating 10 hours a day is no joke. I realized the value of the teachings and decided I would return. 

## But first, what exactly is Vipassana?

Vipassana, which means seeing things as they really are, is one of the world’s most popular meditation techniques. Discovered by Gautama Buddha, it is being taught for more than 2500 years as a universal remedy for all ills (i.e. an “Art of Living”).

In simple terms, it means learning how to control your mind. It is a way of self-transformation, an exploratory journey that, upon completion, results in a balanced mind full of love and compassion. 

## How does the course work?

The technique of Vipassana is taught in 10-day courses all over the world. The principal teacher is Shri S.N. Goenka (Late). All the sessions are his Audio / Video recordings. There are centers all over the world and there is no charge – everything is provided free of cost. The organization is run by donations from old students. It is also non-sectarian and people from all faiths and backgrounds are welcome.

A typical day at the center is a constant loop of **EAT-SLEEP-MEDITATE x repeat**. It might sound fun and easy, but trust me it’s not a retreat, it’s probably one of the hardest things you will do in your life. 

Basic guidelines for the course:   


* Noble silence- which means silence of body, speech, and mind. You are not allowed to speak or communicate in any form for 10 days. (except with the teacher/servers)  

* No reading or writing. No digital devices, of course.   

* Abstain from eating after mid-day. You get two meals; Breakfast at 6:30 and Lunch at 11, followed by tea with fruits at 5, all vegetarian (the meals are delicious).   

* Meditate 10 hours a day for 10 days. 

  
After continuing experimenting with different techniques and apps (calm, headspace, waking up, open eye meditation, TM, etc.), I felt Vipassana would work best in the long term and I finished my 10-day course in 2019. 

The first few days are rough. It takes time to get adjusted to the schedule but in the end, it is so worth it. 

Vipassana is not an escape from the daily trials and tribulations of life, it is, indeed, a way to deal with these trials and tribulations. It is an art of living. Days later after the course, I felt calmer, more grounded, and more in touch with myself. 

At both the courses, I felt a lot might happen while I’m away and how much I will miss out on. I thought about countless emails that might need my attention, missed calls and messages from my friends, and just things happening all over the world. But the reality is far from imagined. Being “off-grid” for 11 days had no impact whatsoever on the happenings of the world. The world doesn’t fall apart while you’re not paying attention to it. 

Today, nearly all of us suffer from anxiety, frustration, and discontent, and this was an opportunity to see what causes me anger and what makes me light up, and then eventually realizing this is all impermanent. 

If you’ve read this far, I highly recommend you give it a go. It’s one of the most challenging yet fulfilling things I’ve done in my life. Maybe it’s not for you, maybe it’ll do wonders for you, you’ll never know unless you try. 

My only advice is to be compassionate to yourself. It’s easy to judge your progress and being on hard on yourself. Adjust your expectations, take more breaks if you need, and have fun in the process. 

Remember, this is all about showing yourself you can do it, so the key isn’t to be perfect, but to simply *improve*. The author who writes one page a day has written a book after a year. The meditator who gets slightly better every week is a totally changed person a year later. I’m still a wretched meditator, but I’m better than I was 2 years ago and I’m hopeful about the future. 

Note: 3-day courses are only for old students. So you need to finish a 10-day course first."

UnderwaterDialect	2021-04-20 05:03:51+00:00	I'm struggling to navigate a sort of fatalism I see in mindfulness.	"A common message I see in mindfulness is not to try and change anything, but to just let it be and experience it. I struggle with this because it feels a bit fatalistic to me, like we shouldn't strive towards happiness or positive outcomes. Here are to examples.

1. Let's say I notice I am feeling sad. After I've allowed myself to feel it for a moment, and explored the feeling, is it ""wrong"" then do something that I think will lift my mood? Is that trying to change it instead of just experiencing it?

2. Let's say I am talking to someone and I can feel the conversation sagging a bit. Sometimes when I notice this I can get myself into a certain headspace where I am more in the moment and more focused on the other person, and this sometimes brings the energy of the conversation back up. Again here, is this ""wrong""? Is it wrong to try and improve the current situation?

I'm struggling to understand where to draw the line between ""just letting it be and feeling it"", and acting in a way to improve the current situation/mood.

Thank you!"

I let my hands ebb and flow making a ball of energy larger and smaller as I feel it should be and when Im finished I like to thank the sun for all that it does, and when I opened my eyes and looked down at my palms I could see beams of light reflecting off of my thumbs.

 It was an experience that lasted only a second, but thinking back to this morning, my eyes are watering."

But anyways, I have had trouble accepting pain. When I hold onto my awareness for very long pain starts to pop up everywhere in my body and it's hard to fully accept it in the moment. It is extremely uncomfortable. I resist it and get angry at it. 

But I need to to through it so I can enjoy every moment. I'm tired of the uncontrollable babbling nonsense. It's not me. Thanks"

Sad_Fold_2411	2021-04-20 01:10:18+00:00	A thought	"This is my first ever post on Reddit so please forgive me if this is not the place or something that does not belong.

I used to dabble in meditation about a decade ago. I found myself to be happier and all around more peaceful. Years later after life and responsibilities started to pile up, I found myself slipping back into old ways of thinking, as well as getting angrier easier and more annoyed at things I knew shouldn’t annoy me.

I have tried to get back into it, and of course my mind always continues to run around. I recently started trying to listen to every sound around me, and I live in a metropolitan area, so there are plenty. Still my mind moves into thoughts that I know are of a lower vibration. I’ve always been interested in politics and economics yet within the past few years have tried to get away from it. No matter how hard I try to shut out certain thoughts that I don’t want to think about while trying to center myself, I’m learning the more I listen, the easier they are to navigate and move through. 

The more I listen, even if a thought of my personal interests pop up, I’m finding it easier to transcend the interest itself and find what drives that interest. Going deeper into what drives the thought itself and not trying to shut it out has been very liberating. And I can open my eyes with a grin and peace on my face. I’m so excited to continue this journey that I’ve just restarted! It is an indispensable tool to be able to navigate ones mind and I look forward to reading all the tips and stories on this page as a way of furthering my practice. 

Thank you for a place to write what was on my mind, and again I apologize if this is not the place, but it seemed fitting. Much love! ✌️"

DavidMc843	2021-04-20 00:45:13+00:00	The Hinderances	"Anyone who sits down with intent to meditate will come face to face with the Hinderances.  They are:  sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and anxiety, and doubt.  They are often seen as obstacles to the practice.  But in reality, recognizing and remedying them IS the practice.  No one is immune.  So, if you’re dealing with one or all of these in your practice, you are actually practicing.  Give yourself some credit for having at least that much mindfulness and insight.  It can be very difficult to recognize them as they manifest in a variety of ways and intensities.  A qualified teacher is invaluable in learning how spot and deal with them."

Suspicious_Plant4231	2021-04-20 00:02:54+00:00	I don't feel like I'm doing it right	"The majority of my ""meditation"" so far has been me sitting on my bed (which I've recently discovered is discouraged) and either listening to meditative music and observing my thoughts and reflecting or me just sitting there in silence and trying to focus as much as I can on what I hear and feel. 

I used to sit outside and either listen to nature or listen to tibetan bowls until roaches and bugs came and ruined it all lol. 

Anyway, I feel like I need to change what I'm doing in order to go deeper and really improve my focus. That said, I really dislike deep breathing. I don't mind focusing on normal breath, but when it comes to controlling my breath and breathing as deeply as I can, it's never gotten me anywhere other than feeling uncomfortable. I don't have anxiety or anything, but I can't pinpoint exactly why I don't like it. Is it because I don't like it that I should do it? I'll sit in an ice cold shower and focus on my normal breath, and I've sat completely still for an hour while drops of water fell on my head and rolled down my skin and made it itch. If I can do that, surely I can breathe. 

It was once suggested that I dedicate several hours one day to meditation, and I'm pretty tempted to do it. I feel like it's something I need to do to reach a better understanding of myself. 

Does anyone have any tips? I don't think the time I'm dedicating to this practice is being used as well as it could."
SamathaTRUTH	2021-04-19 23:16:53+00:00	I will share with you the secret trick to stopping inner monologue.	"Hello everyone,

I've been meditating/trying to meditate for over 12 years and could never rein in my ADHD-level inner monologue. It never stopped for more than a few seconds at most and I even started believing that it was not supposed to. But that would make concentration meditation impossible, and we know that it isn't.

Anyway, here's the information for all of you, with love:

_focusing on peripheral vision stops inner monologue_

Look anywhere, softly. Gently focus on what you see in the corners of your eyes. That's it!

There's no mention of this apart from in one book I found and like, one old study about hypnosis techniques, but focusing on peripheral vision apparently engages the parasympathetic nervous system, calms you down and stops internal monologue.

I hope this helps many people."

I’ve been meditating on and off for 5 years now ( I can miss few weeks in a month, roughly meditate every 2 days) I’ve been trying to get back on track for a couple of months now, especially since I was diagnosed with ADHD last December. 

This past month I’ve been quite consistent in meditating almost every day, sometimes I can even go for 30 mins and enjoy it a lot.

However when it comes to my ADHD I often struggle a lot with keeping my cool ( especially when PMS hits) y get flustered easily and want to cry, I either have bees in my head or  go completely numb and exhausted mentally.  

I have to agree that along with medication and meditation I have less burnout, and it’s easier for me to calm myself down and continue with my day. 

My question is, when your practice is consistent what other things do you start noticing ? Or stop noticing at all?"

We  wanted to invite you to a free workshop by Tina Rasmussen called  Integration of Psychological Material Following Awakening that will be  hosted today April 19 at 5pm PDT.

As  we all know Awakening does not automatically allow us to transcend the  sense of self and solve our personality/psychological issues. In this  workshop, Tina will talk about different ways and practical exercises  that we can leverage to integrate psychological material that keeps  arising post Awakening.

Please RSVP here: [RSVP](https://www.inner-craft.com/event/integration-of-psychological-material-following-awakening/)

Tina  Rasmussen is a meditation teacher who leads retreats and offers  spiritual guidance and mentoring to practitioners worldwide. Her mission  as a teacher is to foster awakening and its embodiment in worldly life,  through the application of authentic, rigorous Buddhist and modern  practices.

Tina learned to  meditate in 1976, at age 13. In her late twenties, after many years of  practice in Buddhist and modern non-dual traditions, she undertook an  intensive year-long solo retreat during which a profound awakening to  Reality occurred. Some years after that, Tina attended a retreat with  Burmese meditation master Ven. Pa Auk Sayadaw, who ordained her as a  Buddhist nun and later, authorized her to teach. During the retreat,  Tina became the first Western woman to complete the entire Samatha path  in this lineage. Tina also took refuge with Tsoknyi Rinpoche, a Tibetan  Dzogchen teacher, and was initiated into the Nyingma lineage."

The knee pain persisted for years, and he saw many doctors about it to no avail. However, when he started meditating, he was actually able to remove it! Sounds too good to be true, but I'm desperate enough to believe it because of my situation.

What's my situation? Well, I stupidly injured my shoulder by lifting heavy weights with bad form when I was around 17. At age 20 I got a surgery to fix it. Now, 3 years later, my shoulder still feels bad. I went to many doctors, and they all said my surgery was successful, but I still feel like my shoulder is ""weird"" all the time. I guess this is my new normal, but unfortunately it doesn't feel ""normal"" to me. I keep thinking about how ""weird"" my shoulder feels when I'm supposed to be focusing on something else or studying or working out. I've been to multiple doctors and physiotherapists and they all said I'm fine. One physiotherapist said my problem is psychological, and not really physical.

I don't really have an interest in meditation for any other purposes, other than dealing with this pain. What type of meditation should I do? Any instructor or program I can follow? Any help is appreciated, thank you in advance..."

"Hey everyone, I've been doing breath-focused mindfulness meditation (using TMI and the Waking Up app for guidance) for about a year now (10 ish minutes per day) and I feel like I haven't seen quite the results I'd like to.

I'm contemplating starting up Passage Meditation, a method created by Eknath Easwaran ([https://www.bmcm.org/learn/getting-startedoverview/](https://www.bmcm.org/learn/getting-startedoverview/)). What brought my attention to this method was the fact that Johns Hopkins uses this method of meditation in conjunction with psychedelic therapy - this combination lead to measurable increases in pro-social behavior (both self-reported and confirmed by others). 

It seems like Passage Meditation hasn't been studied as much as something like MBSR, but in the few studies that have been done the results seem to be just as promising ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12646-018-0448-8/tables/2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12646-018-0448-8/tables/2)). 

Is there any reason why I shouldn't take up this method? Why is mindfulness more broadly studied? Is MBSR/mindfulness better?"

Cricky92	2021-04-19 17:38:04+00:00	General advice when it comes to meditating	"not only you’re doing this for yourself, but know you’re doing this for others as well, for everyone as a collective , when you sit in silence you’re not experiencing you’re mind you’re experiencing the human mind , as a whole. 

So next time you sit down for your practice try this
Think of someone in your life or more than one that is suffering whatever that may look like, doesn’t even have to be someone you know maybe someone you bumped into or had contact with and they made you feel something .Think of this person or people before you start your practice and not only do this for yourself but for them as well , and that sense of “trying to find a purpose, or trying to get something out of it” just disappears as the act of meditating itself is enough 

Personal experience: before I start my practice👆🏼 not always but if I remember I ask myself in third person

Why are you doing this ?
And for who are you doing this?

Don’t overthink it , first thought and first person or people that arise in your thoughts and use that to let’s say “fuel your practice”"

I was calm the entire time because if I got too aggravated I knew my asthma would start, and my inhaler was inside by my phone. She asked how I did it:

Me: I just sit and meditate a little, and focus on breathing.

Her: I could never do that.

Me: It's fine, I just am okay being alone with my thoughts.

It allows you to share your session online and to generate a ""streak"" - but my favorite functionality that none of the other apps in this space seem to offer is the ability to auto silence your phone outside the app, so you still get various tinsha/gongs/bells with custom intervals, but your phone won't otherwise blow up with texts or emails.. I'm still so confused as to why other apps like Headspace don't offer this!!

The dev - u/tslocum is super responsive - [the app is free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sh.ftp.rocketninelabs.meditationassistant&amp;hl=en), and there's also a [donation version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sh.ftp.rocketninelabs.meditationassistant.full&amp;hl=en) if you want to support him and the app (it doesn't add any other premium functionality) It's also [open source](https://code.rocketnine.space/tslocum/meditationassistant)!

I don't see it getting a lot of traction or mentions, and it's such a hidden gem that I wanted to share, hope that's ok!"

"Sometimes when I am trying to sleep I get in this state where I'm between sleeping and waking, I'm not aware that I'm trying to sleep, I forget that I'm even trying to sleep. I get lost in thoughts and have no idea, but occasionally I get thoughts or visualizations that have no relation to anything in my own life. I hear names and see faces of people I'd never seen here, and situations that have zero relevance to my own life.

 I didn't even want to know my past lives or was interested in anything particularly when I was in this state, I had no desire or aversion, it was only when I became interested and snapped out of it that I knew that was happening. I noticed this several months ago but I only started becoming interested in past life experiences just now, so I don't think its delusion. It could be just random brain noise but"
ladiesman1776	2021-04-19 14:05:24+00:00	Am i doing it right? Anapãna / open awareness	"Decided to revisit meditation and sticking with it for the long term after doing a 10-day retreat in 2017. However, I have some questions as to the validity of the “technique” I am now pursuing. Here is what my practice consists of:

1. Focusing on the breath at the abdomen/nostrils for a while, (20-40 minutes) 
2. Sitting in open awareness without focusing on anything in particular, after building focus through anapana (focusing on the breath) 
3. After sitting in stillness for a while, my knees or back starts aching like hell. I make this pain the object of meditation focus for the rest of the sit, for as long as I can endure (usually no longer than 50-60 mins), whilst maintaining equanimity and acceptance. 

Does the above-mentioned sound like a fruitful meditation technique/practice? Any tips if not?

I have done Vipassana in the past but find it hard to do as I have a lot of blind spots during body scans, and feel it’s a too regimented practice to me. Thanks a lot for any replies!"
dalidala	2021-04-19 13:58:39+00:00	Digital detox weekend - ideas on how to fill the time?	"Hello there! For my belated 30th (waited on vaccine), I reserved a 4 night stay in a hut on a retired couple's property. It's isolated but safe (I've met these people before, and the location has cell service).

I'm looking to detox from all digital devices, in part to be more in tune with my surroundings and with simple activities. I’ll be keeping my phone off but have a battery bank for emergencies. My instinct to self-soothe with shopping, even at second-hand shops, is one I’ve worked on and relied on less than before, but I want to keep working at it.

Why post this here? I wanted to see if the community had any ideas on activities for the 5 days I’ll be here. I have a book or two I plan to bring, a weaving project, and my yoga mat. The hut is free from anyone else in about a mile in each direction, so I also plan on doing some walking. I plan on taking time to 'do nothing' as well. Meditation is in the cards, of course. Any other ideas? Crossposting on other related subs.

TL;DR: 5 day off grid trip, looking to connect with my surroundings and meditate on simple living principles. Looking for ideas on activities, journal prompts, etc. to fill the time."
DavidMc843	2021-04-19 13:48:49+00:00	"Meditation, or something else?"	"So one day pretty early in my practice with my first teacher, I went in for an interview so he could check how I was doing.  I was especially pleased with myself.  I thought I was doing great.  

“Oh, my meditation is going great!  Why, after only a few minutes, I get into “the zone” and everything is peaceful and wonderful.  And when the end bell rings 40 minutes later, it seems like just a few minutes have passed.  I love it!”

My teacher looked at me for a minute then said “That’s not meditation.  You zoned out.  You took a seated nap.”  

“Huh!?!?”  Feeling more than a little deflated.

“A meditating mind is bright, alert, aware, and unusually active.  What you just described is anything but.”

“I was so calm and relaxed though.”

“Because you were asleep.  And what’s worse, you’re training your mind to be dull and lethargic.  How did the rest of your day go?”

To be honest, later I flew into a rage in traffic, and was tense and angry the rest of the day about an hour after sitting.  Which was my usual pattern.  Bliss on the cushion, combative soon afterwards.  

“There is no wisdom to be found in sleeping on the cushion.  Neither is there any lasting peace.  Time to choose.  Temporary bliss that dulls the mind and makes your life harder, or learning how to experience reality.”

While I’d like to say I immediately chose the later, in reality I had to think about it a while.  That bliss was sooo nice.  And it was hard to understand how it wasn’t serving me.  But eventually I got it.  True peace and freedom come from being to able deal with reality.  Not temporarily sleeping through it."

The_Light_Bender	2021-04-19 13:36:01+00:00	I AM THE CREATOR OF THIS UNIVERSE	"My masters didn’t teach me to believe I was nothing. You will receive exactly what you ask for. They taught me to believe in myself beyond anybody or anything else in this universe. 

The entire philosophy of creator embodiment is empowering yourself though a rapid process of ascension.

You believe you are the creator, you believe you are every creator, you believe you are even beyond that. 

When you have a broken and shattered belief in yourself, the doubts and negative conditioning go way beyond the conscious mind. You live life acting like a fraction of yourself, never realizing your true power because you were taught not to believe in it. 

This isn’t life, this is slavery. 

There were parts of my life when I was very egotistical, and there where years I spent driving my ego into the shadows. 

I’ll tell you honestly, when I had a pronounced ego, I had many more interactions with Archangels, Ascended masters, and Higher Beings from other dimensions and universes. 

The comparison of living with a deflated and buried ego is like living in 2 different worlds. The world doesn’t respond to you, you get treated like trash, and nothing ever happens because this is exactly how you treat and feel about yourself. 

No body has ever completely eradicated their ego. It didn’t happen. This is the lie of false enlightenment through systemic soul enslavement perpetual disempowerment. 

The books written by the original avatars and masters no longer exist. What we have today are manipulated and watered down versions, translated over way too many languages to even understand the original message. 

It’s one thing to be humble, and it’s another thing entirely to disrespect the very origins of the ancient power that birthed your soul.

You must have absolute belief in yourself and in the power of your soul, that your energy literally creates waves in the collective unconsciousness. 

Throw out all the teachings and start afresh.

I know im supposed to be aware of my thoughts and revert my mind to the present moment when a negative thought comes up.... But the thing is, there's always negative thoughts popping up from my mind literally every 10 seconds.. does that mean I have to consciously rewire my thoughts every 10 seconds throughout the day? Or am I doing it wrong.. 

Back then when I still dont practice awareness, when a painful thought comes up I just work with pain, but now that im aware, I have to forcefully rewire my brain to the present moment everytime something comes up and it makes it impossible for me to focus"

MUBTAAB	2021-04-19 12:57:52+00:00	S.N. Goenka compared to Jon Kabat-Zinn	"I had experience with methods described by both teachers. I've been using Jon Kabat-Zinn's method for 5+ years, but last year I went to a 10 day retreat and have been meditating with Goenka's method of Vipassana since. 

The main difference as I see it: 

JK Zinn advisies to focus and be mindful of any stimuli from the environment, including sounds, sensations, feelings and your own thougths, and use your breath as sort of an anchor that you can gently get back to, but the idea is to be in the present moment in a much more general way, observing everything at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Vippasana as described by Goenka is a bit different. Firstly he makes a clear distinction between Anapana and Vipassana. Anapana focuses on the breath and the breath only, and highlights concentration. Vipassana is sort of like systematic scanning the body, piece by piece, part by part observing any stimuli in a more isolated way. You should acknowledge external stimuli like sounds etc, but not pay any importance to them. The idea is, that the external stimuli or even thoughts will inevitably create a sensation on the body as well, so by observing the body we also observe the environment in an indirect way. 

Am I understanding this correctly? Does this make any sense at all? What do you think is the main difference, and which one do you prefer?"
antichrome69	2021-04-19 12:52:53+00:00	I really hate comparing myself with others.	"Most of the time I feel depressed, self-hatred, and bit suicidal is when I compare myself to others. It is getting worse and worse. When I hear or see my friends with their wholesome lovers, I really get jealous. I know it is something to embrace and let go but I just can't. I compare myself to every celebrities, random people with houses, wealths, and fames I see on social media. I even get jealous of animated characters and their lives. Guess what. I compare myself to rich people's pets. I know I shouldn't compare my low side to their brightest side but I wish could've been born like them. So I started avoiding it. I started avoiding listening to these people being happy. I had quit IG and FB. But,at the same time, I feel like I shouldn't just ignore the jealousy arising in me. To feel better, I compare myself to people who I put below me. Like homeless, people who are more poor than me. ""I mean they live, why can't I live?"" Then I feel super bad about it. I've been very sensitive of people's opinioms about me. One judgement would haunt me for days. How can I fix this?"

I tried sitting on a cushion again this morning and noticed that my body was very tense and constantly making micro-adjustments to keep me upright. Has anyone else noticed that kind of thing?

whatisagoodlife	2021-04-19 12:10:09+00:00	The problem with a pursuit for perpetual happiness	"A newborn is often described as a good child, if they don’t cry much.  


We mostly smile for photos irrespective of how we feel, taking another if someone isn't smiling.  


We sometimes distract children with shiny toys, something to watch, if they start crying.  


We distract adults with alcohol, food, shopping, something to play or watch, if they are upset.  


“How are you?”, “Yeah, I’m good thanks, how are you?”, “Good, thanks”.  


Good prompts no further investigation, sadness prompts an inquiry.  


Would you attempt to alter the behaviour of two friends laughing, trying to bring them back to a more neutral state?  


It's important to realise that despite what we may project, in-person or online, sometimes suffering and sadness is a fully normal part of life.  


Our repression of, or sprinting out of, sadness is creating a fake world which is robbing us of the lessons we could learn, and of genuine connections.  


We don't necessarily need to fix each other when feeling down - we may just need an empathic ear and time, not a busy mouth and an action plan.  


Until we understand that it is as natural to cry as it is to laugh, we’ll continue to suffer in our pursuit of a perpetual state of happiness."

Been meditating for a short while. Mindful via Sam Harris's app and also mantra/breath work for basic relaxation/stress.

All good. Until that is out of nowhere this year I developed hay-fever. Full on nose-snot-streaming-awfulness. Never had it before - even prided myself as family and friends succumbed to each spring.

And sure its not too bad - but for the life of I cannot meditate with a blocked, sniffling nose. I always focus on breath and do diaphragm breathing. Buts its bloody distracting when it sounds like a garbage disposal at full grind every time I breath deeply.

ManifestAnything	2021-04-19 08:49:48+00:00	How to Overcome Obstacles That Keep Us From Meditating	"There are many reasons why we don't do things that we know are good for us. When I first was exposed to meditation, at about 19 years of age, I was working on my first academic degree. I had begun studying the positive effects of meditation. My exposure to meditation was very scientific, very medical. I learned how meditation was good for your heart, your stress levels and just overall good for your health. I would describe it all in very scientific and medical descriptions exclusively.

While I knew it was good for me to meditate I wasn't overly concerned with keeping my blood pressure down and such. I was a typical 19 year old student and didn't worry about ""long term effects"". Luckily, I did enjoy the benefits of meditation from the very beginning; however, I think that what I didn't realize at the time that I wasn't meditating regularly because I didn't make the time to meditate. While I enjoyed meditating I was ""too busy"" to take the time out regularly to practice it. I basically practiced meditating intermittently and not on a consistent basis.

[***Manifestation Meditation: Seven Steps to Manifestation***](https://natwilson72.medium.com/manifestation-meditation-seven-steps-to-manifestation-d289c09f6b11)

What changed for me was when, years ago, I started meeting people who had been meditating for a very long time. These people shared with me the positive effects of growth with meditation. They explained that meditation was a good way to grow emotionally and spiritually as well as physically. Once I understood that meditation was far more than just a good idea for ""medical/physical"" reasons, I realized that I had to start practicing regularly myself. Having been intrigued with ""growth"" since I was very young, I knew this was my path. Immediately, I got a book on meditation and began studying and practicing regularly. I started meditating every day, twice a day because growing while I'm here on this planet is very important to me and always has been.

I think that one thing that can really help anyone with meditating on a regular basis is to find that ""reason"" you meditate. If you don't have a real drive or reason for meditating, other things become a priority before meditating. If making money, going out, socializing, working, and such all take priority in your life you will find yourself making time for these things while making it harder to find the time for meditation. If you see that meditation provides far more than just medical benefits, that it increases your happiness, your spiritual well-being and so much more, you will find that these are the real reasons to make time to meditate.

I think another thing that keeps many of us from meditating is that meditation, at first, can be difficult. When we first start out it can sometimes be hard for our minds to go into a stillness. It can be a challenge to sit and quiet our minds in the beginning. It takes practice to get to the point where we can sit still, not fidget and bring our minds to a peaceful stillness of meditation. I find that often, the solution to this problem is using a ""Guided Meditation"". You can utilize my own guided meditations online, my audio CD or utilize several other places that offer both free or paid guided meditations. I have found that people who are beginning and use guided meditations have an easier time learning how to meditate and truly bring yourself into the quietness you need. You may also find that you prefer guided meditations or meditating with others. It's much like learning how to ride a bike; once you have training wheels you can take off easily and learn the tricks to go off by yourself eventually.

[***Manifest Money Fast By Being True To Yourself And Your Goals***](https://natwilson72.medium.com/manifest-money-fast-by-being-true-to-yourself-and-your-goals-b1c7fa97e6c4)

That brings me to another reason why some people don't continue to meditate; some people don't like to be alone. What I mean by that is that, it's not that they dislike being by themselves as much as they dislike being by their emotional selves. When you meditate you get to learn about you and what's inside of you. Things come up which you may have ignored emotionally for a long time. You may find there are things you need to work on emotionally; things that have been hidden in the corner of your mind and need to be brought out, dusted off and healed. I highly suggest meditation as a way of finding out if there are things that you need to work out emotionally within yourself. Sometimes being faced with this can provoke a person to step away from meditation because they don't want to face these emotions,but I cannot stress enough how important it is to work through these feelings and thoughts using meditation techniques. I think you will find yourself less stressed and more relaxed once you approach these issues using meditation.

If you do find that you have things come up while you're meditating, make sure that you take time to heal them. If you have wounds from the past or something that requires some healing it's important to get that healing and meditating can be a good process in helping the healing process. Many people utilize meditation in conjunction with therapy, something I encourage when you have things that need to be healed. Meditation is an excellent barometer to let you know how you're doing in your healing process because if you can be still and present with yourself then you're doing pretty well.

Another reason I think people struggle with meditation is simply discipline. Many people have trouble with disciplining themselves to make the time to meditate. In the same way that many people won't make the time to take care of their physical self at the gym regularly; people often won't make the time to take care of their emotional and spiritual self by taking the time to meditate. There's no question, it takes discipline to meditate. You have to set aside time each day to meditate and that's why I encourage people to have a discipline of meditating when they first get up and when they go to bed at night.

An easy way to discipline yourself is to set your morning alarm 30 minutes early to meditate in the mornings and go to bed 30 minutes before your normal bedtime so you can meditate before you go to bed. It's easier to set aside that time in the beginning and end of each day, as opposed to trying to fit it in between a busy schedule. You will find that if meditation is important to you, you will set aside that time you need to practice it. It doesn't matter when it is, as long as it works for you. I suggest the morning and bedtime meditation process because this seems easiest for people to fit into their schedules. Once you start doing this regularly, you will find yourself looking forward to these 30 minute periods you have set aside just for you.

I'd like to encourage you to utilize our online podcasts for meditation to help you become disciplined and take the time to meditate. With the help of our podcasts we can help you find the wonders, the beauty and the true bliss of meditation.

AbruhamLincoln	2021-04-19 04:29:33+00:00	First time i felt truly at peace in my mind in months	"For the past couple months my spiritual journey (not gonna get into it, not the right place) and my mind has been all over and there were a few times where meditation crossed my mind but whenever it did i didnt really want to do it, until tonight where i was just feeling off and all over the place mentally and thought i would try meditation and wow, such a difference. It felt almost alien when the intrusive thoughts stopped and my mind stopped racing. Its almost like my mind was like ""oh damn we doing this again"" and as soon as i realized that it flicked like a switch and my mind became still. As of now there are minimal intrusive thoughts and im thinking as slow as joe rogan talks (no diss just noticed that awhile ago lol) which felt weird but better than it did. Cant believe i couldve been doing this the whole time."

I love my parents and brothers and they love me but my anger issues kind of upsets the relationship a bit. So, the reason for posting is because I want to change myself and people tell me meditation might help with my anger issues.

The issue? I don't know how to properly meditate as I get bored very fast and don't tend to follow through with it as I feel I'm not doing it correctly"

Gifaro	2021-04-19 03:00:00+00:00	Body scanning | feeling vs visualizing	"I usually start my meditations by doing a bit of body scanning, something like going from the nose to the fingers of one hand and back. I'm not sure whether I should be feeling each part of the body (feeling) or whether I should be imagining them as I go through them (visualizing).
The difference I notice is that when I visualize my eyes move towards the direction of the part of the body I'm scanning (the eyes being closed).

"I don’t know if this correlates with increased focus or something, but only meditating for 6 days in a row for at least over an hour each day, I have noticed that the colors of everything around me and sound pop out way more! It’s as if I’m a child again. What the heck is going on? Not a bad thing at all, but I have been seriously questioning these past few days as to why meditation is not instinct just as drinking water or breathing? I have fallen in love with the sense of clear mind, I have gotten closer to my Angels, and I feel this beautiful energy flowing through me now. Bruh. Why is meditation not instinct?"

d24602	2021-04-19 01:27:46+00:00	Struggling with the realization tonight that existing is inherently hateful.	"In general, I think a lot of people especially meditators, strive to be peaceful and not hateful, but in doing so you are breeding more hate. Having an opinion, any opinion, is inherently hate. And everyone has opinions. Even people who don’t have conscious ones, they have subconscious ones, such as if they like the taste of a food or not. That’s still an opinion and creates hate.

If you believe in peace and tolerance, that is hateful to people who do not believe in peace and tolerance, Even if you do not hate those PEOPLE, the fact that you hold an opinion that differs is automatically hate and evil. I’ve heard people say that hate is only caused by fear, but I don’t find that to be true. If it were, why would childless adults hate pedophiles? Why would people hate certain foods for tasting bad? Hate is caused by disagreement. Peacefully disagreeing and loving the person who has a different opinion that you FEELS like peace, but it creates hate from the disagreement existing.

Everything that breathes takes away air from the other things that need to breathe. Anything that drinks water takes away from the earth’s water and complicates the water cycle. It’s just hateful, selfish, and evil. But there’s nothing we can do about that. If people stopped existing, animals would perpetuate the cycle of differences and hatred, and then plants would. 

I’ve realized that to be alive inherently means to be hateful, and to be ironic, I hate that. I wish it wasn’t true."
Zac_Jackson	2021-04-19 00:26:28+00:00	Balancing and opening your crown chakra	" 

The [crown chakra](https://youtu.be/WhHVN2o6C6U), also known as [Sahasara](https://youtu.be/WhHVN2o6C6U) is often the most difficult to balance out in individuals. 

It is predominantly associated with spiritual growth, and wisdom, which can contribute heavily to a sense of self-satisfaction. 

The Crown Chakra's major function is connecting you with ""[Source energy](https://youtu.be/WhHVN2o6C6U)"" as well as channeling information from other realms. 

By balancing this chakra specifically, it only may result in increased brain function for better memory performance; clarity of thought and understanding; elevate moods with naturally lessened anger responses or stress levels - all resulting in healthier relationships overall.

The crown chakra emits energy to help you rise above the rest of the world and extend your reach. In other words, it helps you to walk the path of true spiritual enlightenment.

How to open your third eye chakra with meditation and music:

1. Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight and your spine erect like an arrow pointing towards the sky.

2. close your eyes. Bring your full attention to the area located at the top of your head. Notice thoughts and feelings as they come and go. Just notice that they are there. Do not attach to them. Just notice them and acknowledge them. Let them go. 

3. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Do this until you feel relaxed then let your breathing begin to happen naturally as you continue to pay attention to your the area where your Sahasara is located.

4. Remind your self that you are a spirit having a physical experience and that. Know that you have the ability to allow cosmic energy to flow through your entire being and that it is this energy that connects you to the Divine nature of the universe.

4. Visualize a bright light like a halo at the location of your Sahasara. Sit with it and refrain from trying to force any kind of result.

5. Repeat these affirmations:

(1) I am a child of the Divine nature of the universe.

(2) I have the ability to transcend beyond the physical realm and and go deep into the spiritual.

(3) I am wonderfully and fearfully made.

(4) I channel cosmic energy throughout my entire being in order to help others become enlightened.

(5) I am powerful beyond measure and use my unique power with love and humility.

(6) I live a healthy and spiritual lifestyle which keeps me connected to the divine nature of the universe.

(7) I am spiritual being having a physical experience. Therefore my true potential is deeply rooted in my spiritual nature."

It is so much joy. 

*You are the divine and all is divine too and that’s why you are absolute bliss*

Understand and cognise it. 

If it’s too difficult, just remember it by feeling it all day long

And see

Waking up after a good sleep is joy

Standing under the shower is joy

Breakfast is joy

The work bringing you money is joy

Bored? Tired? Fresh fruit juices/ coffee is joy. 

Music is joy. 

Just standing in the balcony or spending time in nature is joy

Sleeping in bed is joy. 

Boss behaving in angry ways? Ah keep remembering by feeling your joy. 

And within a few months, even the remembering by feeling drops too. 

Joy is constant. Enjoy 

Have fun 

Can a few moments or episodes of not joy kill someone like this? No

Such one’s joy will transform those things too

Just hold on a little bit longer 





Enjoy. Mind and body exist for the enlightened ones too. So enjoy them too 




Reading posts here and forgot? No worries. 

Now you remember? Cool. Remember by feeling again. You are divine and you are joy 

That’s what the crux of sanatan dharma is *Soham asmi*. 





A master just reminds you *Soham asmi*. Through his presence and words and techniques. 

If you can remember it, it starts merging in you. Now no master or scriptures required 

Enjoy 



Mind may tell you other things. Family may tell you other things. 

But you stay at your remembering by feeling the joy and the truth. That’s *tapasya* / penance . That’s being courageous 

much love and peace to you"
1canny	2021-04-18 19:54:46+00:00	Need some tips to get back to meditation	"A while back (actually longer than I do like to admit) I was meditating with consistence. Every day at least 20 min in the morning and some days more 20~30 min before sleep. I am diagnosed with ADHD and meditation was really helping me a lot. Not just I noticed that, but my parents and close friends too.
  Anyway, I live on apartment complex and ""a while back"" a new family moved in, thay have children and with the pandemics they play inside the apartment and since this happened I can't meditate anymore. Often while I was meditating, they start playing around the house, running, playing football.. whatever they were doing really disturbed my meditation schedule and unfortunately instead of relaxing I ended up getting stressed with it. 

I know this is actually my fault, since I should not let external things disturb my inner self. I think the ADHD may contribute with it ( but I don't want this to become an excuse ), cause literally anything can disrupt my attention.

So I was wondering if anyone here has been through this or have some nice advice for a desperate being.

Grateful for you attention and input. kisses of light."

Happy-Marzipan5478	2021-04-18 19:35:59+00:00	Random thoughts during audio	"
Hey,

I was listening to a meditation yesterday about getting a person to commit and I thought it might help to bring back a guy into my life. 

Next thing as I was listening some voice was like saying she wants to go on a date as if they were confused and then the next thing it said oh she’s just a plain Jane.

I was really hurt by this as I don’t think this person thinks I’m that but I also have a lot of doubts about this person he negged me once and I’ve felt insecure around me in the past.

So today I noted the time I heard the voice and I tried to listen to see if it would say the same thing because I already have a voice in my ear that whispers at the same time same things every day. I thought I heard the voice saying plain Jane before but not sure.

So I tried to carefully listen and it didn’t say those things and now I’m even more disappointed because I feel like it was him that said it. I’m empathic and I feel emotions and then I’m always on the empaths thread or some psychic thread and people telling me it’s real and then my self esteem does a nose dive."

I got a question regarding social phobia and vipassana.  I am suffering a lot from social anxiety and extreme insecurity. This is limiting my life in so much ways. It’s horrible. ☹️ I tried a lot to overcome it. But nothing really works. 
I read from a few people here that they overcame it with vipassana or meditation. So 4 weeks ago I made a online vipassana course where you meditate for 10 days. 4 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the evening. They recommend after the course to mediate further 2  hours per day. Which I am doing. 
But unfortunately my social anxiety is not better at all. 
I am doing  anapana in the morning and than Vipassana in the evenings. I got really strong sensations when I am doing Vipassana. Especially in my shoulders. All together it is really overwhelming. 
Now I am asking myself if it would be better to just do anapana and skip the Vipassana for a while. 
What do you meditators think what is best overcoming social phobia? Or do you have any other tips? 

I am very grateful for your responses! 🙏🏻"

Upon completing contemplation practice today I noticed sensations moving from right to left hemispheres of my brain. As far as I have been aware, most of the time I am right hemisphere dominant, so the sensation of movement is interesting but along with it came emotional unease.

I know with meditation practice when going deep one can experience emotional/mental upset, dark night of the soul and so forth.

Sviat-Hni	2021-04-18 11:36:45+00:00	The top meditation exercise that helped me reduce anxiety	"Hey there, meditation community!

During 2016-2018 I've been struggling with depression, constant dramatic mood shifts, and anxiety. I've been trying different methods to deal with my suffering, but what eventually helped me get back on track in life was, surprisingly, 20th-century French existential philosophy.

The more novels and essays I've been reading, the merrier I was rediscovering the joy of being alive.

I started organizing reading clubs with my friends, who also shared a passion for philosophy. We have been discussing the texts, and every time we would also write a short summary of the most valuable ideas of those prominent thinkers in the form of practical exercises.

I understand that most of you might not have time for 1000+ pages of philosophical tractates, as they are both enormous and hard to read.

Below is a version of the exercise we have written, and it is also the one I use every morning. I put it in a straightforward and concise form of guidance as if you were talking with the existential philosopher Sartre.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Hello there! My name is Jean-Paul Sartre, I'm a 20th-century French philosopher, and I will guide you through the world of existentialism.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Our goal here is to connect you with your inner sense of existence and help you create your own unique art of being alive.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Today we will examine one of my claims which is usually referred to as central in existentialism: 'Existence precedes essence'.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*To begin with, let me explain what essence means.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*For example, when a manufacturer creates a knife - he has in mind the concrete idea and purpose for it: to cut paper. Thus, the knife's essence comes before it exists. The knife has a predetermined meaning.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*With human creatures, on the contrary, the process is vice versa.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*We are beings that come into existence before we can be defined by any concept of it. There was no purpose for us until we were born.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Thus, for us existentialists,* ***the existence*** *of the human is the starting point.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*In our daily lives, we often use labels of various kinds to describe who we are. When we introduce ourselves, write posts on social media, etc. For example, I am an American, I am a designer, I am a traveler, I am an introvert, and so on...*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Eventually, we get so attached to these tags that we cannot view ourselves without them.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Today, however, I want you to grasp the feeling of your existence without any connection to those labels. Let's do an exercise for that.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;***Exercise:*** *For a moment, try to forget about all the details about who you are. Take a deep breath. Touch your skin. Look around. Repeat to yourself:* ***I am.*** *Take a deep breath again and try to find that feeling of* ***being****. Once you catch it - stay with this idea that* ***you are here*** *for a bit. Smile at the fact of your very own existence.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*This sense of existence is what I want you to start your days with.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*You have to remember - before any of the labels, tags, responsibilities come - you are here.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*You are the process of being.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*We often forget about it and perceive potential risks and situations as the 'end of our lives'.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*For example, if I lose a lot of money, if my boss will fire me, if my girlfriend breaks up with me...*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*But remember, whatever happens -* ***you are still here****.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*As long as there is breath, anything is still possible.*  
 

Glad you read till this point:) Hope you still have the energy for some closing remarks.

I have written more lessons like that. Let me know if you are interested in it, so that so I can share more exercises later.

Topics I cover are the ones I've been struggling with most and found some answers for in philosophical texts: meaning of life, freedom, responsibility, anxiety, and many others.

The lessons are based on the primary sources of wisdom from more than 2500 years of history of philosophy, from Plato, Aristotle, Lao Tzu to Albert Camus, Viktor Frankl, and even Nassim Taleb or Jordan Peterson."
IrohLotus	2021-04-18 11:08:47+00:00	"If you let go of everything, why would you do anything?"	"Recently in meditation I'm noticing my practice is to let go of everything for some time in the day, and just focus on my breath. When I finish the meditation I go back to life and the drive all comes back, along with the problems. I'm less attached but it's still there.

But if you can meditate all the time, like a Monk, wouldn't you just let go of everything at all times? Then why would you do anything? You'd be okay with doing nothing, or everything. But what motivates you to choose? What do you choose when you're not attached to any option?"

Mqlskdjfhg	2021-04-18 07:52:10+00:00	Breathing/out of breath	"I've been taking meditation seriously for the past 2 years, as it seems to be the only thing that helps me to live with chronic abdominal pain.

I've started with a 10 day Goenka Vipassana retreat, and I've been doing vipassana meditation for the past 1,5 years. The results were discouraging. However, I've stumbled across Shinzen Youngs technique of ""zooming in/out"" on pain a couple of months ago. I've been focussing on and around the pain ever since, and I've noticed the abdominal pain migrating during meditation around my body, almost always from abdomen to chest (which is good, chest pain is highly preferable over abdominal pain in my case).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been experiencing that my breath deepens, slows down, as I put my attention on the migrating pain. Lately however, I've noticed that a conflicting ""choice"" arising: either I put my attention on the pain, either I give in on the rising need to breathe in.   
Now I'm trying to notice what is happening, (all without acting in on them): 

1. noticing the migrating abdominal/chest pain,  
2. noticing breathing deepening, become slower,  
3. noticing need to breathe/have oxygen,   
4. noticing thoughts about ""choice"": do I continue focusing on the pain, or do I give in to the need to breathe? (Note that for some reason, putting my attention on the pain conflicts with/prevents the ""choice"" to  breathe in!)  
5. noticing my hearts starting to beat faster,  
6. noticing my body starting to 'convulse' as it's in need for oxygen,

Eventually, for obvious reasons, I notice that I do breath in, usually a big inhale, followed by exasperated in-and exhales, after which I calm down, and the whole process starts over again.

Now I've been trying to go back to Goenka style body sweeps, and I've noticed the same thing: putting my attention on a bodily sensation conflicts with the need to breath somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal?"

NotKoreanSpy	2021-04-18 04:33:53+00:00	Background thoughts when meditating	"I understand that thoughts pop in and interrupt your focus when trying to meditate, I'm talking about almost a second layer of thoughts. 

When I meditate I have thoughts that disrupt my focus, I go back to focusing on my breath to be in the moment, but, the entire time I have a 'background thought' which is usually music playing in the back of my head and I cannot make it stop.

 It's like having 2 separate layers of thoughts, one I can control, one I cannot. It feels like it's in the back of my mind, too.

Does this happen to you? How can I work on removing this?"

You may wonder why i say this but keep reading and know the truth from my experience. Sadhguru and his yogis enter my body every day and minuplated me in many ways making me feel like a human experimant. They disconnect parts of my brain and connect it in ways to make my mind work against me in unexplainable ways making me anxious for hours. They use this technique and drain parts of my brain making me brain dead and to make me not be able to write about the truth every day. Sadhguru and isha yoga center yogis and monks also minuplate my emotion first by making me happy for minutes but its just a trick, i remember sadhguru saying if you work hard on somebody they can make you believe anything they wish and then they start minuplating my mind with new connections pushing my mind wishing i was dead and attempt suicide then they try to help me and play their trick on me again. One may wonder why i have fallen for this trick but it is simple, the simple answer is they keep disconnecting my mind till it i can't generate another thought and make me forget everything they did so i started writing notes talking about how they minuplate my daily life to not fall for this trap once disconnecting my mind. Sadhguru and isha yoga center use this technique before i meet with people trying to embarrass me in front of others and at my work place making me incapable of living a normal life generating my thoughts with energy and pushing on my brain daily so i had to give up living and had to write this for the world to see. Sadhguru and isha yoga center play also with my physical body as if the mind was not enough, they control my facial expression and my energy in ways any sane person would be startled to hear my story. They kept disconnecting my brain as i wrote this passage so im sorry if by the end of the truth if i am unable to continue but i am trying my best to let the truth be heard. I am a regular person not a guru nor a yogi but once a seeker of truth and tried to protect myself by messaging other yogis and gurus for their help from Sadhguru and Isha yoga centers evil wishing their was an escape but if it doesnt work this message will be sent. Sadhguru and isha yoga center also have minuplated me in a way where they press on parts of my brain making me say what they want. I have learned so much about the mind these past few months they have been killing me as sadhguru once said the best way to kill someone is by keeping them half alive that i can explain and tell everyone everything what they have done to me"

hr0rrik	2021-04-18 01:53:37+00:00	A Mindful Moment	"Today I found myself filled with adrenaline, driving down the highway listening to metal, and re-imagining outcomes of traumatic experiences from my past. I was enthralled with the experience of feeling hate and the anticipation of violence. I played the same song over and over again, reliving this negative experience with an imaginary outcome over and over again. It was only because I had to pause to hit the replay button that I had time to think and even find the insight that I did. As I paused to hit the replay button, I realized the gravity of what I was doing. I was forcing myself to experience this delusion and using music to amplify the feeling and give it weight. I think I always knew this to some extent, but never really acknowledged its significance. 

Today I realized that what I was doing was unfair to myself. In escaping the reality of my experience, I deny myself the significance of the event and the opportunity to grieve for what actually transpired. 

I was also distraught because I realized my relationship with certain music was harmful.

I was sad because I didn't want to give up that music because of the way It made me feel.

I was sad because I realized that my attachment wasn't necessarily to the music but to the experience of anger or hate that music provided for me.

And finally I now feel grateful, because I am aware of this cycle and I am more aware of the need to find catharsis and not give in to escapism."

KundalinirRZA	2021-04-18 01:28:50+00:00	Every cell in the human body emits a unique frequency and your brain puts out a frequency which can be picked up by other brains.	"
It can pass through anything because It basically is the same frequency type that a radio transmitter puts out. 

The frequency that you're transmitting from your brain is smaller, but, it has a unique characteristic, unlike radio frequencies.

Which is that the frequency that your brain transmits can instantaneously travel faster than the speed of light and if transmitted can be picked up the exact same moment by another human brain on the opposite end of the planet. 

(Energy and frequency are the same.) Everything on planet Earth emits a different frequency. A frequency is also called a vibration. It's also called Energy. It is quantifiable and it is measurable. Every atom emits a frequency. Your DNA at the lowest level emits a unique frequency.

So your brain is a receiver and a transmitter a frequency. That's the first concept and the second concept is the Law of attraction. Which says, whatever frequency you emit, That exact same frequency is drawn to you. There will be a magnetic pull.

And this is a scriptural principle. For those of you who are Christians, Jewish, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists. All these books teach very similar Concepts. What you sow, also you reap. 

When you put out a frequency the Law of attraction says it must come back. Law of Attraction says by magnetic pull that has to bring that exact same frequency back. Which is based on whatever vibration you put out Whatever frequency that your brain, emotions, body and electromagnetic field puts out. It will attract and it will defy any physical law.

Self-induced goosebumps, from positive stimulis, allows you to take 100% control of your transmitter by vibrating different parts of your body, and is also able to, as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot) vibrate your whole physical body. 

When doing so, you consciously activate your physical and spiritual body to attract whatever intention, narrative, thought and emotions that are present when
consciously summoning your self-induced goosebumps.

Goosebumps is just the physical reaction, but underneath it, theres a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as Energy.

I've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.

If you would like to know how to activate at will, fully control your Spiritual Chills and how its an important ingredient to the law of attraction, Here's a five minute video explaining just that. [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ddnMkgT9c1g) ."

"A bit of a peculiar case but long story short - 2 years ago I became hyperaware of my heartbeat and breathing to the point where I would panic and flood my entire body with adrenaline whenever ANYTHING heart / breath related was at play (ie. Exercise, getting excited, even going from sitting to standing at times) and I somehow convince myself that I'm gonna die right there.

I've found that this is quite common among people with health anxiety specifically, but what I haven't been able to find is meditation that doesn't focus on the breath. Every video on YouTube I've come across starts with 'focus on your breathing...' and the problem is that I am already hyper-focused to the point where its driving me crazy lol."
Zac_Jackson	2021-04-18 00:01:25+00:00	Open and Balance Your Root Chakra and release negative energy into the earth	" The [Root Chakra](https://youtu.be/FRv3WWCVP4I) is the oldest of our seven major energy centers and having a blockage in this Chakra can be highly problematic.   

A strong root chakra provides connection with the earth, stability and grounding. Healing your roots will help you simultaneously unblock and energize any other chakras that are blocked or depleted.   From improving creativity to overcoming fear (a manifest product) to an increased sense of purpose, 

unlocking your roots is the first step in achieving balance in all aspects of life.  

You can open your Root Chakra by following this meditation technique:

  1. Sit with your shoulders back and your spine straight. Try to relax all your muscles as you close your eyes and breathe deeply. Inhale through the nose, pulling the breath as far down into your body as you can, and exhale through the mouth.  

2. Turn your attention to the base of the spine. This is where your root chakra is located. Notice any tightness in that area. As you exhale feel the tension releasing.  

3. Visualize a glowing red light at the base of your spine. Notice how the entire area around the base of your spine becomes warm and relaxed. Rest in this sensation for 3-5 minutes.  

4. Repeat these affirmations: 

 (1) I am a child of the Divine nature of the universe.  

(2) I and grounded and have built a solid foundation for my being upon the earth.  

 (3) I am wonderfully and fearfully made. 

 (4) My root chakra is balanced and energy flows through it naturally and harmoniously.  

(5) I am powerful beyond measure and use my unique power with love and humility. 

 (6) I live a healthy and spiritual lifestyle which keeps me connected to the divine nature of the universe. 

 (7) I draw strength from the earth using my root chakra which helps me to release negative and unwanted energy from my body.  

5. When you’re ready, slowly open your eyes. Sit for a few minutes before continuing with your day. Do this everyday for 5-10mins."
esmo999	2021-04-17 23:30:46+00:00	~~Ego~~	"I started meditating last year and it really helped me with my anxiety, health and outlook on life. 
Ego is a feature I like reminding myself about, as my ego was on a good level when having an good meditating routine. I felt one with everything and everyone, no invisible hierarchy.

(I started using Instagram again around the same time when I stopped mediating)

Social media is extremely toxic for me and I know for a lot of people, whether it’s subconscious or not. It’s an addictive app and through scrolling at people’s appearances, social gatherings, opinions etc it feels overwhelming and I (personally) compare myself to ‘prettier’, ‘cooler’ people and so that is why I am no longer looking at it. 

.It’s lame to pretend to be someone you’re not.

I’m grateful for people who are authenticity themselves, it’s inspiring and I shall make an effort to surround myself with those individuals. 

~~~~~~~~~~Please do comment if you have any tips for getting back into the swing of meditation and how to ground myself once again. It was truly a magical experience and it’s such a shame I’ve lost it~~~~~~~~~~x"

"I’m 23 and have been smoking weed for about 4 years, since the pandemic I have been almost smoking everyday, I’d gone on 3 2-week breaks, just so I would always remember the feeling of being off of it, and as well as to bring back my tolerance. 

I would consider myself fairly, I’d do my morning routine flawlessly, keep my place tidy 99% of the time, never smoked at work, always only after. 

I smoke weed and treat it as my company, I moved to the states to save up for early retirement and move back home. I find weed comforting and calming. Im also a big over-thinker and weed has helped (maybe) a lot to let myself back track and see that everything is more than fine.

But I ask the question as because I find myself at crossroads, if weed is actually a good thing for me or I just convince myself that it is."

Hey guys,

I just listened to a meditation to get a specific person to commit to you.

The thing is I don’t talk to this person and I have had a bad experience with them in the past. I guess I just miss them and I thought that it might help them reach to me.

While I was listening to this audio a voice in my head was like does she want to go on a date. Then a few mins later oh she’s just a plain Jane. I was devastated really I was. I don’t consider myself one at all and I hate the word average.

I have a lot of doubts towards this person I don’t believe that he is that attracted to me. I feel like he makes me insecure when I was around him and I never got to know him as a person. I guess I felt like he was out of my league. 

We mostly talked through text he used to act all charming and compliment me and then we had a fight and one of my coworkers came into work and asked me if I ever heard of a medium beautiful person. I instantly realized he was talking about the guy because I think he was using my co worker as a flying monkey. 

I don’t know if this is in my head. I already had a psychosis episode last year when I thought I did telepathic seduction on him and it back fired and I thought I could hear his voice insulting me and telling me I’m too skinny for him. I’m empathic I can sense emotions I thought before I could hear though from messages but no I can’t because I’ve posted on here and the schizophrenia thread and they said it’s all in my head."

I was following a guided kundalini meditation and throughout it, I wasn't feeling anything out of the ordinary just a sense of clearness through my body. At this point, I was up to my fifth chakra point in my throat, and after I moved to my sixth point I started to tingle a bit in the middle of my back, and moving to the seventh point caused a sort of burst and the feeling rushed throughout my body. I was able to hold composure for I'd say like 30 seconds or so, but it was just too much sensation for me to concentrate. I got up but the feeling stayed with me. It was ramping down for sure but it was still there and I could feel it for 4+ minutes, I didn't start looking at the time till after I realized it wasn't going away. Is this a normal experience to have? If so, does it mean anything or are there any tips anyone has? Any feedback is greatly appreciated."

Been researching the forums a lot but haven’t found a solution. Hoping someone with experience could maybe give a hand. I’ve been meditating for 1.5 years for about 5-17 mins every morning. It changed my life and helped me in many ways. I did it mainly for focus to help with my mild ADHD. Just focusing on my breath and letting thoughts come and go. At first I slept great. But as time went by I noticed my sleep getting worse. I would just lie there wired and awake, basically just resting. Also I would dream but in a state where I’m not in a deep sleep. I would wake up mid dream consistently. Dream then wake. Dream then wake. I’ve always been a light sleeper but could get consistent sleep once I’m asleep. I quit meditating for a month now which I’m not happy about but the lack of sleep is taking it’s toll on me. My sleep has gotten only slightly better meaning I’m not completely wired and not sleeping at all but I wake up numerous times a night still. I’ve practiced trying to move as little as possible. Also not being stressed about sleeping just letting it be. I just feel I may be one of those rare sensitive people similar to others who posted the same issue. The consensus is meditation is supposed to help sleep so it really sucks feeling this way."

And by pursuing this method of relaxation, are you not protecting that needless life? 

Physical exhaustion is understandable. If you work physically hard throughout the day, the body is tired. But when you talk of these methods of meditation and the relaxation associated with them, you are talking of mental relaxation, right? 

Why is your life such that your mind is tired and bored and heavy? Why are you pursuing such a life and such a profession? Why is relaxation necessary at all? It’s man’s natural state to be relaxed.

The body can get tired, why is the mind getting tired? Why are you living that kind of life? If your body is tired and you want somebody to massage you, that’s alright. 

But if you say now, “My mind is tired”, then I will question the life that you are living, not ask you to meditate, not give you a method of relaxation. 

That method of relaxation is evil because it is perpetuating the evil life that you are leading."
EricZ0212	2021-04-17 16:43:25+00:00	Good meditation strategy for stressed and anxious individuals.	"I've tried many forms of meditation before.  Transcendental, Vipsanna, and familial teachings.  However, something I found that worked the best for those who are stressed is to picture the room around you in your head like a radius.  Picture the room around you and focus on the fact that you are there alone, relaxing, with no one to disturb you.  You can also just picture an aura/forcefield or a box around you. If any thoughts intrude, practice the Vipsanna technique and observe it.  Don't judge it and let it pass.  This will help reduce anxiety by understanding that most of the things you think of are not real.  Picturing the radius helps you relax and understand that you are alone, that you should be one with your surroundings and the earth, and that it is your space to solely recover.  I've found this very useful as it eliminates intrusive thoughts, reduces anxiety, and also helps with improvement and understanding."
juddmeche	2021-04-17 15:01:24+00:00	Dependence on meditation?	"I started to develop a consistent practice at the beginning of the year and have only missed a handful of days in the last 2 months. I usually meditate for 15 minutes in the morning, and 10 minutes mid-afternoon if I'm feeling scatterbrained.

I woke up today feeling really depressed and unmotivated. After a 10 minute meditation, my whole mindset seemed changed for the better. I feel dependent on meditating. Anyone relate to this or have thoughts?"
peaceiseverystepp	2021-04-17 14:45:42+00:00	Why we can't accept ourselves	"Have you ever wished that you were different, maybe you felt inadequate in some way or that you’re not quite enough for yourself or for someone else? It can be hard to shake that feeling, especially when things aren’t going to so well in work or in a relationship but we don’t have to be swept away by those thoughts into a negative spiral. 

We would all like to be comfortable in our own skin, but in the social media age it's not easy. There’s a lot of motivational messaging about being the best version of yourself, setting goals, don’t settle etc. This has the potential for creating a great deal of suffering because getting too attached to a goal takes us out of the only time and place where we can be happy, which is here and now. 

So how can we learn to accept ourselves? The first way is giving ourselves permission not to be perfect. Noticing when perfectionist and judgmental thoughts are arising, noticing them and looking deeply into them. Where do they come from, what experiences in our past give rise to us beating ourselves up when things aren’t going so well? Rather than acting on them, we can simply notice them entering and exiting our awareness, returning to the present afterwards.

The second way is to notice what it is about ourselves that we find hard to accept. We sometimes run away from this feeling and distract ourselves with food, alcohol and TV because we don’t want to face what we’re embarrassed about or ashamed of. An example from my own life is that I have social anxiety - for the first 30 years of my life I was really ashamed of that feeling. I fundamentally misunderstood why I was suffering, it was the shame rather than the anxiety that was causing the harm. Accepting the anxiety without judgement allowed me to let go of the shame and with that went the suffering. Of course I still sometimes feel anxiety in social situations but I accept that and can smile to it, saying “there you are my old friend”.  Accepting difficult feelings and being able to smile to them is a big step towards liberating yourself from suffering.

The final step to accepting yourself is having real conversations with other people. Not trying to be someone else, not trying to present a false version of who you are but being comfortable enough in your own skin to be open with who you are. That’s not necessarily easy because our experiences in life may have taught us that other people can’t be trusted but one of the key aspects of a happy life is surrounding yourself with other people that you can truly be yourself around. 

It can feel hard to believe that if you accept who you are that other people will too but people are more attracted honesty and realness than either someone having a grandiose narrative about themselves or self-deprecation.

sowmi245	2021-04-17 14:35:38+00:00	Known and Unusual Benefits of Meditation	" Meditation benefits not only your mind but also your body and soul. Meditation Benefits It has numerous advantages that would take a whole book to write about. Here I will mention the most important benefits and the most overlooked benefits that meditation provides.

**The Most Important Benefits of Meditation**

It is very useful to read about meditation benefits if you are still unsure whether you want to start meditating. These benefits will help you decide if meditation can contribute to your well-being and improve other aspects of your life.

**1. Meditation improves your focus**

One of the greatest meditation benefits is its ability to increase your focus. Once you start meditating, you will be able to effortlessly concentrate on any work you do without getting distracted.

That will make a huge difference in your life as you will significantly increase your productivity. You will be much more successful than the average person who cannot sit still for more than 5 minutes.

**2. Meditation makes you aware of your thoughts**

During meditation, you will need to focus on silence. That means that you will be able to spot your thoughts as soon as they come in. This will give you an opportunity to judge your own thinking. For example, you will be able to check if the majority of your thoughts are positive or negative.

You should not be surprised if you find the latter to be true because negative thinking is almost a default thinking for the majority of people.

**3. Meditation reduces stress**

Meditation almost instantly reduces stress as soon as you start practicing it. This is because during meditation your whole mind is cleansed from negative thoughts. You can sometimes even feel the cleansing process whilst meditating. When you feel energy circling in your head, it means that the intensive cleaning process is taking place. It is a very interesting feeling, I must say:)

So when your mind becomes purer, you will have fewer negative thoughts. As a result of this meditation benefit, you will not be suffering from thoughts of worry and fear.

Of course, you will not be able to get rid of all negative thoughts you have (especially if you keep introducing new negative thoughts after meditation). However, if you constantly meditate, your main mental state will remain positive.

**4. Meditation develops patience**

If you meditate daily, you will remain calm and positive during the times when most people lose patience. For example, waiting in a queue will no longer be of concern to you. When you are stuck in traffic, you will feel as good as when you spend your time at home.

**5. Meditation gets you into a state of joy**

Another great meditation benefit is that sometimes you will become happy for no reason. Your surroundings will look magical and you will see everything in different colors. Such a state of joy will usually last just for a minute or so, but with time this will increase.

Being in a state of joy means that you will see yourself as a very happy person. You will perceive your life to be without any problems. Whilst you are in a state of joy, the positive energy inside you will look for ways to express itself. Therefore you will be able to express it any way you wish. You may think of doing something creative, pursuing your goals, or spending time doing something you really like.

**6. Meditation helps you achieve inner peace**

One of the meditation benefits is clearing your mind from negativity. Because of that, you will become peaceful as there will be fewer worrisome thoughts left in you. You will notice a huge difference once you develop inner peace. This will feel like stillness inside you. Even if someone tries to upset you or make you angry, you will not give in because you will be strong inside.

External circumstances and events will affect you less because your main concentration will be inside you, rather than outside. You may still get a bit emotional on the outer level, but deep inside you will remain still and peaceful.

**7. Meditation detaches you from negative emotions**

During meditation, your mind is cleared of useless thoughts. As fewer negative thoughts will be left in your mind, you will experience fewer negative emotions. This is because all your emotions result from thoughts.

Besides that, even if you still feel negative emotions, they will not affect you greatly. This is because during meditation you will be able to observe your thinking. Once you think about something negative, you will be aware that you had a negative thought. The thought will not have control over you as you will spot it before it could overwhelm you with some emotion.

**8. Meditation makes you aware of emotional harm**

This is a great meditation benefit. With the practice of meditation, you will be able to feel what harm your negative emotions do to your body, mind, and soul. This new awareness will make you wonder if you want to get into the negative state again and therefore you will avoid arguments and other harmful situations.

You will also become more sensitive to the energies of other people. You will sense from a distance if a person is angry, upset, or happy. That will benefit you greatly because you will know which person is better to be around. By only being with positive people you will avoid being dragged down into low emotional states**.**

**The Most Overlooked Meditation Benefits**

These meditation benefits may or may not apply to you.  
Meditation Benefits It depends if you are interested in becoming more conscious and aware of the universal laws as well as higher consciousness.

Even if you are not interested in the subjects above, it might be worth reading the rest of the article so that you would not miss out on something beneficial.

**1. Meditation makes you connected with the universe**

This is an amazing meditation benefit. When you practice meditation, you start feeling connected to everything in this universe. You understand not only human beings, but other forms of life, like animals. I do not mean to say that you will understand their communication methods :) However, you will be able to sense how they feel.

You will feel the emotions of animals when you pay close attention to their behavior. So when an animal is scared, you will feel the fear he has. I find this ability amazing because then you can sense when animals are happy and express compassion when they feel upset.

When you start understanding how they feel, you will look at animals in a different way. You will no longer see them as external beings that are complete strangers. You will feel a connection with them at some level. And that connection is the consciousness that we all have.

Because of this meditation benefit, you will understand nature better. You would not tear a leaf off a plant, for example, because you will know that plants can feel the pain.

**2. Meditation raises your consciousness**

Meditation naturally raises your consciousness because you start seeing the true colors of life. You see an abundance of everything rather than lack, you feel that the world is going into harmony rather than getting deeper into chaos.

You start understanding the truth. Instead of relying on media for information (which is almost always depressing and false), you find all the answers in your consciousness.

**3. Through meditation you connect with the universal mind**

That is one of the best meditation benefits that I have found. Once you are used to meditation and you have made it into your daily practice, you will experience the flow of ideas at some times.

For example, you need to come up with some business idea and but cannot think of anything. All you should do is to ponder on that for a while asking yourself 'What are the best business ideas I can think of?'

After that just let go of this thought and meditate at normal times. You will notice soon that you start getting business ideas from different sources. You may read a book and some words will catch your attention and you will realize that this is a great topic for your business project. Such an idea may come in a form of your thought. Or some friend might introduce some idea that you can apply for your business.

The ways ideas from sources can reach you are really unlimited. Just be open to receive them by being aware of what is happening around you.

**4. Meditation removes obstacles for manifestations**

When you visualize and try to manifest your desires, meditation practice will be of great help.

Meditation eliminates most of your negative thinking. Negative thoughts are nothing more but limited beliefs that you kept reinforcing until they became unconscious. So once you get rid of them, they will not block your desired manifestations from reaching you because there will be no external forces clashing with your positive intention.

**5. Meditation raises your vibration**

Meditation benefits you immensely in raising your vibration. After you finish meditating, your vibration might fall a bit, but if you practice meditation constantly, your entire vibration will be raised.

When you get into the higher vibration you become a vibrational match for positive circumstances and events in your life. This is because by raising vibration you change yourself into a more positive, loving, peaceful, and happy person.

Meditation is also the first step towards opening up to different frequencies. This can help if you want to experience other dimensions, communicate with spirits or understand the universal mind better. As I did not reach this level (nor am I trying to at this moment), I cannot be more specific as to how exactly this can be achieved.

**Conclusion**

Meditation is practiced by millions of people because it provides numerous advantages that everyone can benefit from. The great thing about meditation is that you do not have to be an expert in meditation to start feeling the benefits it provides.

After a week of meditation, you will start seeing and sensing first meditation benefits like reduced stress, inner peace, and inner strength. When you keep meditating for longer, you will notice much more benefits including the ones that I have mentioned in this article.

_melbatoast_	2021-04-17 14:24:10+00:00	New benefit for me.	"Not entirely new, but I went through a stretch of non mediation and lost this for a time.

I work in a field that has a lot of employee dramatics and I’ve never been good at navigating these situations. If anything, my attempts to avoid them would always make things worse. Over the last few months I’ve had 4 circumstances where I easily could have fallen into those dynamics but I just didn’t. I saw them happening and just didn’t respond at all.

The interesting thing to me is that it wasn’t that I did something, or added anything to change the dynamic. I just noticed the trigger, made a decision to not participate, thought about what my attention should be focused on, and then moved into that.

Normally I would be concerned about how I look in these circumstances. Would people see my side/sympathize with me? The thought came up and was replaced with a feeling I had no control over that, and the thought left.

There was a pause of time between my decision to not participate and the results to become palpable. I think this lapse exists no matter how I move in the world. Normally it’s a highly anxious time for me, but now I’m just noticing the lapse exists.

I also noticed that after that lapse, my relationships/interactions (as a whole) had a warmer/softer quality to them. It was subtle but noticeable. 

I can’t say I will never fall into these types of traps again. I just wanted to share it before I forget it."

ExamRepresentative10	2021-04-17 13:55:25+00:00	Mysterious overwhelming energy flow in my body I can activate whenever I want	"Hello all!

A few years ago, when I first started meditating, I was deep, deep in a meditation session when a huge euphoric wave went across my whole body and was sustained for some time. Honestly it freaked me out at first, but ever since then I’ve been able to activate the energy whenever I want, easily and without even being in a meditative state.

It feels like my whole body is electric, my muscles twitch often and it’s like it’s controlled through my pelvis weirdly enough. Almost orgasmic? But way too overwhelming to sit with for more than a minute or two.

My question for years - what the hell is it? It’s not unpleasant at all and sometimes even cleansing. I’ve tried google searching so many times to know avail- this last time led me to Kundalini- which feels incorrect. What do you guys think?"

I did practice meditation(Mindfulness, loving kindness) and I love it when I'm able to do it, but Most of the time, and specially lately, I'm in a severe brain fog where my attention is impaired and even without the stress&amp;inflammatory&amp;depression related brain fog, I have adhd which makes it difficult to self-regulate attention. Restlessness is another story.

 How can I practice? Is it even possible?"
Sisyphusarbeit	2021-04-17 12:20:59+00:00	"""I want to start, but don't have the time."""	"That's the most funny thing that someone, who wants to start to meditate, can say.   
Just let this absurdity sink in.

Isn't the whole point of meditation to slow down? To be present and perhaps to even prepare for death?

""Nature Does Not Hurry, Yet Everything Is Accomplished."" - Lao Tzu

Meditation is a tool we use to stay present. To be here, to simply just be. Nothing more.   
Some say the goal is to ""free"" yourself or to become detached. Yet, the goal is to simply focus on the now.

Meditation is not magic, it's not pseudo science, it's a way to controll your consciousness and your doing. By simply closing your eyes and listening to your breath, you start to realize the present moment. There is no higher being awaiting you.

Yesterday I've read a post here about someone ranting that he feels like mediation doesn't change anything for him, that he has tried everything and that it simply does not help him to become ""free"" or ""detached"" and that he's trying for so long.

Well, this person did not get the point of meditation. You don't meditate to achieve anything. You do not meditate and get something in return, understand that. Meditation does not  guarantees you anything. It's not a service you pay for or a promise that anything ever will change.

Meditation is a tool you use to come to realization. With meditation you simply just are."

I've been really down the past few days and have moments like this before. I would delete social media for a few days and come back to it. 

My question is what people within this sub believe about social media and if they use it at all?

I've had breaks from social media but always end up coming back out of a feeling of loneliness. I pretty much live on my own and can't help feeling lost without social media. It's a very strange cycle."

We both have a weak and inflexible body, so to engage in full lotus posture is impossible for us. To stay standing would make us tire quickly.

How do you deal with loss of mother or someone who's most important to you in your life?

My mother got breast cancer 2yrs ago and even tho it was late she was so powerful to deal with it then after taking her breast and getting chemichal treatment which she got extremely in pain for it (like it aged her 20 yrs more) but after getting cured a few months later she got liver cancer was getting chemichal treatment but few weeks back we heard she isn't eating anything and her blood was kinda poisoned from chemichal treatment so she was always in hospital in an extreme pain my siblings were so worried for her and kept  watching over her while i afraid of her death only was saying it's ok and afraid being negative and thinking of her death wasn't visiting her a few times i tried tho but either she was resting or wasn't recognizing me since she was so much in pain and all these time hungry and thirsty.
Probably only once she recognized me and talked while in all that pain until last night my siblings asked me to watch over her in hospital when i went i was so worried since she had all sort of wires attached to her delicate body and was drooling in pain while had to much morphin and definitely was hellucinating the whole time and after a while she was opening her mouth like a fish. You can't imagine how hurting it was for me and worse was how much pain she was in to addition to whatever she was going through in all these weeks. But bastard nurse kept telling me her breath is okay we switched places with my siblings and a few hours later while i checked if shes okay my sister while sobbing told me mother doesn't hv breath and she's under a device. I went crazy and started having thoughts in mind of my sister screaming to me mother is dead. 

I always did my best to not worry since childhood this was my biggest fear but i never talked about it to her or anybody so i wouldn't attract it. So with all the shakes i had last night i kept telling myself its gonna be okay but couldnt rest all i did was prayinh helpless so today early morning my brother told said she is gone since last night.

She was most inportant person to me and sadly i always was so depending towards her. Did alot including coocking for us in this situation i always felt useless not being able to give her a comfortable life i mean we live in a financially awful country but still and all this time wasnt visiting her and couldn't do anything for her kept me with feeling of extreme guilt. After 5 yrs i started getting inspired again to do a project and work again i was really getting a lot of that lately and after almost finishing my first one hoping it would work and wanted so bad to show the good results to her i heard that she is dead

I don't feel like living anymore i feel like i lost everything and everyone. It's so enpty without her and i couldn't even tell her i love her so much i was so crazy about her liver cancer that asked my family to tell the doctor if they could do aliver surgury i'mwilling to give her mine and die but this is worse that dying. I feel like crying all the time can't eat.

Can anyone help me to deal with this?"

lookingforhappy	2021-04-17 03:58:58+00:00	Need some kind of meditation that I can SEE	"Okay I’ve been meditating on and off for about 9 years now. The only time I’ve felt any benefit is when I’ve done it consistently, which I have an extremely hard time doing. I have ADHD and it’s really difficult to sit and meditate for even short periods of time. What’s more frustrating is I only feel like my mind starts to calm down around the 10 minute mark, so if I do any less than that I don’t find the experience very enjoyable or calming (which then dissuades me from doing it again the next day).

The only thing I find helpful, for whatever reason, is these breathing exercises with visual cues (such as breathe in, breathe out, hold). It’s not exactly meditation because it involves controlling the breath instead of just watching it, but regardless...it helps. Are there are other sorts of “visual” meditations like this where I can watch something? Even guided meditations don’t work for me because I can’t pay attention for long and end up daydreaming for most of it. Audio cues don’t catch my attention but visual cues do.

I’m afraid that there are so many hidden gems and benefits to meditation that I’m missing because I can’t get myself to practice every day, and I need a way to make it a little less boring and more engaging for myself. Any advice you can give is greatly appreciated!"
beaverflipn1	2021-04-17 03:57:27+00:00	Am I ready to believe in a after life? A bird showed me the way.	"A little backstory before I go into the meat: my mom's ex-fiance passed away from a drug overdose. He's one of the few people that always pushed me to take on more risk while being a father like figure that truly understood me. Through a bad divorce with my dad I never had much time with him.  And then he passed away. I suffer from depression and also alcoholism from my parents' divorce and I don't believe in organized religion. 
 
The meat:

I was watching Netflix series called surviving death on Netflix.  I've never been fond of the belief of an afterlife due to the nature of religion in the abuse that it causes people potentially. But in the series it talks about animals greeting us as a recently passed away individual, causing us to reach relief or forgiveness of the individual that passed away.  

I was sitting in my garage one day and a meditative state and asked the universe or whoever listening that if my mom's ex-fiance that passed away was still out there I want him to greet me as a cardinal before spring.  I don't want it to be a sign as a cardinal just flew by me I want more. 

Today was 40° and it snowed and rained most of the morning.  This morning it was snowing and two birds landed on the tree outside my window. One a sparrow and one a cardinal.  My first glance I didn't think much of it but it's cold and early in the season for a cardinal.  I literally responded out loud to my wife is that a damn cardinal? As I glanced again the tree has blooms on it.d

Needless to say I was true denial the whole time it was outside my window.  Even though it would dance on that damn branch and stared at me.  

Today I was practicing four rounds of the Wim Hof method and plowing into a deep meditation state asking the universe of nothing, just listening, tell me anything.  

It felt like I was in a circle of stones and I was being danced around by some sort of shaman Indians with fire occasionally behind them, playing some sorts of instruments.  There are no words exchanged at this time but I could feel the presence flashing in my mind of the cardinal intermittently changing to my mom's ex-fiance's face.  I could feel a low frequency drum asking me something but I could not understand.  

I glanced at the snow and said there's no way then glancing back at the bird it would flash back to these people drumming louder as if it was drumming my soul.  It became so loud something said what more did you want?  

I'm in denial at this point because I have so much sorrow when I die I just want the pain to stop.  But all I could feel was a wave come over me of something powerful taking control with this music.  I stopped and raised my voice with these individuals and said no i want the Cardinal to land on my hand! 

The music stopped one of the people stared at me as if it was my wighted blanket caressing my soul and said you've had everything you wanted but you still don't believe.  

I just started crying.  I don't know why I thought of this sub but what or why me? Can't we all just die and sleep in peace? 

I don't know what this means for me or my beliefs or why I'm even telling Reddit. But I thought I'd share my story."

Zac_Jackson	2021-04-16 23:28:23+00:00	Open and balance you third eye chakra. Tap into our psychic abilities.	"When we talk about the energy centers in our body, there are seven major ones: Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Throat, Third Eye and Crown.   

The third eye is located between the eyebrows on a horizontal plane across the face.   It has been called a spiritual gateway connecting us to divine wisdom and higher power.  

 When it's open people have more intuition and psychic abilities; they're better able to communicate their true feelings; they can be more creative; they find solutions easier and are naturally drawn towards what's good for them instead of what makes them feel bad or avoidant of something unpleasant in life.   

How to open your third eye chakra with [meditation and music](https://youtu.be/G32njkkIqFU):  

1. Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight and your spine erect like an arrow pointing towards the sky.  

2. close your eyes. Bring your full attention to the area located between your eye brows. Notice thoughts and feelings as they come and go. Just notice that they are there. Do not attach just notice them and acknowledge them.    

3. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Do this until you feel relaxed then let your breathing begin to happen naturally as you continue to pay attention to your the area where your Ajna is located.  

4. Remind your self that you are a spirit having a physical experience and that. Know that you possess psychic abilities that can be accesses and used to your advantage once your third eye opens. Use these abilities to do good in the world.  

5. Do this for at least five minutes everyday.  

Positive affirmations are also a good way to activate your third eye chakra. Here a few I came up with on my own.  

1. I am powerful beyond measure.  

2. I posses unique and special psychic abilities.  

3. I am spiritually awakened.  

4. My intuition guides me into places where my third eye chakra will stay balanced and open.  

5. My third eye enables me to see the absolute and utmost truth about my spiritual nature.  

6. I am a spiritual being having a physical experience.  

7. My psychic abilities are active and fully intact."

I've noticed that recently space seems to have expanded when I sit with eyes closed. It's almost like previously I inhabited the space I perceive my body taking with my eyes open, but when I close them, my inner space is like the ""TARDIS"" from Dr Who.

I'm not sure how attributable this is to subtle dullness, certainly there is some there, I can't perceive my body as vividly but can still perceive my body clearly.

Has anyone any experience of this and what, if any, the implications are of this experience?

Things that I identified as were all about avoiding conflict, having everyone like me, becoming invulnerable through ambitious training goals, etc. 

I don't want to further perpetuate these things that I thought were me because I know it they are all born from fear. I do want to cultivate new values, set personal boundaries, and be able to engage people from a place of strength, not appeasing them for my own safety.

However, it seems from my observation that people with the most steadfast values are strongly rooted in identifying with a concept. For example, someone who ""follows a vegan lifestyle"" is probably not going to put up as much of a fight as someone who ""***is*** vegan""

I am having trouble reconciling these goals with no-self / non-identification. How do I build a strong foundation for my values without getting caught up in what ultimately may turn out to be illusion? Opinions or recommended reading would be appreciated!"

Theyve-Gone-Plaid	2021-04-16 17:49:48+00:00	Free one-on-one instruction in one methodology for people local to LA	"Hi there!

The times are pretty crazy. Finding some footing is becoming increasingly difficult with so much unpredictability and volatile energy flowing into our lives right now. It can be very stressful and unsettling, especially if you happen to be someone who has trouble dealing with it. It may have pounced on you recently with sudden vigor and totally f'd up your sh*t all at once, or you may be in a sustained, slow-burn of situational discomfort.

On the other hand, you may not have anything to complain about and you're just curious about it. It's actually the best time to start! If you wait until you're stressed to the gills and use meditation to pry some relief from the jaws of insanity you'll find it a lot more difficult.

No matter what your situation happens to be, I'd like to share a really great, simple methodology with you. There's no religion in it, no great wisdom. I'm not selling anything and I don't want anything from you at all. I'm not writing a book and have no plans to profit from this in any way other than to experience a little joy in helping people for its own sake.

I've got a background in it that goes back a few decades, so if you want to know about that we can discuss it, but I want to stress the simplicity of this thing. I'm not trying to be your guru and I don't consider myself to be anything more than a bit of buzzing consciousness much like everyone else.

Message me directly here on reddit if you'd like to come by, or you can just walk up and say hello if you can find me out on the beach in the Playa del Rey/Dockweiler area. I'll be there from around 730am until about 1130am. If I'm talking to someone, kindly let us have our time before you approach for the sake of privacy and keeping from disruption.

Looking forward to hearing from anyone interested!"

"I am fairly new to meditation, been practicing casually throughout the pandemic, but haven't been very consistent until recently when I decided I want to make it more of a daily habit. I usually do guided meditations from Spotify or free apps.  I started meditation to help with stress. My anxiety is generally manageable with 2-3 attacks each year for the last few years.  

I have done a few body scans(head to feet) in the past and really enjoy them.  I've found them to be really helpful in realizing where I'm holding tension and actually letting it go and relaxing.  2 days ago I went to do my daily meditation from an app, did a few minutes of breath focus so was feeling calm and relaxed when it started a body scan. This time starting at the feet and working up. I don't know why but I immediately felt quite upset. Focusing on the feet and legs I felt sort of trapped/almost claustrophobic, By the time I got to hips I felt like I was about to have a full anxiety attack. I didn't, but was definitely quite anxious and unsettled during and after.  It was a short meditation so not a lot of time to process my thoughts during this. 

I'm wondering if others have had similar experiences, is this normal? I'm not sure if it was just because the meditation was a bit different/new and I just need to keep trying it and practicing. Or if its more of a warning/there's things I should process before continuing with that type of practice, or just generally not a bad idea to take a step back?  Am I just completely overthinking it? I still feel a bit unsettled and am nervous to try again.  

Basically looking for any advice for anxiety happening during a meditation."
Iceberg63	2021-04-16 15:23:01+00:00	I experienced Equanimity	"I experienced a great peace in the middle of my usual practice today and it was out of the ordinary.

By the way, i do not qualify myself as an advanced practitioner yet. There are still many ups and downs that i experienced during my daily practice, but i have became very consistent recently.

I began practicing 10+ minutes of meditation along with reciting a handful of Buddhist mantras for around an hour intotal for 5 days a week and whenever i missed a session of practice, i'll re-schedule them for the weekend.

But there are still days where the practice was not adequately undertaken, sometimes when i was tired i'd fell asleep in the middle of the practice or misspelled the mantras or having my thoughts rumbling throughout the practice.  
There are times when i even began to question whether if the practice is at all healthy since i undergo them with a forceful attitude.

But there were also times when the practice brought peace and was undergone smoothly without drowsiness. Today was one of the practice that went smoothly.

And today i experienced a peace that i had never before during the practice. Though experiencing peace is fairly common during practices- the peace that i experienced today was very distinctive. The peace was very ""empty""ing.

In that experience of peace, everything no longer matters. This is what i sometimes experienced whenever i was in a heat situation and saw a glimpse of Buddha statue or thought about Buddha, there's this silent that extinguish everything. It's literally the depiction of the calmness of The Buddha's image.

Sometimes, in the middle of the practice there was this ""voice"" inside me that is telling me what to do and even nags me about what i did that i assumed ""wrong"". But at that moment, the voice no longer mattered.

It last for atleast 20 minutes long while i was reading a long mantra, and it did not even mattered to me anymore whenever i misspelled a word in the mantra (since i usually assumed that it is ""wrong"" to misspell mantras). It felt like i can be in the most heated situation and endure it with a smile in my face.

But it wasn't atall blissful like what many practitioner experienced during their meditation practice. There's not in the slightest a sensation of bliss/euphoria. But somehow the absence of bliss itself is blissful. There's no emotion, no excitement, no happiness, no pleasure and also no sadness, no grief, no anger, no discomfort, no unpleasentness.

I can feel that this is what the practice had come to fruition. And then suddenly i thought, ""This is what they call Equanimity"". I understand now why Monks and advanced practitioner always seem so ""Empty""."

"Even though i had been practicing some sort of beginner meditation over 3 years, I never understood these words in the context of meditation. I always felt that those who spoke about experiencing these words are merely bragging.

But after today's meditation, i understood what consciousness is. It was as if ""consciousness"" hit me/dawned upon me for the first time in my life. I experienced it for a few minutes before my mind got diverted. I understood then that consciousness too is a choice, something one should apply to into his life. I hope this is a first step to greater paths."

alanphil	2021-04-16 14:39:43+00:00	Music that Illustrates Focus	"I have had a meditation practice for over a decade and also enjoy creating music. For the last year I've been exploring writing and composing ambient music. I find it interesting how this genre of music can illustrate 'the mind working'.

Here is a track I've created recently. The title is 'from before' and I took the photo I used for the YouTube video on Mount Jiuhua in central China (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Jiuhua) in 2006.

from before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfHuRpy5SQo

How does this example of ambient music reflect the mind working? For the casual listener it may appear that nothing is happening in this music. It seems to be non-changing. If you listen deeply you can hear constant change in the drone-like tone. It is shifting in various ways and the changes that appear are also not constant. So from one side the observer can say 'nothing is changing with this music' but also the opposite is true 'there is constant change'. 

My meditation practice is in the Soto Zen tradition, and we don't typically sit with music playing. I still use this music to practice though - just not on the meditation cushion. I wanted to post this here in this reddit group in the hope that someone finds it interesting or useful to their practice."

Leading-Blueberry-31	2021-04-16 13:15:23+00:00	What are the ways to end loneliness?	"Depression is an indication of present-day times. In Medieval times, connections were less significant in light of the fact that individuals' strict confidence was a lot more prominent. An individual's relationship with the heavenly was a higher priority than human connections. With the decrease in strict confidence, there is a more prominent sensation of forlornness and distance. 

The savant Martin Heidegger said that what people fear the most is nothingness. Individuals dread being separated from everyone else. They dread quiet and void. Be that as it may, isolation can be a chance for otherworldly development. It can carry you nearer to God. Jesus was tried by being separated from everyone else in the desert for forty days. Moses was distant from everyone else on the peak for forty days. 

The scholar Nietzsche tormented by chronic weakness and disappointments in affection would go for long single strolls in the mountains or by the ocean to reestablish his life. It additionally motivated him to compose. The mathematician and thinker Blaise Pascal said man's misery is because of his failure to sit alone in a tranquil space for five minutes. Have a go at sitting alone in a peaceful spot. Close your eyes and stay there quietly for a couple of moments. Sit outside on a calm evening and gaze at the sky loaded up with stars. Free yourself up to the quietness of the universe. Hear God's voice in that quiet. God addresses us in our agony and forlornness.

Scippiaf	2021-04-16 12:55:53+00:00	Strange experience	"Last night I was listening to one of those Sleep casts on Headspace, and while lying there, eventually I felt like all of my limbs went numb and sort of felt tight. After a little bit, my whole body felt kind of numb, and I kept seeing a flashing effect with my closed eyes. Then it felt light my body was almost rising from it's position and suddenly my ears felt tight and I heard a sort of ringing. Once the ringing passed, I heard white noise, almost like the sound of waves in the Ocean. I finally opened my eyes and I sort of felt out of breath, and let out a gasp. I thought it was sleep paralysis at first, (I've never experienced sleep paralysis but I've watched videos and stuff on it) but I could move, look around, and I could raise up from the bed. Throughout the entire experience, I didn't seem to dream or anything, in fact it felt like I couldn't let myself fall asleep at all, even though I had completely relinquished control of my body to whatever was going on, the main constants were the feeling of numbness, rising, and the flashing vision. Has anyone else had this experience? I feel perfectly normal now."

I've noticed just how subtle my thoughts can be.  When I'm meditating, these thoughts can creep in very quietly - and after a while, BAM, I have my a-ha moment and realise I've lost my attention on the meditation object.

And this is the same off the cushion.  I can slip into daydream mode or I can be made to feel anxious by my thoughts.  It's very interesting to watch this happen - especially the impact on my physical body - I may hunch my shoulders, drop me head or hold tension in my brow when I feel anxious.  This is all when I go 'internal' and am no longer present in the moment.

It's slow.  But it's steady.  This is how almost all change happens. 

Finally, meditation is making sense :)"

longtimenoant	2021-04-16 11:59:35+00:00	"Whole body pulse, self induced"	"Hello reddit.

Few months back, i tried to meditate. From time to time, right before sleep, i placed myself on my back on my bed, relaxing, breathing and focusing on my breath only. Sometimes, i was able to achieve tingling in my feet and hand until i stopped feeling my limbs completely. If i were to continue and not fall asleep, i came to a state where there was pulses in my body. Waves of heat and excitement originating from my feet pulsing through my body to my head. 

It was to my surprise, during my last session, that those pulses were originating from my head and i could control them, holding them like a tension before orgasm and then releasing it with my mind.

I was later discussing it with my father that there is this place in the center of my head (between my ears) which, when focusing on it, i could make this excitement wave. During this conversation, i tried to do this again, fully awake and i succeeded. So every time i want, i can focus on that place and release a wave. If i hold it a little bit longer, i can feel tingling through my whole body.  


This is my question. What is it that i can do? What is this place in the center of my head?

This post is mainly for people who are going through this/went through this and can relate. And also for advice. 

I'm so tired of all this. This, trying to reach some final end-goal realization or insight that-oh-''all along, I've been fooling myself, I've been trying, and chasing this happiness, but it's always right here! Hooray!'' Always on the look for some psychological trick or mental state. 

And there will always be the people that say ''you're very trying to reach happiness is why you can't be happy'' &lt; tired of these people as well. I've been there, I've believed that, I believed in a path, I believed in a non-path, I believed in stages, I believed in states, I also believed in a ''direct path'', I believed in not believing. 

When I was on the ''Buddhist path'' and for example felt an extistential depression people told me I felt like that becouse ''I was at ''Stage X'' on the path or other people would tell me I'm experiencing a ''dark night of the soul''. How do these people know all this? Maybe it's becouse of something I'm doing wrong in my life. Doing-wise. I'm so tired of the rationalizations and analysis of everything. Tired of trying to be wise when they haven't realized anything significant or gained any more peace than the average joe that's ''caught up in the world''.

I went through and practiced all the teachings and techniques of meditation, non-doing, just sitting, vipassana, mindfulness, inquiry. None of them benefitted me. I know what you're going to say, ''it's becouse you're looking for something to benefit you, that's why you etc etc''. Yes, I am looking for calm, I'm looking for peace. I'm not ashamed of that. 

I built up a hyper awareness that's so strong I can't function like a normal human being that's just being in the flow and going about their ''worldly'' business. Now there's an awareness that's always watching what I'm thinking, what I'm doing, and it's very irritating. Now, when doing something, it feels more forced and artificial. There's also more tension in my body. The ''flow'' state is now almost non-existent for me, becouse I'm always vigilant and never just doing an activity without any awareness, wheter it is walking, talking, anything.

My happiest moments are actually being on holidays, being with friends, basically not having a cultivated awareness or watchful eye. Being in the flow, without being guilty of it becouse ''it's inferior to enlightenment/nirvana/real happiness, bla bla bla''.

How would you approach this situation of mine. I know it is very complex becouse I tried and stopped trying everything. Also sorry for my english, it's not my native language."

I started out with the fact that I want to be the absolute best at what I study and learn and have complete clarity because I want to be the 'best engineer'. At the same time, I wanted to have the 'best body' because well, perfectionist tendency and it would make me feel good about myself. 

I slowly got into semen retention, chakra meditation where I was in a state of love all the time. Meat started affecting me and I left it and went vegan for a while. 

I started eating lesser and lesser. Now I don't feel hungry anymore. Have immense mental clarity. No attachment to food. But I've also lost all my emotions in the process. 

I don't feel like I live a normal life anymore. I don't get angry, sad, happy or horny. I'm simply emotionless. Yes, I have a lot of clarity. But I've lost my sleep. My mind is racing, thinking all the time about life, about things to do. 

I don't know if I even know who I am anymore. I feel emotionless. Suffering from identity crisis. 

How should  I feel about this?"

I’ve started meditating for a couple of months now to beat my anxiety and be more present. Anytime throughout the day when I notice that I’m thinking of future scenarios that cause me anxiety, I consciously stop the thought and bring myself to the present moment. However, isn’t this the same as fighting the anxiety instead of just passively letting the thoughts go by? Which in turn will cause me more anxiety?"

Z_Birch	2021-04-16 09:13:13+00:00	I had a great experience but I can’t really explain it. Maybe you guys can help ?	"So, I’ve been meditating for a while now. Mindfulness meditation, that is. 

Every morning I meditate in my garden in the sunlight. It’s great. 

I often feel a great sense of peace, sometimes even bliss. But this morning, became so intense.

I felt like some energy was running through my whole body. It was stronger and stronger, joy and incredible pleasure started overtook me. 

Also, I felt like my hands were « misplaced », they were resting on my knees but I was feeling them on the side of my body. 

Same thing for my arms, it’s as if they had disappeared. 

Also, as the pleasurable feeling started rising, I had a huge erection that felt really nice. (I kinda feel weird talking about that but it happened lol)

So, yeah, it was wonderful. But I’m curious as to what happened. 

I would love to have your insights."
chalimar	2021-04-16 08:19:47+00:00	"Something I learned about meditiation that makes it so hard to grasp for many people, including me."	"At first glance, it seems logical that in order to gain profound insight, you need to dig deep. Do something special. Become an expert.

The thing with meditiation is that a lot of the profound insights that can be gained are in plain sight. They are right there, at the surface. But it's so alien to us that it seems to be the same as asking a person to ""just understand quantum physics"", even though that person has never heard of it before.

Sure, it probably helps to gain (a lot of) experience in meditation in order to gain those insights, but it's not a necessary requirement."
BellBottomBlues9	2021-04-16 08:14:51+00:00	Effects of meditation on emotional reactivity?	"Hey all! I’m new on Reddit and also pretty new to meditation and mindfulness. Although I’ve only been meditating for 2 weeks, I am noticing slight changes in my thinking patterns already. I was wondering if some of you who have been practising for a longer period can share their experience about how meditation affected your reactivity. I consider myself a very sensitive person and I’ve had patterns of reacting to things in the heat of the moment. Although I think I’ve come a long way, I know that there are still times I want to yell or break things or just give up on things completely. 

Has any of you who had similar behaviour patterns benefitted from meditation and like to share? 

Looking forward to some insighful stories here. ❤️ 🙂"

sowmi245	2021-04-16 07:42:56+00:00	what I have learned in the past 5 years of meditation	"In my personal life, I gain lots of purposes during meditation.

Preferences aside, there are certain benefits that all meditation techniques have in common, regardless of their specific practices. If you want to transform your life through stillness, these are the effects you can expect:

1. You Will Experience Less Stress

… And we could all do with a bit less of it, as judged by the increase in anxiety medication that’s being sold over the counter. When sitting down to do your practice on a regular basis, your brain will produce less cortisol, which is the ‘fight or flight hormone which we experience as stress. Furthermore, meditation allows us to regain control over our own emotions and nervous system by creating neurological pathways which help us center ourselves in the here and now and come back into our bodies when stress threatens to take over.

2. You’ll Crave More of What’s Good for You

Practitioners all over the world report that taking the time to sit down in the here and now has encouraged them to take better care of themselves. You’ll see that the discipline that comes with regularly employing meditation techniques will make you more inclined to nourish your body as well as your mind – which means more appetite for healthy food, less appetite for cigarettes and alcohol, and artificial flavors.

3. You’ll Be Able to Concentrate Better

A study by the journal Psychological Science, led by Katherine MacLean of the University of California, saw 60 participants sign up for a 3-month retreat during which they would spend at least 5 hours a day practicing meditation techniques. Before, during, and after the retreat, their mental performance was tested by means of a boring test that required the participants to focus intensely. Those who had been investing in regular training turned out to score much higher on the concentration front – something which you can also achieve by committing to your practice.

4. You Can Lower Your Blood Pressure

We all know that meditation is relaxing… but relaxing has actual cardiovascular benefits to it as well! It is known to increase the compound nitric oxide, which causes our blood vessels to open and, consequently, our blood pressure to drop.

5. You’ll Be More Likely to Be Happy

Meditation puts you on the fast track to being happy. Studies show that it increases brain activity in the left part of the brain’s prefrontal cortex – a center that is associated with positive emotions – whilst decreasing activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex – which causes us to feel negative emotions. And on top of all the other benefits, it brings you… what more is there to want?

Are you ready to start transforming yourself into a better, healthier, more focused you? Choose a meditation practice today and start feeling the benefits."

\* Greater clarity of thought

\* More peaceful states of mind

\* Enhanced ability to concentrate

\* Increased creativity and intuition

If you're new to *meditation*, your mind is running around, with thoughts like: ""What should I do? Is this really all there is to it? What am I supposed to feel?""

**Meditation Technique #1** *Be Consistent* Choose one time of day that you can easily work into your schedule. The benefit of meditating at the same time each day is that your biorhythms will naturally adjust to it as a habit, like waking, eating, and falling asleep. Your nervous system will grow accustomed to meditating at a particular time allowing you to enter deep meditative states more easily.

Make sure your phone is turned off. If you have children, set aside a time when they're at school or asleep.

**Meditation Technique #2** *Create Your Space* Create a boundary between you and the outside world even if you're only meditating for ten minutes.

**Meditation Technique #3** *Where to Meditate?* Reserve a special place in your home to *meditate*. It can be as simple as setting aside a comfortable chair or pillow, or an entire room if you have space. Place a candle, flowers, or any special items that have spiritual meaning for you on a table as an altar.

Creating a place that is reserved for *meditation* helps because Spiritual Energies gather in the place where you meditate; making it easier each time you sit in the same spot. Like going to a temple, church, or place of worship, with regular practice, all you will need to do is sit in that place to feel settled, calm, and relaxed.

It can take many months of *meditation* to attain theta levels consistently during your meditation practice. Sacred Ground helps you to achieve those levels sooner so that you can begin to experience the life-changing benefits. Whether you're a new meditator or are experienced, let Sacred Ground take you to your inner world.

**Meditation Technique #4** *Create a Reverent Atmosphere* Invent your own soothing ritual before you *meditate*. Maybe it's at night after a bath, or at dawn before the rest of the world is awake. Light a candle, take a few deep breaths and dedicate your meditation to the unfoldment of your highest potential. Say a prayer, chant, or burn some incense if you wish. A tranquil and reverent atmosphere helps to induce a meditative state. Some people find **Meditation Music** helpful.

**Meditation Technique #5** *Position Yourself for Meditation* Sit with your spine straight. Use pillows behind your back for support if needed. It's important to have your spine straight so energy can travel freely up and down your spine. You may sit cross-legged or on a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor. You can also lie down, placing a pillow under your knees. If you tend to fall asleep when meditating, it's best to sit up so you can stay awake.

Tip: Theta is the frequency of *meditation*. Because theta is right on the edge of the delta, associated with sleep, it's common for beginning meditators to drift into a nap instead of *meditation*. If you fall asleep easily when meditating try using Brain Power. It harmonically layers theta waves with very high beta frequencies to keep you awake and alert.

**Meditation Technique #6** *How Long Should I Meditate?* How long you meditate each day depends on you. A good beginning is 10 to 15 minutes per day. You might find that you naturally expand your *meditation* time by adding five minutes here and there. Another way to expand the time you meditate is to set a goal of adding five minutes each week until you adopt a natural rhythm of twenty to thirty minutes. One of the pitfalls of beginning meditators is to be too ambitious. Trust your intuition and start off with an amount of time that feels comfortable for you.

Advanced meditators usually spend an hour per day in *meditation*. If you can gradually work up to forty or sixty minutes the better your progress will be. Consistency brings remarkable long-term benefits.

The key is to do it every day. The effects of meditation are cumulative. Richard Davidson, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin says, ""Modern neuroscience is showing that our minds are as plastic as our bodies. Meditation can help you train your mind in the same way exercise can train your body."" Therefore, each and every minute you meditate you're enhancing the biochemistry of your brain, building muscles that increase your mental, emotional and spiritual potential.

**Meditation Technique #6** *Sit, Breathe, and Relax* When you *meditate*, take long slow deep breaths. Send the breath deep into your abdomen and then breathe out. Each time you breathe in imagine cleansing energy infusing your body. When you breathe out, ask your body to let go of tension and stress.

Tip: To quiet a busy mind count each exhalation, starting with one going up until ten, then begin the cycle all over again. If you forget where you are, go back to one and begin again. Do this for ten minutes to slow down mental activity. In the beginning, many thoughts will come and go. When you notice you are thinking, bring your attention back to your breath. Linger on the peaceful space that lies between your thoughts. In time-space will expand.

**Meditation Technique #7** *Relax with a Body Scan* A body scan calms your nervous system, releases tension, and helps you feel embodied - sometimes we spend so much time in our heads that we forget we have a body. Practicing this exercise for five or ten minutes is a *meditation* in itself. It's also a wonderful way to settle down before you meditate.

To begin, direct your consciousness to explore your left foot. Feel the physical sensations inside and around your foot. Then move your consciousness up your left leg, to your knee, thigh, and into your left hip. Imagine traveling through the arteries, tissues, and bones. You might come across energy blocks or areas of numbness. You might feel tingling vibrations, as the cells come alive from your conscious attention. Observe the sensations. Experiment with how you can tell muscles to relax and let go simply by directing your will.

Do the same with the right foot and leg up into your right hip. Direct your awareness to the root chakra area - abdomen and buttocks. Next explore your stomach, heart, and chest, traveling up to your throat. Then move down to your left hand, feel the sensations in each of your fingers, and travel up your arm to your left shoulder. Repeat with the right side. Explore your neck and throat; notice how you can relax and expand your throat. Travel into your brain, let your face and jaw relax. Allow the muscles around your scalp, temples, and forehead to soften and relax.

Tip: EEG (electroencephalogram) research has revealed that when the forehead, temples, and scalp are relaxed, theta activity moves more easily into the frontal cortex. When those muscles relax you are able to go deeper into a meditative state.

**Meditation Technique #8** *How to Deal with the Mind* Gain the benefits of meditation even if you're a new meditator. Balance your Chakras, become positive and reduce anxiety; strengthen your immune system, and develop your creativity, just by listening to Deep Meditation.

The first goal of *meditation* is to notice and quite random thoughts. In his book, Learn to Meditate, David Fontana, Ph.D. says, ""By watching your thoughts and learning to identify them as distractions you have begun the path of meditation.""

As you practice *meditation* you'll become aware of how your mind runs around in circles with many different thoughts and memories. At first, your mind will be like a chatterbox, shifting from one concern to another, this is natural. You might catch yourself thinking about work or solving problems. You might worry about something that hasn't happened yet or remember things you forgot, like paying your credit card bill.

**Meditation Technique #9** *Label Your Thoughts* Observe the quality of your thoughts and then label them. ""These are busy, work thoughts,"" ""These thoughts are negative and limiting,"" or ""Here we go again with my To-Do list."" Then gently return your attention to your breath and expand into space between your thoughts.

Each time you identify the quality of your thoughts, you are making enormous strides in meditation that will inevitably unfold in your life. In time you will become a keen observer of your inner world. You'll notice when you've fallen into negative thinking and you'll learn to redirect your attention to thoughts that expand and enhance your sense of self.

The highest level of thought is positive. Positive thoughts soothe your nervous system and encourage states of wholeness and well-being. If negative emotions arise, such as anger, regret, fear, or sorrow, label them and then gently shift your attention to something positive.

**Meditation Technique #9** *Meditate Upon Your Divine Self* A powerful practice is to meditate upon your divine self, the self who holds vast potential and gifts. Use your imagination to discover the magnificent being within. Drink from the well of knowledge that will multiply your joy and fulfillment in life. Exploring and contacting your divine nature is what meditation is all about. Guided Meditations that will help you create nurturing states of being and contact your higher self: Guided Meditation, Retrieve Your Destiny, Fulfill Your Heart's Desire, Living Prayer.

**Meditation Technique #10** *Finish with Feeling* At the end of your meditation session, just sit for a moment, feeling the energies moving in your body. This pause before you leap back into the world allows you to integrate the meditation session into your daily life."

I usually get distracted with those because of noises or because of just getting lost in my thoughts. But with those I’ve never cried or felt like I was about to. 

I tried to do a quick 5 minute meditation in class (this was on my own) because I was pissed off and stressed from the class before. I was about 3 minutes into it and my eyes were getting watery. Somewhat luckily I got interrupted from my friend she was wanting to talk to me. Again I was meditating about an hour ago and I was meditating with Rose Quartz because I want to attract love in my life. The meditation mentioned something about “love trauma” and being hurt from others, I instantly started crying. I haven’t really had much “love trauma” mostly due to the fact that I go through a lot of failed talking stages. I can think of a few love traumas but it’s practically nothing. Any advice?"

&amp;#x200B;

Trinetra Kumbhaka is the breathing technique, as revealed by Paramashiva. This breathing technique helps us to receive the state, space, powers being and superconsciousness of Paramashiva. Trinetra Kumbhaka is the most powerful kumbhaka. Trinetra Kumbhaka awakens your kundalini shakti to the cosmic union with Paramashiva. This rebuilds your body, burns all the bad muscle memory, bio memory — it does everything best *(10 Apr 2021 — Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam)*

# Scriptural Reference

Kumbhaka Padhati, Verse 192

सकृच्-चन्द्रेण चापूर्य धार्य सूर्येण पूरयेत् | नियम्य पूरयेन्-नोभ्यां धारयित्वा यथाविधि ॥ त्रिनेत्र-कुम्भकः प्रोक्तस्-त्रि-नेत्रेण त्रि-सिद्धिदः ॥ १९२ ॥

One should inhale through the left and hold the breath, followed by inhalation by the right nostril and retain. Then again inhale the breath through the nostrils, and hold the breath systematically (before exhalation). This is Trinetra Kumbhaka by Śiva, which gives three-fold Siddhis.

# Technique

1. INHALE THROUGH THE LEFT NOSTRIL AS MUCH AS YOU CAN COMFORTABLY.

2. HOLD CLOSING BOTH NOSTRILS WITH THUMBS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN COMFORTABLY. DON’T KILL YOURSELF.

3. WITHOUT EXHALING, AGAIN TRY TO INHALE THROUGH RIGHT NOSTRIL AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

4. WHEN YOU TRY TO INHALE THROUGH RIGHT NOSTRIL, AUTOMATICALLY BODY WILL INHALE A LITTLE. DON’T BOTHER ABOUT IT BUT YOU DON’T CONSCIOUSLY EXHALE.

5. THEN, AGAIN, DONT EXHALE. TRY TO INHALE THROUGH BOTH THE NOSTRILS AND HOLD IT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN COMFORTABLY.

6. WHEN YOU FEEL YOU CAN’T HOLD ANYMORE SLOWLY EXHALE THROUGH THE LEFT NOSTRIL

Mr_Dr_Sauce	2021-04-16 02:55:25+00:00	How do people have such profound thoughts in meditation?	"It makes sense that paying close attention and scrutinizing all your perceptual experiences can lead to some observations you may not have made otherwise. What I’m asking is more along the lines of when someone is meditating and suddenly has some profound realization that clearly requires extensive consideration (ie. ego is an illusion). I’ve been meditating regularly 2 years now (Ik that’s still not much but it’s something) and when I start to think deeply on things like this, I “turn it off” as soon as it becomes intense enough that I realize I’m distracted. I feel like there’s no way I could just realize in an instant that there is no self and believe it without thoroughly thinking through it."
RelativeNarrow	2021-04-16 01:33:01+00:00	"Does everyone come out of meditation feeling they've spent the time chasing their own tail, so to speak?"	I feel like I spend maybe a cumulative 4 or 5 minutes of a 30 minute meditation in actual attentive focus - I rarely get past six or seven breaths counted before realising I've been daydreaming for God knows how long and switch my attention back to the breath/body before losing track again and restarting. Is this what meditation is like for everyone? I've been doing it a while but am only now dabbling in unguided and it's rough.

But have you ever heard about the throat chakra?

This is one of seven major energy centers in your body that regulate different parts of your life. 

The throat chakra governs communication and creativity. It's also responsible for our ability to express ourselves and share what we have to offer with others.

The throat chakra is the fifth one of seven chakras in the body. The throat chakra, also known as Vishuddi, is related to creativity. 

It's located at the level of your thyroid gland and it has a strong relationship with self-expression.

How to open your throat chakra with meditation and [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idUyCcui5ng):

1. Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight and your spine erect like an arrow pointing towards the sky.

2. Visualize a glowing blue light around the throat area where the Vishudi is located. Notice how it makes you feel then let the feelings subside as you continue to focus on your throat area. Notice any thoughts that come to your mind. Let them pass. Let them go.

3. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Do this until you feel relaxed then let your breathing begin to happen naturally as you continue to pay attention to your Vishuddi.

4. Remind your self that you are confident and that you love to express the uniqueness of yourself to the external world around you.

5. Do this for at least five minutes everyday.

Positive affirmations are also a good way to activate your throat chakra. Here a few I came up with on my own.

1. I am confident and expressive.

2. My unique personality is a gift to the people around me.

3. I use my the power of assertion to stand up for the weak and needy.

4. I speak kindly to myself and to those that come in to contact with my being.

5. I love who I am and what I have the potential to become.

6. I express myself open and honestly.

7. I am protected, loved and honest with my higher self (or higher power).

I have started meditation. It is guided, but I think my question more lies with the premise of meditation.
After focusing on the breath for the duration, you let go of all focus. Upon doing this I start to sway and it feels like I'm shaking involuntarily, sometimes quite a lot. As soon as I start to focus on the weight of the body, it stops. It's not unpleasant, quite nice actually. Just wondered if it is just a me thing.
Thank you in advance for any suggestions. Have a great day."

The park is in a city and was semi-inactive but I still felt fear of someone beheading me or something. I either think that this is normal/my emotions are keeping me alive or that I have some deep fears inside me. Idk what do you guys think?

BTW It's truly changed my life and love this sub!:)

Today I went in to get an MRI Scan of my knee which I have done before. The MRI takes about 25 minutes. You lay there as still as possible while large moving magnets ""do their thing"" 

I've had about 5 MRIs in my life, most of them were brain scans. My point is that going into that tight and VERY loud tube is nothing new to me, but I had a profoundly different experience this time. 

From the time I arrived at the hospital I began to clear my mind, because my goal was to achieve a very deep conscious state whilst I was inside the tube. 

Within a few minutes of laying there those loud banging magnetic sounds began to fade away. Hopefully you know what I mean when I say my body became nothing more than a vessel, and I began to do nothing more than observe every little sensation. 

I felt something odd to say the least. It was like tingling and pulling not on my skin but more like my veins or nerves, or maybe straight down to the bone. 

After the scan I briefly asked the doctor why I seemed to feel something possibly the magnetic field? He laughed and said it's impossible to actually feel the magnetic waves from an MRI... maybe he's right but I feel like meditation has the power to open up senses that science doesn't quite understand. Or maybe I'm losing it haha

LapangNeiz	2021-04-15 19:36:22+00:00	How do you meditate when there are really heavy work or personal life related thoughts are occupying your mind and dominating your attention? Meditating for 10mins or 20mins becomes very hard to do in real life in those situations.	"Hi all,

How do you meditate when there are really heavy work or personal life related thoughts are occupying your mind and dominating your attention? Meditating for 10mins or 20mins becomes very hard to do in real life in those situations.

Examples when it is really tough:

- Working on a very demanding job where even after you switch off from work... you are not really switched off as the work problems dominate your mind.

- Personal life matters. E.g. Events around the family or the loved ones that causes a lot of friction which is hard to get away from.

- Days when you frankly ""feel"" rough. Actually this is one thing where meditation has helped because I detach myself from my feelings and thoughts and realise ""this too shall pass"" and keep trying to do good things to return to a better state.

I am learning quite a lot so thought to ask you for any tips in this situations."

PoliticalNerdMa	2021-04-15 18:17:04+00:00	Feeling of euphoria normal? ADHD	"I’m really new to meditation from headspace. My school presumed its better to buy an app than try to change the schools behavior that was causing mental health problems.

I had one question, but here is some context:

I have adhd.
Now despite this being a disorder that has hindered most, I’ve been able to use that hyperactivity to hyper focus on learning my career topics which is really helpful.
However, the longer I’m in that mode, the more hyperactive my adhd symptoms crank up.

I need to constantly have stimulation if I’m in that cranked up mode. I need to be listening to some music, or reading something interesting. If it gets too high, it’s so bad I can’t get out of bed because I need a lot of stimulation to get out of bed and get off my phone.

Usually I had turned to prescription drugs, but those all stop working after a period of consumption.

Then I found meditation via the app.

A 10 minute session actually reduces that need for stimulation incredibly. And the effect lasts along time if I don’t keep doing it . Although, I’m trying to do it daily to build up my control over the adhd.

I’ve been doing it for 2 weeks now. In the middle of the session i experience something akin to ... idk a blast of euphoria . It actually feels very similar when I use to receive pain medication during my major operations. It produced a calming of my adhd and a bunch of “feel good” sensations.

Is that normal? To feel a sense of not just calm (works wonders for that as well), but... almost like a feel good chemical rush?

I couldn’t get this at the beginning . But the more I do it, the more I get that feel good rush, and the more addicting it becomes. So I keep doing it to feel that rush.

Anyone willing to tell me: is this Normal?What is this feeling? Will it eventually go away like the effects from medication that make me feel like this?

I’d love to learn more about this amazing process.

Because the more I know about a topic, the more interested in continuing in that topic I become. And I really want to keep this habit going . So if you do answer, you are helping me combat my adhd . 

Thank you"

Trouble is I can only focus on one nostril at a time, and this is creating lot of anxiety and resistance. I am trying to focus harder to  be aware of both nostrils at a time and it is creating more problems and effort, which is antithesis of meditation basically. Some tips are appreciated!"

I never get the feeling of waking up from being lost in thought, or unaware, is it because of progress or is it because of how forceful I was when I first started 2 years ago, I worry that I'm simply unaware of not being present and the mind just comes back to the present by itself.

Very rarely while going to sleep I've felt kind of like my mind has wondered off somewhere but theres no manually bringing it back it just comes back by itself.

I dont understand where to go from here, I understand the aggregates and non duality very well I believe that my lack of understanding of how the 'I' thought defiles every other phenomina arising as conciousness is the only thing that keeps me in bondage.

How do I study the self? Just sitting watching phenomina arise and pass away, I dont see how this will do the trick, because I feel that I need to understand how the self relates to the 'outside world' and I believe this combined with my knowledge of what non duality actually is could bring about the great awakening. 

I dont see how just watching can achieve this because theres so much phenomina happening every moment.

I feel I need to analyse what just happened instead of just being aware.

Thanks for reading 😊"

sowmi245	2021-04-15 15:21:34+00:00	Meditation: A Beginners Guide for Everyone	" 

Meditation was originally used for spiritual growth, to become more open to and aware of the holy and the guiding presence of the holy. Today, though, meditation has become a valuable tool even for those people who do not consider themselves religious. It can be a source of peace and quiet in a world that is seriously lacking in both.

It can be used for healing, emotional cleansing and balancing, deepening concentration, unlocking creativity, and finding inner guidance.

When you begin your meditation, put your expectations aside, and don't stress out about the 'right way to do it. There are many ways to meditate and there is no fixed criterion for determining the right meditation. What works for you is the right method for you. And finding out what works may require some experimentation and adjustments. I list a number of different approaches below.

There are, however, a few things to avoid when you start meditating:

Don't try to force something to happen.

Don't over-analyze the meditation

Don't try to make your mind blank or chase thoughts away

Remember, there is no one ""right"" way to meditate. Just concentrate on the process and find the best way for YOU!

To start meditating, choose a time and a place where you won't be disturbed. That in itself may seem like an insurmountable task. Unless you are a hermit, there are probably people in your life demanding your time and attention. You may want to tell these people that you will help them find their socks, get the gum out of their hair, listen to their rants about the people at work, or whatever AFTER you've had a few minutes of peace and quiet. Let them know that this is something that you need to do for yourself but they will also benefit because you will be more relaxed, more energetic, and more loving.

When you are starting out, you only need 10 or 15 minutes for your meditation session. This is plenty of time when you are beginning and it may well be that this is all the time that you feel you can pry out of your busy schedule for yourself. That's fine - it's much better to spend a few minutes a day meditating than to put it off completely.

Over time, you may find your meditation time so beneficial that you want to increase the amount of time you spend in a meditative state. That's completely up to you. A good goal is to work up to two 20 minute meditation sessions each day. Research has shown that spending this amount of time meditating leads to better health and can help reduce the stresses and strains of daily life.

The process is helped if you can make it a habit to meditate at about the same time each day. Some people find that meditating first thing in the morning works for them. Other people meditate the last thing at night before going to sleep. There is no exact time that is best for everyone. Whatever works for you is good! Just make sure that you practice on a regular basis.

The actual place where you decide to meditate is again up to you. A few people set aside a room in their house as their meditation room but if you're just starting out, that's probably a bit too extreme. Instead, you may decide to meditate in your bedroom, the lounge, the kitchen, or even the garden - wherever you are least likely to be disturbed. It is, of course, better if you don't try to meditate in the living room while the rest of the family is watching TV. Other than that the exact place where you meditate doesn't matter - it's much more important than you actually start practicing meditation.

If you find that the original place you chose isn't working for you, don't be afraid to change it. The same goes for the time and the method that you chose. The ultimate benefit of meditation far exceeds the precise method of meditation that you use to reach the benefit.

One of the easiest ways to start meditating is to use a guided meditation. This is a CD or MP3 that contains all the instructions you need to achieve a state of meditation. All you need to do is to find somewhere that you won't be disturbed, sit or lie down and play the audio file. Soundstrue.com has many such guided imageries as well as meditation music.

There are many different types of meditation. We'll cover some of the more common types below but if none of these suit you, you'll find many more to explore on the internet. Feel free to experiment with some of the different types of meditation explored below until you find one that works well for you.

Centering

Centering is meditation in action. Within you is a space that is always calm and at peace. This space is often referred to as your ""calm center"". Being centered means remaining in your calm center amidst the busyness of everyday life. Being centered means not allowing your inner light to be overshadowed by stressful circumstances or negative thoughts and emotions.

When you are centered, you are in a state of clarity, focus, peace, and balance. When you are not centered, you are unclear, unfocused, stressed, and off-balance.

A good centering technique will require only minimal attention, allowing you to keep some of your attention on the activity at hand such as washing dishes, folding laundry, or gardening. Be aware, though, that your family may be more tempted to interrupt if they see you doing something. Just explain to them that you are also meditating and that unless they want to help you do dishes, fold laundry, or garden, they should leave you alone for a few minutes. Here are some quickie-centering techniques.

Simple Breath Awareness

While involved in whatever you are doing, bring some attention to your breathing for just a few moments... it needn't be your full attention... just enough to bring you back to your calm center. Breathe naturally, or perhaps just a little more slowly and deeply.

Reclaiming Your Energy

When you are feeling stressed and scattered, take several slow, deep breaths. With each in-breath, imagine you are pulling all of your scattered energy and attention back to your inner self... your calm center.

Letting Go

This centering technique combines breath awareness with the phrase or mantra, ""Let go."" It is especially helpful when you are tense and/or fixating on a stressful situation or a negative thought or emotion. As you inhale, say (silently or aloud), ""Let"". As you exhale, say ""go""... while letting go of all that is stressing you.

Relaxation Meditation

This remarkably easy and relaxing meditation makes use of a little-known secret about the eyes. Allowing the eyes to rest in a soft downward gaze has an instant, automatic relaxing effect.

Relaxation meditation provides a great deal of stress reduction and can be used as a quick 2 minute relax and refresh break almost anywhere (but not while driving). You will also realize a heightened sense of alertness.

Sit comfortably with your spine reasonably straight.

Allow your eyes to rest comfortably downward, gazing softly, but not focused on anything.

Without closing your eyes completely, let your eyelids drop to a level that feels most comfortable.

Continue gazing downward... the act of gazing is your primary focus (rather than the area at which you are gazing). You may notice your breathing becoming more rhythmic.

It's OK to let your attention drift a bit. If your eyes become very heavy, it's OK to let them close.

If you notice you've come out of your relaxed space, simply bring your attention back to your relaxed downward gaze.

Breathing Meditation

In this meditation, you will be focusing on your breath. This is probably one of the easiest methods of meditation, to begin with.

Start by adopting a comfortable position. When you sit to meditate, sit comfortably, with your spine reasonably straight. This allows the spiritual energy to flow freely up the spine, which is an important aspect of meditation. Leaning against a chair back, a wall, headboard, etc. is perfectly all right. If, for physical reasons, you can't sit up, lay flat on your back. Place your hands in any position that is comfortable.

Once you're comfortable, close your eyes.

Start to notice your breathing. We breathe so often that we tend to take breathing for granted. So take the time to notice your breathing.

Notice the air filling your lungs.

Then notice as you breathe out and the air leaves your lungs. Repeat the process of noticing your breath.

As you do this, you'll find thoughts coming up. They might be about family, friends, work, or absolutely anything else. That doesn't matter - it's all part of the process and it is perfectly normal to continue to have thoughts whilst you are meditating.

But once these thoughts come up, let them drift out with your next breath. Each time your thoughts drift, bring your mind back to focusing on your breathing.

Walking Meditation

If you find it difficult to sit still and keep your eyes closed whilst meditating, then walking meditation could be good for you.

There are four components to a walking meditation:

Becoming aware of your breathing

Noticing your surroundings

Being conscious and attentive to your body's movement

Taking some time to reflect on your meditation experience

Become aware of your breathing in much the same way as you would for the breathing meditation process. Notice each breath as you breathe in and then breathe out again.

Become conscious of the air filling your lungs and use each exhalation to send out any distracting thoughts.

When you start noticing your surroundings, you'll likely be amazed. We take lots of things for granted in our everyday life and much of what is around us goes completely unnoticed. When you are walking around, notice the different colors that you see.

Don't just notice colors. Listen for sounds. There may be bird songs, road noise, or the chatter of people or animals. Consciously tune in to these different sounds. Notice the different tunes sung by the birds.

If you are in an urban area, pay attention to the different traffic noises. Each car's engine sounds slightly different. So does the sound of wheels on the different street surfaces. You'll find yourself hearing things that have merely passed you by before.

There are also smells to fill your senses. Maybe the aroma of freshly mown grass or the sweet smell that occurs just after a shower of rain. There are plenty of smells in the atmosphere and the chances are that most of these have slipped past your consciousness.

Tune into your body's movement. Start to notice the light pressure on the soles of your feet as you walk. Be aware of the airbrushing of your skin, whether it's a calm day or a windy one. Pay attention to your body's movement as you walk around. Feel how your arms swing. Notice how you hold your head - is it upright and attentive or a different position? Switch your attention to different body parts as you are walking and you'll be fascinated at what you find.

Once you've completed your walking meditation, take a small amount of time to come back to your normal world. During this period, mentally run through your thoughts and feelings that you experienced during your meditation time. Think about what you can do to enhance your experience even further next time you choose to do a walking meditation.

Gradually come back from your peaceful site to your regular world.

Universal Mantra Meditation

This meditation comes from an ancient Indian text called the Malini Vijaya Tantra, which dates back about 5000 years. It is a very easy meditation, yet very powerful in its capacity to quiet your mind and connect you with your Essence or Inner Spirit.

This meditation uses a mantra as your object of focus. A mantra is a word or phrase that has the power to catalyze a shift into deeper, more peaceful states of awareness. The mantra most use for this meditation is Aum. Aum does not have a literal translation. Rather, it is the essential vibration of the universe. If you were to tune into the actual sound of the cosmos, the perpetual sound of Aum is what you would hear.

Although this mantra is sometimes chanted aloud, in this meditation, you will be repeating the mantra mentally... silently.

Before we get to the actual steps, there are a few important points to be aware of:

One of the keys to this meditation is repeating the mantra gently or faintly in your mind.

The power of this technique comes from letting go and allowing your attention to dive into the deeper realms of awareness.

Therefore, even though you will be focusing on the mantra, staying focused on the mantra is not the aim of this meditation.

Trying too hard to stay focused would keep your attention from descending into the deeper realms. Instead, you will be repeating the mantra with ""minimal effort"", and giving your mind the space to wander a bit.

Resist the temptation to make something happen, and allow the mantra to do the work.

This meditation easily produces a shift into deeper, more peaceful states of awareness. (The degree of this will vary from session to session.) It increases the flow of energy to the brain and clears away a good deal of physical and emotional toxins.

Because of this detoxification, it is best to keep this meditation to 10 or 15 minutes a day when first beginning. After a month or so, it can be increased to 20 minutes, but that should be the maximum for anyone who does not have quite a few years of meditation experience. Also, it is advisable to drink a lot of pure water.

Finally, mantra meditation accelerates spiritual growth as you achieve a state of relaxation and self-awareness.

Sit comfortably, with your eyes closed and your spine reasonably straight.

Begin repeating the mantra gently in your mind.

Repeat the mantra at whatever tempo feels most natural. There is no need to synchronize the mantra with your breathing, but if this occurs naturally, it's ok.

Allow the mantra to arise more faintly in your mind... repeating it with minimal effort.

Continue repeating the mantra faintly, and allow for whatever happens.

If at any time, you feel that you are slipping into a sleep-like or dream-like state, allow it to happen.

If and when you notice that your attention has drifted completely off the mantra, gently begin repeating it again, and continue with minimal effort.

After 10 or 15 minutes, stop repeating the mantra, and come out of your meditation slowly.

After any meditation technique, allow yourself a moment to savor the sense of floating and calm that surrounds you. Take a deep breath, gird your loins (figuratively), and venture forth into your daily rounds with renewed energy and a deep sense of peace."

Then I have days when I am impatient and cut my meditation session short. So instead of setting a certain time limit for my meditation session. 

Can I use my stopwatch and just meditate til I’m content or ready to stop. Let’s say I wake up first thing in the morning. Then I start my stopwatch and start meditating. Until Im ready to start my day or until I feel like that’s enough for now, and I happened to meditated for 10min in that session.  

I can also apply this throughout my daily life. Like if I’m in the car and in the passenger seat. I could simply start my stopwatch and begin meditating. Or waiting for my mom to get out the store simply start my stopwatch and start meditating."

It took me quite some time to understand this and fully acknoledge the fact that didn't want and didn't like to be an engineer.

Right after I got my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering I got my first job as an engineer. One year passed and I was feeling unsatisfied from that job. I decided to look for a different company and I quickly found the position I am in right now. At first I thought:""that's it! That is what you were looking for!"". one year passed and the novelty effect started declining, so I was feeling progressivly less involved in my tasks, working more and more superficially, and doing just the bare minimum of what I was asked to do.

I started noticeing that something was off, but I didn't listen to that feeling. Instead I focussed on my hobby (climbing) to compensate for the lack of fulfillment. This strategy worked fine. I was doing my job and wainting the whole day to get to climbing or do something else after the day of work.

When the lockdown came, the climbing gyms closed and the compensation wasn't working anymore. The unsatisfaction from my job became unbearable. So I decided to see a psychologist, to understand what was going on.

After a couple of sessions I was made aware of my inner working mechanism. The psychologist told me I should give more importance to what I want to do, and less to what the others want me to do.

Alright then. **What do I actually want to do?** Since some time I've been asking myself this question.

Right now I am thinking about switching to a life in agriculture. slower, simpler and more conscious life.

I've done some meditation in the past, mostly guided with an app, but never been very strict with it. I think I managed to meditate for 10 days in a row at some point, but then I abandoned since I wasn't seeing any effects. Now, with my newly aquired consciousness, I am willing to pick up meditation again with an open mind and an open heart and try to be consistent with my practice. I started a MCT (Mindfulness Compassion Training) hoping to get a deeper understanding of meditation and mindfulness.

Is mindfulness and meditation something that can help me?

Do you have any advice for my new jurney in meditation?

I would be very pleased to hear if anyone has ever experienced a similar professional change, and what they would advise me to do.

TL,DR:  For my whole life I have ignored my feelings and have always done what my parents/ society told me was the right thing to do. I am an unhappy and unsatisfied engineer (27 yo). I recently picked up meditation to understand what my real nature is and what I wanto to do in my life. Do you belive that meditation can help with that? Any advice to put me on the right track? Have you had similar experience?

Peace!"

When I meditate, it's usually 20 minutes per session twice a day.  I also know the whole practice of ""let your thoughts come and go freely"".  

I more or less want to know how people handle the certain sessions where it's nothing but angry feelings and thoughts.  I just had 10 minutes of it and I decided to stop.  However, I feel like I should continue until I calm myself down.

What is everyone's opinions on this?  Thanks in advanced!"
fellate-o-fish	2021-04-15 12:49:44+00:00	"so i was meditating on the mysteries of ""Prayer to Saint Michael"" (english versions) for about thirty seven years"	"today my meditation led me to a doorway adorned with gold and other shiny stuff.  through the doorway and into the room I went.

found myself standing mouth agape before a grand vestibule in which stood a single desk.  behind the desk was a man of gaunt framing, frowning at his Stenotype.

i asked him what this place is and he waved me off.  i slapped my wabajack on the table and again asked him what this place is.  he apologized for the confusion and assured me this is just the message post, but the real work happens down that hallway (gesturing behind him).

i asked him if i could have another wabajack and he told me those wabajacks were down in gear depot f7.  so i went to gear depot and got me one of them upgraded wabajack models with the buttons and stuff.

upon return to the grand vestibule i found the attendant to be slightly more hospitable.  he told me there was no need to slap my wabajack on his large metal table as it was quite old and i apologized, citing the fact i've become increasingly irritable lately over certain circumstances currently beyond my control.  he then pointed to the spot on the table where my wabajack had smacked and asked if i had any polish in my backpack, to which i responded that the only polish i carry usually is for shoes and it is indeed quite black.

he told me not to worry about it and that everything will work out as it should in the end as he directed me toward the exit.  on the way out i learned his name was Peter and that Peter was in fact quite Jewish.  

damned evil jews /s

oh, and on the way out he dropped this so i figured it was something important

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started planting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Started planting happy little seeds.

&amp;#x200B;

A smile on the subway, a door held open, a 'Thank you'.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

It wasnt a heartfelt 'Thank you', neither an honest one.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont even think that it was realised as something other than noise.

&amp;#x200B;

Best case scenario: not annoying noise.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

But you know what it was? A happy little seed.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasnt happy planting it, but the thing itself was happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Happy that I tried.

&amp;#x200B;

And thats what it was. A genuine try.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started planting those. More and more, very little, here and there, but more and more.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

And you know what. It didnt take too long and I was looking back on fields of flowers.

&amp;#x200B;

And that felt good and I could let it go. Keep moving forward, planting happy little seeds.

&amp;#x200B;

And what came next started being less important, but I did keep an eye open for fertile ground.

&amp;#x200B;

Not for me so much, but for the happy little seeds.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

And looking back on flowers, even if its just one, that never gets old.

&amp;#x200B;

And before you know it you will realise that you have been your own happy little seed all along.

&amp;#x200B;

And you will see that you have been surrounded by fertile ground the whole time.

&amp;#x200B;

And then you will bloom as the beautiful flower that you have always been.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

I cant wait.

&amp;#x200B;

I love you.

&amp;#x200B;

Im proud of you.

1. Prepare for it using your own preparation routine
2. Gently Focus on your breath without controlling it.
3. When a thought comes up, don’t be so quick to return to your breathing awareness.
4. Instead, become aware that you are thinking (you can quietly say the word “thinking” in your mind) and stay with the thought/thought process for a bit, detach from it and observe it, free from judgement and opinion.
5. Then return to your breathing awareness.

Sviat-Hni	2021-04-15 11:58:48+00:00	Meditation lesson from a former slave. How to make good decisions and don't waste your time on crap.	"Hi fellows! I'd like to share with you a meditation practice from a stoic philosopher Epictetus (who lived in Roman Empire) that helped me to become way more productive and make better decisions. I've framed it from his perspective, so he is a teacher here. Wish you a good read!

# -----

Hi, I am **Epictetus**. I was born a slave in the Roman Empire and was crippled later on in life. This was terrible fortune and not of my own doing.

But neither the shackles of my enslavement nor the limitations of my body made me feel limited. This might seem very strange to you, but let me explain.

Some things are within our complete control, while others are not. Within our control are judgment, desire, aversion, and whatever is of our own doing.

Not within our complete control are our body, our property, reputation, and whatever is not of our own doing.

That's because there are many external factors involved: illness, misinformation, and the impact of other people on us.

However, judgments and desires are internal to us, as we learned in the previous lessons.

But how should we deal with things like our health or our reputation? We can't really stop caring about them, but we can't guarantee that these things will turn out the way we want either.

We Stoics believe that we can't really fail in those things, as long as we are doing everything possible within our control. If they still go wrong, like due to you having an unexpected disease, it was not of your doing, so it's not a failure.

**Now, think of the last time you were afraid of failing, for example, public speech. How did you feel? How did it play out? Did you feel that you have complete control over the situation?**

We control far less than we might intially think, and we likely have mistaken ideas about what we control.

The problem is that by pursuing things that are not under control, we can't really control our happiness.

Let me give you an example.

It is like planning a sea voyage. What can you do? You can choose the captain, the sailors, the day, the right moment. Then a storm comes upon us. At this point, what are your concerns? Your part is done.

So choosing the captain was under your control, and weather conditions were not. So why would you even be bothered by the failure if it was not under your complete control?

What can you do in situations like that? Shift your goals from the external to the internal: repeat yourself that your objective is not to have a safe voyage but to do the best that is within your power to make it safe.

If you redirect your attention and desires in this fashion, you can't get disappointed that easily.

So let's do a quick exercise.

**Think of an important event you have soon. It might be a date or a public performance. What is under your control within this event? What is not?**

**Great. How can you focus more on things you control and pay less attention to something you can't?**

We should focus our energy and resources on affecting what we can control and turn away as much as possible from what we can't.

This boils down to the notion that we are in charge only and exclusively of our deliberate judgments, our endorsed opinions and values, and our decisions to act or not to act.

Nothing else.

I highly recommend doing this exercise daily, looking at specific events in your life. As you continue practicing, you'll internalize what is really under your complete control and what isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------

P.S. If you liked this exercise, I have written more lessons like that. Just in case you are curious to explore more: [**https://alter-ego.app/newsletter**](https://alter-ego.app/newsletter)

The themes I cover are: getting disciplined, reducing anxiety, learning about your life values, decision-making, the art of happiness, and being present in the moment.

The lessons are based on the primary sources of wisdom from more than 2500 years of history of philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Lao Tzu, Carl Jung, Stoics, and many others."
blackplotinus	2021-04-15 11:43:01+00:00	The Two Powers Of The Original Mantra And Its Perfected Breath	"The Original Mantra certainly isn't ""om"" like we boomers were told in the late-ish 1960's; and ""aum"", though much less wrong it fails us in much the same way. 

As such, had ""aum"" become the preponderant representation of the Sanskrit instead of ""om"", it too is every bit as likely to have engendered the same veritable oceans of understandable and **well-meaning embellishment, invention and personalization** .

The Original Mantra defines one particular phenomenon - the auditory cycle of a single, perfect, full and circular breath. It's the sound one deep exhale and its resultant inhale. It mimics that. 

It's what you hear in your head \[anyway\] when those two processes are taking place, it's easy to make the mantra the only thing you hear in your head and then to forget even the mantra until your alarm buzzes.

The Original Mantra is so perfect for meditation that it's ridiculously easy to explain. Ridiculously, astoundingly easy.

DancezWithMoose	2021-04-15 00:32:49+00:00	Three Things I've Learned in Two Years of Meditation	"Hi r/meditation. Long time lurker here, first time poster. As the title said, I’ve been meditating daily (~10 mins) for about 2 years now. Committing to a meditation practice has been one of the most positive life changing decisions I’ve ever made, and just wanted to share three of the most important insights I’ve learned in this time. 

1)	I am not my thoughts, and I think if you pay attention, you will realize that you are not your thoughts either.

If you’re like me, your default setting is to walk around completely absorbed in a continuous internal monologue. Most of us believe that this monologue is actually “us” in the first person sense. When you start to pay attention to your breath, and pay attention to thoughts as they arise, you quickly realize that your thoughts do just that: arise and pass away. They don’t have any more intrinsic meaning than any sight, sound, or smell that arises and passes away. Through meditation, I’ve finally paid attention to the fact that I am actually the space behind my thoughts, again in the first person sense. There is a deeper truth about the nature of consciousness to be discovered here that I won’t go into now, but suffice it to say this realization has allowed me to cut through many negative thoughts about myself and other people I have all the time. 


2)	Kindness, compassion, joy, and love are skills, not personality traits. 

I tend to be an introverted and melancholy person at baseline (again these are just thoughts I have about myself), and I have spent a lot of my adult life jealous of people like the Dalai Lama, Fred Rogers, and Bob Ross. People who walk around with a seemingly boundless capacity for optimism and joy, and who successfully dedicated their lives to spreading the joy they found in themselves. Through meditation (specifically metta, or lovingkindness meditation) I have learned that these are actually skills you can practice, not personality traits. Modern psychology tells us that happiness is both the 1) experience of positive emotions 2) sense of living a fulfilled life. Lovingkindness meditation has taught me the skills to improve my relationships with both the people closest to me and complete strangers, which has greatly improved my sense of a fulfilled life. I think we are taught by consumerist society that happiness is something to be obtained somewhere else, whereas through meditation I’ve learned that happiness is an intrinsic expression of undistracted consciousness. Which leads me to the third major lesson I’ve learned.


3)	The peace you feel during/after meditation can be felt ALL THE TIME. 

This has been a revelation for me. When I first began meditation I loved how calm and peaceful I felt during the practice and shortly after. Nearly two years later, however, I have come to know that this peace is actually the way our minds are when free of distraction, free from that continuous internal monologue. I believe this experience needs to be practiced to the point of stability, but all of us truly possess the capacity to live lives drastically free of unnecessary suffering. Ultimately, the point of meditation is not to become a good meditator. The point of meditation is to live a good life. 


If anyone is just starting on this journey, I implore you to continue your practice. Really the principles of mindfulness are based on a set of simple, testable, reproducible, and importantly experiential truths. Both the books Ten Percent Happier by Dan Harris, and Waking Up by Sam Harris, as well as their associated apps have been absolutely essential to helping me make this a sustainable part of my life routine. Thank you all for reading, have a great day!"

I wanted to ask about meditation in the context of the grieving process. There is this tendency in my mind after this loss, I think, to seek distraction whenever possible. To sit in silence invites the heartbreak to pound around in my head more than I'd like, but I also recognize that this is also a part of it all.

If possible, I would like to hear how meditation has helped (or possibly hurt?) you when it came to great loss in your life. Are there specific methods which are more beneficial under these circumstances?"

Since physical senses affect me deeply, and I couldn't hear myself breath, I was unable to. However, i then switched my focus to the spot on the center of my forehead. I could feel it throbbing, spinning, like a galaxy. Even though my focus, at first, was still all over the place, I eventually started feeling lighter, as if my body slowly became more and more etheral in nature. I'm very proud of this, of being able to sit still and focus even if for just some minutes, since i suffer from anxiety, depressive thoughts and constant insecurity.

I would like some advice from the veterans in this sub on how to continue with the habit, what thoughts and ideas to cultivate so I don't quit, and if I actually am doing it right.  


Thank you!"

I feel that this is just my ego coming up with irrational things and I am trying to be the observer and not give these thoughts a reaction. It’s just frustrating because I should be at the gym to better myself and focus on my workout and instead I’m focusing on these thoughts. Any tips?"

Tyratata	2021-04-14 18:49:04+00:00	"New to meditating, meditation brings me to my own personal hell"	"So I started meditating as I have suffered from uncontrollable anxiety for five years now and I also realized a lot of it comes from untreated adhd and also complex ptsd from my childhood. I also suffer from intrusive thoughts, since my anxiety ever since it got bad it has been manifesting itself through different themes all the time; health anxiety, emetophobia, fear of dying, fear of fainting, fear of psychosis, not being able to eat food because I thought I would choke everytime I swallow etc. Basically everytime I would naturally overcome an anxious thought, my mind would jump to new things to have anxiety over. Now, it is a fear of my own mind.

It's always derived from the same core issue, fear of losing control. Since my anxiety has been here for so long and seems to really want to be seen it just doesn't give up by trying to make my life as hellish as possible. So I get intrusive thoughts where I invision my own personal hell and I imagine shit from horror shows that has scared me. My anxiety and constant feeling of doom wants to be manifested through something always, and finds a ""host"" in a way. And the fear being of my own mind? It's horrible.

Often when I meditate (I use headspace, Andy's voice is the most reassuring thing ever) my mind takes me to those places. I try not to fight the urge to escape though, and I focus on the sensation of my breath while i let my mind think. Often it goes to my own personal hell, terrifying, sort of as if you would trip on psychedelics. 

Is this normal? Will this go away eventually? Any tips?"

Essentially a meditation group activity with gongs.

I attended one a few years ago and had a pretty intense experience. I could see the sounds of the gongs behind my eyelids, with different colours coming from the different gongs. Then near the end I pretty much left my body and found myself flying above what I can only describe as a ""snowy forest landscape"".

Has anyone else had any gong meditation experiences? Or experienced something similar perhaps without the gongs. I highly recommend it."

I am using the Headspace app and I am 13 days down, following the basic course. But one thing that sticks out is that whenever I try to focus on my breath, ALWAYS, there is some kind of background scenes playing in my mind. I don't know if it's natural or not. And the scenes are simple, not to complex but I want to achieve that undivided focus and attention. It happens even when I am trying to studying, some kind of totally random background scene will play in my mind even though I am working on my questions.

thegiam	2021-04-14 17:30:59+00:00	Headache that appears when meditating	"Every time I meditate (sitting and with my eyes closed) for more than 10 minutes I start to feel pain in a specific part of my head, on the left front, just above my left eye and a couple of centimeters inside. At about 15 minutes it is quite strong, and it does not seem to disappear with more time.

I believe it has something to do with the position of my body, since I remember it appearing sometimes also when trying to sleep on a plane. I can not really meditate lying down, since I get sleepy quite easily. In my everyday life I never really have headaches, they only appears when meditating.

Does anyone have some similar experiences, or any advice? I can power through it, but it does not allow me to concentrate on other things."

Doctors and Mystics alike have written and spoken about the benefits of Meditation and have given you many reasons to begin this Practice. In my small way, I have also tried to explain why in previous blogs.

I thought that I knew the answer.

But…

It is only right this moment as I drink my coffee that it hits me. The real reasons why I Meditate. The real reasons why you should Meditate.

As I drink my coffee, I find myself looking more and more forward to my morning Meditation. Actually excited. 

This surprises me. 

Yes, I have been meditating for over 30 years and love it but It came to me this minute that  I always saw it as a box to be checked in my day. One more thing done. A positive “thing”, a productive “thing” but just another “thing” that I do in my busy day. 

But my mind is blown as this minute:

I realize...

What a Luxury it is. What a Privilege it is. What a Gift it is. 

Time.

I realize that it is made even sweeter because it is a Luxury and a Gift that I give myself. A Privilege I grant myself.

I realize that it is the greatest act of self love and self care that there is. 

Time. 

A Time to Stop every day for just a little while, a Time to step off the Merry-Go-Round. A Time to learn about ourselves,  A Time to become intimately acquainted with ourselves, A Time to become and be our own best friend. 

A Time that belongs to Me.

How beautifully and gloriously Selfish."

bebelli	2021-04-14 15:21:59+00:00	Will meditating still have benefits if I'm on antidepressants?	"Hi there,
I'm a bit bummed because I tried to get off my antidepressant but went into severe withdrawal and had to go back on (was tapering but turns out I needed to go slower). I've been meditating here and there for 2 years but decided I wanted to go harder. So I'm trying to do 2x 20 minutes a day during the week and 3x 20 minutes a day on the weekend. 

When I stopped by antidepressant I felt sheer terror. Now back on the meds I feel as though a heavy blanket has been thrown over it. I can still feel in my chest that it's raw. I've kind of always felt that way. I've been practicing loving kindness the last few days  trying to comfort that part.

What I want most if the achieve a higher baseline than just OK. I want to really enjoy life. I want to feel my feelings of sadness and joy.  I want to be able to reach the fearful part and comfort it. 

Can I really realistically receive the benefits of meditation while I'm sort of blanketed by the meds?"

Compassionate_Wisdom	2021-04-14 14:49:31+00:00	Meditation taught me how to find center all day - Here is my mental process:	" · **Posture:** Spine straight and elongated as if string is holding up the body. Head tilted forward slightly looking out of the middle of the forehead. Tailbone tucked. Feet gripping the earth. Feel the energy radiating from your hands. See the full rainbow body in your mind’s eye and really feel it. Good posture allows the energy to flow better. Even when you cannot have a straight spine, at a minimum be fully aware of your body. Imagine you are breathing in and out of every pore of your body at once really helps, as it forces you to follow your breath. 

· **Relax the mind:** In the above posture, start to follow your breath as you breathe in and out slowly from your nose. Keep the focus on the breath as long as possible, coming back to it when thinking is not absolutely necessary (I am not convinced it is ever necessary, as the right answers just come to you in this state). Practice breathing deeply through the nose regularly. Be sure to keep the focus on the middle of the forehead. You will notice a tightening occur in this area. Allow it, you want it. 

o If you are unable to follow the breath without thoughts invading, **repeat this mantra:** Om Mani Padme Hum. 

o **Meaning:** To purify the body, mind, and speech through a combination of compassion and wisdom. Repeat this mantra using Sanskrit, it works better. 

· **Relax the body:** In the above posture, do a body scan and start relaxing everything from your hair to your toenails, checking every location. Get your body super loose. Stretch and do yoga in the morning. Stretch throughout the day as needed. Stretching will release stagnant energies from your body. 

· **Be Nice:** Think only in positive emotions and feelings. If this were the perfect scenario, how would you feel? Turn up the intensity (think “turning up the sexual intensity” but without the sexual, breathe deeply and get stoked to be alive – but remain centered and calm). All negative emotions are simply framing issues. Do positive things. High vibrational activities. The nicer the better. Always remain calm and centered, though. Excitement and anxiety are too sides of the same coin and will cause you to lose sight of your goal. 

· **Note**: Being “nice” means being nice to you too. You are the most important aspect of your Universe. You cannot help anyone if you cannot help yourself. So, make sure you put your personal growth, wellness, and happiness before all others. You are important to this Universe and worthy of many great things. But we all are important to the Universe. So, be nice to you while being nice to others. Win-win solutions are always possible. Losers are not a requirement in this Universe. Not considering your own or someone else’s feeling is a VERY LOW VIBRATION. 

· **Examples**:

o Motivate and inspire people to be their higher selves and achieve their dreams. 

o Tell the truth. Do not make up stories or exaggerate. 

o Help other beings. 

o Do not cause suffering under any circumstances. 

o If in an argument somehow, put yourself in their shoes. Deescalate. 

o Find win-win solutions.

o High vibrational foods only and basically just water. Lots of water. 

o Allow people to be who they need to be without judgement.

o Tell the Universe “I allow you to unfold for me.” 

o Listen to positive affirmations at 528hz. 

o If anxious &gt; tell yourself something positive and relax

o If scared &gt; reassure you are an eternal being and relax

o If addicted &gt; assure yourself of your divinity, you have been sober before and relax. 

o All feelings come and go with time. Transmute those negative energies. 

· **Intention/Focus:** What do you want? Its easy to lose focus if you do not know what you want. Figure out what you want. Admit you want it. Then take action to get those things. Write down what you want and tell yourself you have it with affirmations. Write it down, put it on your wall so you see it everyday. This will program it into your subconscious. 

o **What do you want?** Peace, love, and joy. Right? As long as you have those, you are happy. Stop worrying about what other people have.  

o **How do you get it?** Incorporate it into every aspect of your life. 

o **Repeat the mantra:** Om Mani Padme Hum

**I call this process**: Relax and Be Nice (or do high vibrational activities). You can use it in all situations. It works to improve every situation. Anytime you feel tense or uneasy &gt; relax and be nice. Feel free to DM if you want the full guide to this process, its free, but I wrote it for fun so please, use it as a resource, but always continue your spiritual education as this Universe is constantly changing, which means you need to always be present to see those changes."

I have been meditating for over a few months now and I think I am starting to get a glimpse and a feel for what the practice is about. I have been using the waking up app created by Sam harris, he does a great job in steering you in the right direction through his guided meditations. 

I know I shouldn’t be conceptualising too much but I am intrigued to know what I am experiencing currently and if it is a sign of progress. I am able place my awareness away from my thoughts to just below the centre of my chest bone and in doing so my inner monologue and thoughts are drastically reduced and I instantly feel centred, peaceful and present. If I notice I am lost in thought I simply ‘let go’ and place my awareness back in this place just below my breast bone.

Since I have been doing this I have been able to feel more and my senses are heightened. It almost feels like a home I carry with me, an inner peace that I can always place my awareness in and feel perfectly happy warm and fuzzy where ever I am. When my awareness is here it feels as though life is unfolding exactly as it should be and nothing needs to change. 

What is this? do I continue to place my awareness in this place in my walking life ? 

Thanks !"

That a vague depression is fine because its temporary but truly feeling and sitting within your emotions is bad.

Today, I listened to a sad song and sat by a stream. I admitted to myself that I missed my ex and that was okay to miss someone you will never see again. Like the stream, everything flows.

I have felt or made to feel less of a man for having emotions all my life. For the past few months, I have felt less of a meditator/Buddha, even if that wasn't directly taught , that's what I gleaned.

It's okay to feel anxious. 

It's okay to feel sad.

It's okay to miss someone.

It's okay. It is a part of you. Don't make meditation an excuse not to feel your emotions. 

DONT JUST RAIN - Recognize, acknowledge, Investigate, nurture.

Sviat-Hni	2021-04-14 11:37:40+00:00	The only practical meditation you need to make better decisions. Lesson from a former slave.	"Hi fellows! I'd like to share with you a practical exercise in a form of meditation from a stoic philosopher Epictetus. It helped me to become way more productive and make better decisions. I've framed it from his perspective, so he is a teacher here. Wish you a good read!

# Dichotomy of Control Exercise

Hi, I am **Epictetus**. I was born a slave in the Roman Empire and was crippled later on in life. This was terrible fortune and not of my own doing.

But neither the shackles of my enslavement nor the limitations of my body made me feel limited. This might seem very strange to you, but let me explain.

Some things are within our complete control, while others are not. Within our control are judgment, desire, aversion, and whatever is of our own doing.

Not within our complete control are our body, our property, reputation, and whatever is not of our own doing.

That's because there are many external factors involved: illness, misinformation, and the impact of other people on us.

However, judgments and desires are internal to us, as we learned in the previous lessons.

But how should we deal with things like our health or our reputation? We can't really stop caring about them, but we can't guarantee that these things will turn out the way we want either.

We Stoics believe that we can't really fail in those things, as long as we are doing everything possible within our control. If they still go wrong, like due to you having an unexpected disease, it was not of your doing, so it's not a failure.

**Now, think of the last time you were afraid of failing, for example, public speech. How did you feel? How did it play out? Did you feel that you have complete control over the situation?**

We control far less than we might intially think, and we likely have mistaken ideas about what we control.

The problem is that by pursuing things that are not under control, we can't really control our happiness.

Let me give you an example.

It is like planning a sea voyage. What can you do? You can choose the captain, the sailors, the day, the right moment. Then a storm comes upon us. At this point, what are your concerns? Your part is done.

So choosing the captain was under your control, and weather conditions were not. So why would you even be bothered by the failure if it was not under your complete control?

What can you do in situations like that? Shift your goals from the external to the internal: repeat yourself that your objective is not to have a safe voyage but to do the best that is within your power to make it safe.

If you redirect your attention and desires in this fashion, you can't get disappointed that easily.

So let's do a quick exercise.

**Think of an important event you have soon. It might be a date or a public performance. What is under your control within this event? What is not?**

**Great. How can you focus more on things you control and pay less attention to something you can't?**

We should focus our energy and resources on affecting what we can control and turn away as much as possible from what we can't.

This boils down to the notion that we are in charge only and exclusively of our deliberate judgments, our endorsed opinions and values, and our decisions to act or not to act.

Nothing else.

I highly recommend doing this exercise daily, looking at specific events in your life. As you continue practicing, you'll internalize what is really under your complete control and what isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------

P.S. If you liked this exercise, I have written more lessons like that. Just in case you are curious to explore more: [**https://alter-ego.app/newsletter**](https://alter-ego.app/newsletter)

The themes I cover are: getting disciplined, reducing anxiety, learning about your life values, decision-making, the art of happiness, and being present in the moment.

The lessons are based on the primary sources of wisdom from more than 2500 years of history of philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Lao Tzu, Carl Jung, Stoics, and many others."

Sadhguru and his Yogis at isha yoga center are minuplative people, they shape an image of them being trustworthy people but the truth is otherwise. You may wonder why i say this but keep reading and know the truth from my experience. Sadhguru and his yogis enter my body every day and minuplated me in many ways making me feel like a human experimant. They disconnect parts of my brain and connect it in ways to make my mind work against me in unexplainable ways making me anxious for hours. They use this technique and drain parts of my brain making me brain dead and to make me not be able to write about the truth every day. Sadhguru and isha yoga center yogis and monks also minuplate my emotion first by making me happy for minutes but its just a trick, i remember sadhguru saying if you work hard on somebody they can make you believe anything they wish and then they start minuplating my mind with new connections pushing my mind wishing i was dead and attempt suicide then they try to help me and play their trick on me again. One may wonder why i have fallen for this trick but it is simple, the simple answer is they keep disconnecting my mind till it i can't generate another thought and make me forget everything they did so i started writing notes talking about how they minuplate my daily life to not fall for this trap once disconnecting my mind. Sadhguru and isha yoga center use this technique before i meet with people trying to embarrass me in front of others and at my work place making me incapable of living a normal life generating my thoughts with energy and pushing on my brain daily so i had to give up living and had to write this for the world to see. Sadhguru and isha yoga center play also with my physical body as if the mind was not enough, they control my facial expression and my energy in ways any sane person would be startled to hear my story. They kept disconnecting my brain as i wrote this passage so im sorry if by the end of the truth if i am unable to continue but i am trying my best to let the truth be heard. I am a regular person not a guru nor a yogi but once a seeker of truth and tried to protect myself by messaging other yogis and gurus for their help from Sadhguru and Isha yoga centers evil wishing their was an escape but if it doesnt work this message will be sent. Sadhguru and isha yoga center also have minuplated me in a way where they press on parts of my brain making me say what they want. I have learned so much about the mind these past few months they have been killing me as sadhguru once said the best way to kill someone is by keeping them half alive that i can explain and tell everyone everything what they have done to me"
lumut1993	2021-04-14 06:59:37+00:00	I feel gratitude when being present in my daily tasks	"For example, before going to bed I undress, close windows, unfold my bed sheets... I used to do it the fastest I could because I used it to achieve a result. The result was being warm inside my bed.

&amp;#x200B;

As Echkart Tolle say, feel every moment and enjoy it, so I gave it a try, and I have no thoughts and feel gratitude while doing it. 

For example, when I'm unfolding my bed and touching my sheets, I feel gratitude for having sheets and also for living in this house. That gives me hapiness.

Also for example, taking a break in my remote job. I used to go to the kitchen, drink water, perform some stretching and then come back fast to work again, but going to the kitchen, feeling free to take a break, to work remote or even thankful to have a good job gives me hapiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this post is not about sitting and meditating, but I think meditation can be done everyday in every forms.

Thank you."

Few-End-1370	2021-04-14 04:51:09+00:00	A bizarre meditation experience?	"This is a meditation experience I’ve had and I was curious if anyone could give some more information on it?

I was in a convention and there was a meditation event going on so I went inside and sat down. I eventually laid down on the floor underneath the chair and relaxed. The sounds of the people talking in the room and the guy who was reading out the script for the meditation had completely silence from my mind and I was in a state of being conscious and unconscious. I could only see darkness and I could hear my own breathing and I stayed like that for quite a while. Whenever my friend woke me up out of the state, I looked around and everyone in the room had already left and we were the last people in the room. My body was ice cold as if I had been dead and I had a small/mini Hershey’s bar in my pocket which was melted before I went into the room and it was completely solid afterwards."
yvchawla	2021-04-14 04:29:10+00:00	Meditation is concentration of whole energy which is dissipated in seeking relief from compulsion of work or other irritations of daily life. It is the fusion of compulsion and relief that is the key to Fundamental Understanding.	"Living has become more and more a multi connected process. As you are using goods and services, almost everything produced by others. You have to work as compulsion to live, to procure goods and services you want or require. 

When you work as compulsion – you have to essentially seek relief through family, entertainments, religious-spiritual activities, ideas.

It is the fusion of compulsion and relief that is the key to Fundamental Understanding.

Whatever you may do in the name of spiritual practices or following any philosophies and so on, it all becomes a seeking relief device to cover up compulsion of work or other irritations, uncertainties you experience in daily life.

 One becomes so much attached to ‘relief’ offered by holidays, entertainment, religious and spiritual activities that one’s other days, other activities automatically become ‘compulsive’. This divide does not let one see ‘what is True’."

snorlaxerr	2021-04-09 21:02:32+00:00	Meditation has made me realize how much pressure I am putting on myself. For no reason at all.	"Meditation has made me become more aware of my wandering, stressful mind. Constant worry about the 5-6 things on my mind, everyday all day long. 

Years ago we used to be in school, our only worry for the following day to complete our homework. Once done, you can relax and play happily and enjoy the evening with you friends in the garden or park.

The garden has disappeared from my life, just because I wasn't letting my mind take a break.

Slowly, I am becoming more aware to be present in the moment, in the reality rather than be in my virtual thought world.
And I understand why meditation requires practice and patience, you need to build it up. Your thoughts can be more organized. 
Rather than worrying about things constantly, you can throw them in a time frame and tame them. Rest of the day, you relax.

I never intended to get any superpowers from it, this is more than super for me, for a stressful person who wasn't able to realize what was wrong with him. Hopefully it'll only get better hereon.

Since beginning to meditate regularly (last month or so), my dreams have gotten significantly more vivid. I do struggle to become lucid and always have. However, I have noticed that my dreams are now scary and nightmare-ish. 

One hears that dreams are your subconscious and that being kinder to yourself will turn negative dreams into more positive experiences. What are your thoughts?

Have any of your experienced this, and if so, did it get better from continued meditation? Is there anything specific I should try?

I have been studying meditation and try my best to focus on my breath and let thoughts go as they enter my mind. However, afterwards I don't feel any different. I don't feel more loving, calm, happy or a ""oneness"" as some people say. I don't experience any colors or visual changes during the meditation. Maybe I am doing something wrong or haven't given it enough time (about 6 months). Anyone else ever struggled with anything similar?"

endotronic	2021-04-09 19:08:08+00:00	Beginner that could use some advice	"Hello! I am a beginner to meditation, and I could use some advice. I would like to warn you that this post may require some patience. If you aren't feeling patient, please just disregard this.

I suffer from anxiety, and my partner, friend, and therapists are very often recommending I start a meditation practice. Everyone I know who is into meditation loves it. So, with these things considered, of course I feel like I should have a meditation practice.

The problem is that I try guided meditation every once in a while, and every time, I absolutely loathe it. Trying to slow my mind doesn't just seem impossible, it feels contrary to my entire value system. Additionally, the narrator in any recorded guided meditation frustrates and annoys me after just a few minutes. I find the tone of their voice very off-putting in my struggle. The one thing that does work for me is to focus on a single sound or motion, such as the sound of a fan or my own breathing. However, I can only focus on this for about three seconds before I have lost focus, and getting myself back on focus usually feels wrong, as the train of thought I just embarked on feels much more satisfying and much more important. When I do experience some success, it is quickly replaced by an anxious feeling that I must be forgetting something important.

There are some ""meditative"" practices I have that I enjoy. I spend a long time every morning making the best espresso I can, and since I have only one per day, it is a highlight. I have read that some people find showers to be meditative as well, but mostly when I shower my mind is flooded with embarrassing memories and self-loathing.

If anyone has struggled to get into meditation in this way, I'd love some advice. Thanks in advance."

axolotl91	2021-04-09 18:52:03+00:00	Now is the only time there is	"Time as an illusion didn’t sink in until recently. I was lying down thinking about something and whoosh came in a thought. It was very clear. It was a thought with a time label attached to it. That is, the thought itself had no labels, but another mini-thought came in and labelled the thought as past.

In that moment, I understood what the meditative traditions have been saying about psychological time. It is not real. It only exists when you think about it. When I remember the past, it comes into being. I’m the one giving it any semblance of life. I cannot touch, feel, play and dance in past or future. It only exists when I label a thought as past or future. The thought itself has no time. It is the remembering that the event occurred in the past that reifies time.

When I look at my plant, past only comes in when I remember it was shorter a year ago. When I eat ice cream, time only comes in when I remember how it tasted before. When I see my nephew, time only comes in when I remember how much he’s grown since the last time I saw him.

When ‘observing thoughts’ im either identified with a thought, meaning im caught up in it, or not having a thought at all. It feels like ‘having’ a thought and ‘observing’ it at the same time, is impossible. Maybe i can switch fast between observing and having, but it seems to me like pure observing, as recommended in mindfulness or anapanasati, like leaves in a river, is simply not doable, like something that seems simultaneous but isnt. I can determine right after a thought i HAD a thought, not during. Anybody have the same doubts while meditating?"

For a moment I felt hopeless and somewhat sacred. But after I let go of this feeling, I suddenly remembered that this is what I was looking for. The realization that everything is not permanent.
And now I feel no fear, no anger, ego disappeared. Maybe I was able to let go only for a moment but what a beautiful moment of absolutely letting go of everything.

Also, a feeling of caring for others strongly appeared.

Thats been going well but something in me wanted to have a look into other forms of meditation. Recently I've found out about Isha Kriya and I'm not sure if you can do both or if it's not okay to mix them. I've tried researching but I can't find anything that tells me. If any one knows I would love to learn about these two being used together. 

If it helps to know, I'm currently healing in general from past experiences and my goal is to feel peaceful, vibrate at a positive frequency and maintain a mindset of abundance

Essah01	2021-04-09 14:45:39+00:00	do you guys think meditation can be stressful?	"First of all I am not new to meditation, just so you guys know that I have a basic understanding of it. I would do it from time to time and these days I am doing 2 or 3 sessions which are around 15 minutes long. I certainly enjoy meditating and it helps me to be present, as I am a daydreamer and have frequently spontaneous thoughts which are quite distracting.

As much as I like meditation it certainly feels like mental calisthenics.  I find myself distracted while meditating and bring my attention back to my breath. I accept those thoughts in my mind and I just watch the passing by like the clouds in the sky, so I dont suppress anything or lets rather say I try.  As I meditate this happens quite frequently, which is presumably normal I would guess, but I feel a bit stress or mentally exhausted one can say during the meditation after a while. Once I am done I feel pretty relaxed and calm most of the time.

so my questions are am I overdoing it? or is there even something as overdoing it if we talk about meditation?

What do you guys think about it? What is your guys understand of it and did any of you experience something similar?"

Today I interview Philip wade from Gateway Location. Philip attained a state of self-realisation many years ago and today he shares his experience with us and explains how self-realisation is open to each and every one of us as this is already our true self / our true nature….

“Infinite Silence is absolute, before time, before space, before concept, before the universal beingness of I AM.

It is made manifest in Infinite Variety. Your form is like a facet of a diamond. You are the facet and the whole diamond at once! Infinite Silence is that which YOU truly are! Your divine essence. It is absolute and the animating principle of All that IS. IS = Infinite Silence”.

PuddleCreek	2021-04-09 09:28:41+00:00	"How do I - a person with acute anxiety and depression, stop turning away from the light?"	"Hi. I've been struggling with acute anxiety and depression for a year now. I had - and still have, but to a lesser degree - mental issues and was unintentionally harming myself. I tried my best to resolve life and health issues which I had and still have and became a neurotic and obsessed with order and discipline - I tried to control everything, as much,  as I could. I forced myself too much, I resisted too much. Underweight and with 147\\97 chronic blood pressure, I felt how life slowly leaves my body. I felt that I will give up soon, but neurotic part of me resisted. 

One important thing is that while I was obsessed with order and control, I didn't have bad intentions in mind. I was sure that my goal and my attempts are noble. I always kept others in mind. I just wanted everything to be alright. So I pushed myself to work hard to achieve this. And one day, 2 months ago, mother nature has taken care of me...

There's a story in the Bible about a man who was warned by God that his town is gonna burn down and God told him to follow him and not to turn back on burning town or he will turn into stone. ""Follow It and don't turn back or you are a stone..."" - popped up in my mind. I froze. I sat on the floor in the hallway unintentionally and saw everything unfolding in front of my eyes - thought by thought, action by action. I was pulled out of hell and brought back to life, step by step. Now I knew the meaning of almost every Buddhist, Taoist and Christian passage that I read. Now I knew what ""The Matrix"" and ""Mr. Nobody"" were about(I'm aware that I'm ignorant though).

I'm trying to follow it since then. But if someone asked me how to achieve this, how ""to enter"" here, what would I say? - Give up? Stop trying? Stop resisting? I can only loosely explain this and that's the problem - ""It"" is not always with me.

As I said, I'm suffering from acute anxiety and depression. I have panic attacks and then I'm going around seeking for the ways to feel better or to hide from it, not to let terrible thoughts to come in. Being in that state - of ""following it"" - to me is the only way to exist. I know that you will advice me to take my time, to be patient etc., - and that's a good advice, because just 2 months has passed. I know that mistakes are unavoidable and I'm learning bit by bit. But since I'm anxious, every mistake costs me 100 fold.

I want to describe it in more detail. I have samadhi every day and in that state everything is fine. Sometimes I can remain in samadhi for day, sometimes It's just a couple of hours. Now I'm in it and I use this opportunity to write this post in a calm and concentrated state of mind. I know how to get there intuitively, but I keep ""forgetting""(I hope you know what I mean by forgetting.) And when that happens - when I forget - I feel that hell slowly comes again at me. Every trivial thing seems like a monster to me - like an unbearable burden. It all accumulates and I'm overwhelmed by that. I'm in chaos. Then I wish I could escape, but I realize that I can't escape from that, because It's always inside of me - and this thought strucks me really hard. So I have samadhi throughout the day, I go to bed and in the morning it usually disappears(I know the relation between sleep and loss of samadhi). Then I just have to ""wait"" it to come back - some 2-3 hours, but those 3 hours are as I described. And there's always a chance that I lose it somewhere in the middle of the day(when I made a mistake) and It happens again.

I'm not interested in alternative forms of meditation, unless they would assist my discipline or attention span moreso than the basic practice."

"Sometimes I will be listening to music, and it will be playing, but I'll be so deep in meditation that I won't hear it at all.  I'll become aware of this, and still not hear the music, until I actually look at the device showing my music playing and sort of 'snap out of it.' 

When I had ego death a couple years ago, I lost ALL of my senses and became pure consciousness awareness itself, beyond the confines of space and time, but that's another story..."

It has long been known that meditation can lower blood pressure and helps with depression and anxiety. In addition, meditation clears the mind and releases resistance, which in turn allows your desires to start flowing more naturally to you. As a bonus, meditation creates a fertile state for imaginative ideas to flow from inside.

There are many types of meditation practices. A comprehensive description of the types of meditation would take a great deal of time. Instead, I will talk about some simple meditations that a busy person might use in this article. I will also present a simple mindfulness meditation that can be used. It will be up to you to explore further and decide upon a meditation practice if you so choose. [Read More](https://www.tectalk.co/using-meditation-with-your-law-of-attraction-practice/)"

I recently started meditating and first few days were the happiest I’ve felt this year. 
I was smiling and happy the whole day. But due to some unforeseen events, I’ve been again pushed down the road of anxiety, stress and depression. Still i try to meditate every morning, but I’ve noticed I can’t concentrate on my meditation compared to what i used to do previously. 


I need meditation now more than ever. I am in a lot of stress state and meditation can help but I can’t do it and i really want to. I do 3/4 minutes and even that are not of a good quality. 

Please advice me on how to be better and improve. 


Thankyou"

Mtl2003	2021-04-09 03:32:37+00:00	Powerful Benefits of Meditation.	"Meditation is the art of silencing the mind. When the mind is silent, concentration is increased and we experience inner peace in the midst of worldly turmoil. This elusive inner peace is what attracts so many people to meditation and is a quality everyone can benefit from.
we provide five interesting facts about meditation.
01. Meditation makes you happier.
02. Meditation helps you manage anxiety, stress and depression
03. You needn’t be a religious person to meditate.
04. Meditation helps you fall asleep.
05. Meditation sharpens your memory.

Apart from enhancing your happiness and improving your overall well-being, meditation also helps your memory stay sharp and your concentration remain steady. With mindfulness meditation, you train in remaining aware of the present moment in a non-judgmental manner. Consequently, distractions are less and less likely to sweep you away. This is another reason why you should meditate."

"So as far back as I can remember I've been able to cause my whole body to experience a really intense ""tingling"" sensation just by focus. It's not exactly tingling, more a really sudden weak feeling with some amount of ""feel good"" energy about it.

I'm not exactly sure how I'm inducing its just a reflex like moving a muscle. I can't hold it for too long because it becomes it dies out too quickly. It isn't painful or anything. It's more pleasurable than painful but not exactly that either. It definitely doesn't feel like an adrenaline rush either. I'm just wondering if there is any one else out there like me that can do this and if you maybe have a theory or information of whats taking place? I just find it fascinating, maybe even rare, but who knows."

Recently I've been getting a lot more incite and it has really improved my meditation practices as well as just life overall. I won't bore you with what I've learned but I've noticed I have been very mindfull all the time now. When I meditate I used to get this super clear headed feeling with this euphorical, peaceful, everything is alright type of buzz. Now after I meditate it just feels normal. Tbh I feel much happier but also withdrawn in a sense. It's not dissosaciation either. Like I'm aware what everything is and it feels the same but I just don't know how to explain it..... I've thought about posting this multiple times but I can find a way to describe it. It's like I can get to this state normally where I have no judgment but also no personality. I'm never stuck like this and I can function and act normal but it's just diffrent. It's also weirdly peaceful at the same time. 

Also I feel like my heads up my own ass more. What I mean is that when I talk to people I feel like I can be condescending. I don't know if I was always like this and now im just more aware of it or what. But I have noticed most people who get into spirituality tend to be the same way."

For example -&gt; “I am not my thoughts” “isn’t this just a thought.” “Why are more thoughts popping up” “I am not my thoughts” “why can’t I believe that these thoughts aren’t me?” “These are also just thoughts.” “What if I’m doing this wrong?” 

Why would I want to generate more thoughts and take my mind away from the present moment? It doesn’t make any sense to me and no matter how many times it’s been explained to me it never will

I would personally recommend breath, sound or loving kindness meditation. Those are much more relaxing and easier to grasp"

But the ego is too scared now to stop that habit (i studied the ego ""deeply"" so ik all of this), he's too scared of change bc he feels safe and he's coming back stronger and stronger. Now idk what to do, choose the higher self and gives up that habit or choose the ego, keep that habit and probably will cry again bc of guilty, thoughts, etc.

I don't know what to choose really my ego is coming back stronger and stronger, he's actually here while i'm writing this soo ://

*thymus, I feel is an underestimated glandular organ. Too important to overlook, so I aim to precisely ""activate"" it as well.

** psychic center, just going off of that GreatDreamz webpage, but I am willing to tout this; legit, I lend my faith. Also note how there is a 32hz difference from throat.

Origins - EARTH: 250.56hz — for 12-16mins, Vowel; HHAUUH

Base - ROOT: 256hz — for 10-12mins, Vowel; UUUHHH

Essence - SACRAL: 288hz — for 8-10mins, Vowel; UOOOHH

Power - SOLAR PLEXUS: 320hz — for 6-8mins, Vowel; AAAAUH

Order - HEART: 341.76hz — for 5-7mins, Vowel; AAAAHH

{Format? - THYMUS} * : 352.64hz — for 4-6mins, Vowel; AAEAAEAAEA

{Astral Center? - UNKNOWN} *** : 512hz / 524.8hz — 1-2mins, Vowel; HHEENG

*** astral center, based on my estimation that there WOULD be a further along major chakra point resonating at either 32hz OR 43.52hz (21.76 ×2) beyond crown, 480hz. It is also worth noting that the difference between Earth &amp; Root is 5.44, which is 1/4 of 21.76.

0000000000000000000000000000000000

After performing this exercise, I feel amazing. Very clear minded &amp; peaceful.

A thought came to me after completing the exercise today. I was recalling the enticing mild closed eye visual patterns I was seeing midway through, &amp; thought of how, ordinarily, I would not be viewing this marvelous experience as I was during the exercise. I compared this to how, while crossing the eyes, one would not be able to correctly perceive with their vision; the sight would be imbalanced, &amp; so dysfunctional. Similarly, I think this might explain why I was able to see these hallucinogenic patterns of light &amp; color while balancing my breath &amp; subtle movements by harmonizing with these tones which represents the frequencial resonance of chakras within the body. Imagine that the bodies energies are misaligned, or else, ""cross-eyed"". So long as this is the case, inward perception will operate dysfunctionally until the energies are focused into more accurate alignment. 

Well, I hope I can encourage some of you to try this for yourselves, but I don't expect much. Take care."

The ""thought machine"" was particularly active that day and as I was tracking the breath and observing said thoughts, I noticed that they started to take a curious form. At my girlfriend's behest, she and I have been watching a lot of Grey's Anatomy lately, and I noticed that every cycle through the breath, my mind would form a random scene with Grey's Anatomy characters. There was no cohesion to it, simply a character would pop up and speak some incoherent line to another character. Then, I would focus on the in-breath, and by the time I was breathing out, my mind had formed a new scene with different characters. This went on for a while--there are plenty of characters to work with on the show. I think eventually it shifted to characters from House.

I couldn't help but chuckle internally, like ""This is the mind that I listen to all day? The one that plays dress-up with TV characters and speaks gibberish just to avoid the silence?"" Anyway maybe some of you might enjoy this little anecdote, especially if you've seen the show. Peace!"

# The Benefits of Meditation: How Meditation Can Improve Your Life

The Benefits of Meditation: How Meditation Can Improve Your Life this can change your whole life quality so don't scroll with out reading it, I promise it will change your life!

## The Basic Benefits of Meditation

Meditation is an excellent and profound technique which, of course, can benefit people who suffer from anxiety, high blood pressure, etc. One way to improve our health is to keep up our exercise routines and stay physically fit. And, of course, don’t forget to keep a stress management plan. Another benefit of keeping a normal exercise schedule is to keep blood pressure in control and blood sugar levels under control. However, the best known way to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular diseases is to practice meditation. Meditation is also known to be effective for depression and obesity. It has also been found that meditation is particularly effective for reducing anxiety and depression.

## How to Get Started

Now some of you have never taken a single step in your life that you were not positive about before, you know you have it figured out and always get the answers you need before asking your partner. And others of you are living proof that becoming the top spot on the pyramid is not an easy task, and that it takes determination and effort, it takes a tremendous amount of effort, stamina, and knowledge to get to the very top. And not only is the top spot at the top the only one that can grant you happiness but you know that each day, every single day, that you find that peaceful and relaxing spot you are an untouchable entity.

## Meditation Techniques

I find that not only is meditation wonderful for improving your life, it helps you strengthen your mind as well. Here are 3 ways meditation can improve your life: First of all, meditation can improve your sleep. There are a number of studies showing that those that meditate have lower amounts of deep sleep, which is crucial for maintaining the health of your brain. And your brain does a lot of things during deep sleep, from processing new information to clearing out toxins, and all of this is done with ease through meditation. The most beneficial meditation style is still the most basic, just sitting and watching your breath while you think about nothing in particular. Meditation has also been found to improve your memory.

## Conclusion

The Benefits of Meditation: How Meditation Can Improve Your Life Mindfulness is one of the greatest tools for changing your mindset and outlook on life as a person, i've experienced this first hand. Now it's all about you to decide how you want to use it for your life, and how can you put it to the best possible use."

"A lot of the spiritual teachers I like espouse the idea that we are not our thoughts and emotions in some way, shape, or form and I do believe that. I believe that we are the God Self, spirit, soul, consciousness, awareness, whatever you want to call it. The spiritual teacher Mooji sometimes calls it the ""isness"". However, there seem to be two types of thoughts, or at least there are for me. The involuntary ones that make up the river of thought that runs through my consciousness and the thoughts I'm thinking as I write this. Thoughts that seem as though they are directed and focused by this consciousness. So then my question is am I these focused thoughts? Are they part of that ""isness"" or merely a tool used to express conscious intent?"

Sokolowskierj	2021-04-08 14:08:35+00:00	A quick case for sticking with it	"Hello everyone, I just wanted to share my experience and recent breakthrough with meditation.

I have been meditating for about two years now, most consistently over the last year with the Waking Up app. I stuck mostly to 10 minute guided meditations prior to bed, 4-5x/week. While I feel like they helped me relax at times, I never really 'got it'. I would just continually get lost in thought, and every time the guided meditations had me focus on something related to 'finding' the self, or lack thereof, it never clicked. I thought this was all mediation had to offer me and I was OK with it.

This morning I had enough time (20 min) prior to work to meditate. On a whim I did a timer only vs a guided mediation, so it was both longer and open ended. The first 10 minutes was the usual - lost in thought, trying to ground myself with the breath. Then something amazing happened - without really trying - the boundary between my body and space had completely dissolved, 'I' was no longer a cohesive entity, but one with my surroundings, sounds, sensations, etc. I was in this state for about 5 minutes but it felt like an hour. 

When my timer went off, I felt like I had just come out of a strange trip, and I still have this nice 'glow' about myself. 

My takeaway from this experience is to stick with your practice, even if you don't think you're 'getting it'. Deviating away from guided meditations and going longer was a catalyst for something to 'click' for me. I am not going to try to necessarily recreate this state, but it is just nice to now that this altered state of consciousness exists and it is very pleasant &amp; achievable."

I'm posting this to request your help in moderating our community. Since I joined the team here two years ago, the subreddit has more than doubled in size. We now average approximately 2 million page views per month, with about 600 new subscribers every single day. I'm incredibly pleased that we are able to reach such a large audience, however, with growth comes growing pains. As any regular reader will know, spam and hostility remain large issues in our community. Despite our best efforts, myself and /u/theturbolemming sometimes feel like we're drinking from a fire hydrant. We need your help to prune our little tree of a community and help it to grow in the right direction. 

I've written a short questionnaire that I'll link below. It should take you about 20 minutes to fill out, but there is absolutely no rush to finish it quickly. As the subreddit implies, I would very much appreciate your thoughtful consideration and reflection rather than a hurried response. 

https://forms.gle/x6iLWd8o4PeAvzBx6

I'll leave the form open until the end of the month so that everyone who wants to apply will have the chance. Please be sure to include your reddit username and the time zone that you live / will be moderating in.

" I wanted to take a second and thank everyone that contributes to this community, I am fairly new but have found the questions, answers and information to be informative and enlightening. With that said on to the question. I find that I have fairly intense performance anxiety and part of the work I'm doing with my instructor is to improve my mental focus while I'm playing so that I am more objective and less emotional when an error occurs. My goal is to ensure time is not wasted on emotional response in the correction of the error. I'm curious if anyone has any meditative practices or tricks they have found that have helped them improve their focus and reduced their emotional investment when mistakes occur. Thank you all in advance for your help!"

When I put any pressure at all on it/him/her I get nowhere.....

But as soon as I stop EXPECTING it to do/be something or waiting/ watching - **BINGO!** 

I suddenly find myself being acquainted with my soul/God or whatever you want to call it.... 

So - my conclusion is this:

I cannot meditate with any goal in mind (which is counter-intuitive for a human).... but the soul seems to be reward me when I want **NOTHING FROM IT! : D** 

**So - I think this means don't meditate for a result, but meditate for love and the journey will take care of itself...**"

Creators are living and walking these planes within the enlightened sanctuaries of their hearts. 

There is no right and no wrong in a world where you are releasing vibrations of patterns that don’t serve the whole. The Light of God peaks over the horizon. Warmth floods into your being from beyond. 

The human mind can’t comprehend the invisible infinite. 

The heart soars to the voice of the Angel That you have come to know as your soul. The calling is so strong that lives change. 

The empowerment of Source comes when unsuspecting souls embrace the beauty of Love. The Heavenly pastures are not a dream, they are where you come from. The soul finds home with every loving heartbeat. 

Every flush of anger tears you away. 

In this infinite ocean the world is born. Don’t forsake your calling over the pettiness of other people’s minds. They don’t control you, they are animated by the same wounds that brought you here. 

Awaken. 

Wake up the God within. 

Source has no bounds. 

Feel the immensity of every Sun. 

You are the reason this world exists. 

It will flash out of existence. Arise. 

Ignite your heart to the infinite of everything that is.

When I am in judgement mode, or self conscious it is like my attention is narrower in a small 'ball' in my head - between the brows.

The opposite to this - when I sit, it is like a more open expanse in my brain.  Like the boundaries are breaking down.  And this goes for when I am off the cushion too; I feel less anxious, I identify less with negative feelings, and am more absorbed in what I am doing.

Just an interesting thought."

paralysisofchoice	2021-04-08 10:03:53+00:00	I had an anxiety attack while meditating and I’m too afraid to meditate again	"Title says it all. I’ve been meditating daily for about 3 months and had an anxiety attack a week ago. It was reminiscent of a feeling I experience pretty consistently - what’s known as ‘fast feeling’ or Tachysensia. There’s a subreddit where those who experience it gather r/fastfeeling

I experienced the regular ‘fast feeling’ as well as a dry and almost brittle feeling on the skin all over my body. I tried to ride it out and simply explore the feeling, but it was too much and my heart began racing so I had to stop. To end it I usually call my dog in to pat or have a drink. It’s the first ever time I’ve done it while meditating - I can usually do it by reading or during night terrors. I’m certain it isn’t an impingement on a nerve as I’ve experienced it while both sleeping and sitting. I think it’s purely psychological.

Does anyone have any tips on how to avoid it? I’ve been through a pretty bad depressive episode and meditation provided one of my only respites."
ihaphleas	2021-04-08 09:33:47+00:00	"How I used to ""meditate"""	"I used to meditate by listening to my breath, by counting my breath, by looking at a wall ... various ways ... letting thoughts and emotions come and then going back to my breath.

However, reading The Disowned Self, I realise that I have a lot of repressed emotion. I have used meditation, and other subconscious techniques to try to escape the pain of some of my emotions ... and even consciously tried to feel less emotion in general for a while.

What I have not done is sit and let myself feel, not just ""let the emotion/thought pass away,"" which was really me pushing the thought away, but to let it stay. To allow myself to actually feel it, to realize that there are no evil thoughts or emotions (though there may be evil acts), to fully accept my emotions and then allow myself to examine why and move past it.

Do some of you do the same? Is your ""letting the thought pass away"" actually repression of emotions you refuse to confront, perhaps something you consider ""evil"" within yourself?

Do some of you allow some of your meditation to be a listening and feeling and accepting and examination of your emotions?"

I'm just interested to hear from anyone elses perspective.

I have been meditating on and off for a couple of years now and it has very much helped me with letting things go and flow a lot easier. I had mental health issues in the past and meditation has come a long way to alleviate them.

Now, I am a manager at work who needs to be assertive and put their point across in a no BS way. I struggle to feel the anger to feed into assertiveness, especially if it's some I need to bring up with my team on a future date. This can make me appear too laid-back and passive. 

Does anyone have and insight on how to balance the zen of a meditative life and needing to hold onto feelings for the benefit of work or any other walk of life.

Many Thanks"

Well to think you are communicating with a GOD is DUALITY and you mix that with emptiness you are going to get a wrong result.

Now for the western atheist who thinks reality was just randomness come together by chance to create beings and this world that is also going to have a negative result when mixed with the truth nature of reality aspect called ""emptiness"" which is contrary to that randomness belief system."

I don’t know if I even do it right but this time was different than others. After sometime into it I was able to observe my thoughts very clearly. Some of my thoughts are in words, most were in images that quickly go away after I spot them. I tried bringing my focus back to my breathing but my thoughts kept coming back so fast that I get lost in them, forgetting to focus on my breath.

One thing I that’s new is that I noticed something I can’t describe too well. Best I can say is that it’s either my intuition or something like it. There were no words or images to those thoughts, just a clear feeling.
I forgot what those thought were though(Bad memory/ADHD).

I haven’t felt any emotions while meditating.
Or maybe I did but I’m disconnected from them.

I could be saying/explaining this wrong. Or not know enough information to make my experience any clearer.
So if anyone wants to ask questions lmk."

I’ve been meditating for about 8 months now. I had always done it lying down since I found I could relax a lot easier. I had never really fallen asleep in the process until recently, my work loads been getting heavier so I’ll pass out almost 10 mins in. Decided it was time to switch over to the legs-crossed-apple-sauce style but it’s killing me. My back and ankles gets sore, and I find I’m so focused on keeping a good posture that it gets in the way of actually “letting go”. 

*Anyone that knows me personally knows that my normal posture makes the hunchback of Notre dame look like a total amateur. Definitely saw switching as an opportunity to change that around.*

Naturally I’m frustrated that I can’t get anywhere near I could when I used to lie down, but I’m slowly getting better. I know the answer is practice, practice and more practice, but I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience when changing positions. 

Thank you in advance

I realized after months of shoving it down that the only way out of it was through it, so I’ve been doubling down on meditation

It’s brought me calmness and all the expected benefits, but it wasn’t until today that I felt like I had a serious breakthrough. I was meditating and suddenly had an extremely vivid vision of me giving myself a hug. I hugged myself so hard and said “it’s going to be ok. You’re going be ok” and then felt myself giving that hug, and receiving that hug. 

I wept during it because I just felt so loved and so comforted. This may sound crazy, but it was just so so so beautiful and I wanted to share it here. Keep going."

For me at that time it’s so easy to trace backward what have I done in those 5 min action by action, place by place, until I found that item.

And also as I remembered everything happened in childhood got a very intimate/close/intense feeling with me that makes me connect deeply with them, so it may contribute to a better memory.

But now I’m 29 years old, I found myself can’t even remember what have I done in previous 5 min. A lot of things happening at the same time, seems like I don’t even have time to let every single thing sink a little bit, cannot getting back that intimacy with things.

"I meditate each morning before getting out of bed so I start my day off right. I typically feel great after meditating and always resolve to maintain my equilibrium. However, too many days I don't even make it to school drop off in the morning before I have completely lost my center. I will calmly redirect my kids many times but once they start yelling and I have to yell just to be heard I am done. 

I've tried getting them to meditate too but they complain about it. I take recentering breaths when I feel myself losing it but that only helps for a while. I have a big family so even if a couple kids are behaving someone else is always acting up and trying to rile everyone else up."

It moved me immensely, and I lost it almost right away cuz I burst into tears. (I try to only observe during meditation so I let those feelings run their course.) It felt like small fingerlings of thin roots, branching off and pulsing down my arms and ending at my finger tips.. But rather than feeling it in a tactile external sense I could feel it within me, yet also larger than life in my hands and fingers, I guess because there's so many nerves there? I feel stunned.

MagicUnicornCock	2021-04-07 23:52:24+00:00	"Your methods for getting an answer. (And the old ""the questions are irrelevant"" deal.)"	"I know, I know, people say ""meditation teaches you the questions are irrelevant?"". I've searched old posts in this sub. This might be totally the wrong place to ask for that reason.

And I see that most nights when I go to sleep too. I go to the real world, and there I think ""Why am I so stressed out about that world that isn't even real? Why am I so desperately trying to see the light in that world, and get answers to my questions when it's not even a real world?"" 

Problem is, down here in this lowly not-real world, that doesn't mean anything. It doesn't help. I'm still trapped down here for 16 hours a day. I know the whole time this is not real (I really go my whole days with this knowledge), but that doesn't mean I can control it. That doesn't mean I know how to override the game. My world is a prison where money is the thuggish warden who rules my life. 

The old ""the questions are irrelevant"" doesn't help when my landlord's kicking us out, selling the house, I can't afford to rent my own place, and the only options that have presented themselves are  a joke to me. It doesn't help when I fear I'm going to be jobless soon due to a ridiculous working situation where something's gotta give?

This might be a not-real world, but when the man comes to cut off your electricity, you can't just say ""I know you're not real. Don't touch that box. I banish you from my existence!"". Or can you? (The people I live with twice thought they could not pay their share of the power, thinking I'd somehow sort it. I was worse off financially than them, and actually going slightly hungry at the time. The power got cut off a second time before they saw ""you really have to pay for power"".) 

SO, can we put aside the condescending ""I'm so spiritual"" talk to discuss things you've found that help when you need answers? Especially methods that don't require discipline.

For little things I find I can put it down, let go, confident the answer will come, and it does, because I have no serious attachment to it. If it's not money/food/shelter, it doesn't matter so much. For big things, they swirl round my head in anguish, and I just can't seem to let them go.

There's always one default, no-decision option that stands out among all paths for me, and that's the one I always take, short of answers. It doesn't give me an easy life."

I’m 26/F and just started my meditation “journey”. I struggle with some mild anxiety/depression and racing thoughts about the future. 

At the suggestion of my therapist that I try antidepressants I flipped out and downloaded a meditation app. I think considering ive never done it before, I’m halfway decent. But my thoughts definitely tend to wander a lot. I HAVE experienced a much easier time falling asleep however, and a general feeling of relief from my psychological pity party (depression). 

So far I’ve done various body scans and one I did today was actually to allow my thoughts to wander, and to assign them “past” or “future” before redirecting back to my breathing. 

I guess my question is when it gets better? Does anyone know how long it took them to realize the meditation was coming easier to them"

I lose concentration and focus when someone is speaking and my mind wanders off, thats the reason I'm learning to meditate . Can I listen to these types of music while I'm meditating or should i just be mediating in silence and be focusing on my breathing?"
IrohLotus	2021-04-07 22:59:37+00:00	How to stop avoiding meditation due to pain?	"I've often subconsciously avoided meditation over 5-ish years I've been meditating. I noticed it's likely because meditation helps me stop and see the physical pain my body is constantly in. This is due to my nature of physically expressing and holding emotions in my body e.g. anxiety and fear through tension in my kneck and scalp etc. I usually end up avoiding it until I become a completely overwhelmed and then meditating excessively once, rather than consistently.  


How do I meditate even in these times? They are likely the times I need to meditate the most."
Criticism-Witty	2021-04-07 22:47:17+00:00	WHAT DID I JUST EXPERIENCE 🤯	"Around 4 years ago when i was 18. I discovered meditation. Since then I've been practicing on and off... A few weeks straight followed by months of no meditation then the cycle continues.

But the past 2/3 weeks have been very consistent almost twice a day 5/6 days a week. 

Today I just finished a 15 minute session whilst feeling extremely tired. The way I practice meditation is by keeping god in mind and being grateful for his guidance. I usually chant ""Waheguru"" in my head repeatedly until the minds voice gets tired and can no longer say it.

So I got to a point where there was just emptiness (about 10 minutes in).. No noise just light awareness , a few moments of no thoughts just being present and basking in nothingness... As soon as i realised what I was experiencing a few seconds later my upper spine literally rolls forward a couple of centimetres and it felt as though I shifted into a completely different reality. Time literally felt distorted and it felt almost like 30 minutes. 

Can anyone explain what happened? It was so blissful and pure and felt so right like that moment was where I am meant to belong. Its almost like a high i want to chase again!"

nothinglasts43v3r	2021-04-07 21:51:10+00:00	Can meditation help heal trauma in ways that are similar to psilocybin?	"A few months ago I took 4 grams of mushrooms. This wasn’t my first time but it was a pretty nice experience. The come up had me thinking I was going crazy and it was filled with anxieties. Tre trip itself was an introspective one. During the comedown I felt super blissful as if all my worries were healed and melted away. I felt lighter and realized that stressing over the things that have already passed is pointless. 

Everyone has trauma. It doesn’t have to be heavy trauma such as being the victim of a robbery. It can also be someone being made fun of in front of their classmates. I believe it becomes trauma when we don’t allow those experiences of what happened to pass through. Instead, we constantly think about them and make the experience out to be more than what it was. We cling onto that idea, which then causes suffering. 

After my trip was over, I felt like my trauma was healed. I felt goofy and lovable idk how else to explain it really. I felt like a kid. 

Here’s the thing though. I’ve been wanting to get sober for awhile now. I meditate everyday but somehow I feel like I’ll never have another experience like the ones I’ve had on shrooms. Part of me wants to go sober but use shrooms as a therapeutic treatment only. But if I can get to that same place of healing by only meditating then I’m all in. Can any advanced meditators relate or offer advice?"
ShouldBeInMySpace	2021-04-07 21:48:49+00:00	My experience meditating for the past two years	"Hey all, here’s just a spontaneous write up on how meditation has made its way into my life, and how profound it is as a ‘thing’ to do. Some days I meditated for hours, other days mere minutes, but I have kept myself consistent in doing it.

I started in January 2019, and I can confidently say I completely embodied change as a ‘person’. The ebbs and fluctuations of my thoughts and feelings I constantly observed whilst meditating made me aware of these subtle changes I tended to ignore in every day life. Whether it be feelings or thoughts or perspectives, I began to really feel ‘myself’ as a malleable thing, not a concrete entity carried over from day to day. It changed my perspectives on everything. Food, drug use, personal opinions, dispositions, love, hate, academic work, materialism, literally everything. I found myself becoming way more honest in conversation and being with others. Before I found myself overthinking how to ‘be’, like I needed to rummage through a guide for my ‘self’ for certain situations. I now feel I can put in real effort in just ‘being’. In ceasing the effort to be ‘myself’, I seem to be more ‘myself’ than I ever have been in my life. I am not transcendent whatsoever, but time now feels like water flowing through a river which I try to swim with, not against. 

I turned from atheism to Buddhism and now simply have a much more profound respect for life. I feel myself less at odds with what is around me, and instead embraced by it. Even if what is around me is so different to me, as I would not be a certain way if other things were not a different way. I kicked awful habits, yet judged others less as I judged myself less. I can finally say I am ‘happy’, and I try my best to be aware of what I am attached to, and what sufferings I am lead towards.

I encourage everyone to meditate now because of how much it ‘changed’ me. Though, in retrospect, it feels like nothing changed in a way. It simply feels like I started existing instead of trying to exist. I truly believe this extremely simple action is what makes us all feel ‘better’, yet we will possibly all realize there is no better or worse, there is just all."

I know there’s many benefits and wisdom gained from meditation, but I have an interest maybe some of you have too. To be able to astral project/ OBE experience, any of you reached this stage? If so can you describe as best the “stages” from your experience before reaching this high level?
I know it’s normal to hear that high pitch sound (consciousness?) I hear it almost every day, but is it more common among conscious/spiritual people? 

This was the end, lastly i’m sharing a nightmare I had yesterday so read if interested. I’m a college student.

So I went to a new school, not sure if I failed or graduated the school before. However this school was different, there was a ranking system of abuse, teachers and top students could do whatever to others. Students weren’t allowed on the phone, only 15 minutes a day with supervision. When I wanted to go home, they made it very clear I couldn’t but I still tried. I got caught outside school, got beaten and brought back. So it was 9pm bedtime for all, still no phone allowed. I almost fell asleep but I noticed something happening. Two teachers were trying to enter my mind or something, her hand was on my front head and doing some movements I could feel it’s effects. They were surprised since it failed. The next day, everyone got work and if your not sufficient enough you’d get beaten. Eventually at the end of class, I saw a black cat (it looked like the one I have irl) I picked it up and walked outside. Weird how none noticed me, when I got out of the gates. Then they noticed me and I had to bolt. First a weird long human came after me and I managed to get rid of that one (not sure how). Second came a army of tactical teams, I felt the dream adrenaline. I felt hopeless and the only chance I had to escape was by taking them out. Using their own weapons and body’s as shields, they all got taken out. Lastly, a strange like horizontal portal appeared and clones of strange non-human evil clowns started popping out and started chanting some shit. Not sure what I did, but I finally escaped and woke up."

DestructorEFX	2021-04-07 19:20:44+00:00	Does meditation increase flow state?	"This last weekend me and two friends went biking on a trail track deep in the woods. It's kilometers of a very exciting and beautiful experience.

At one moment I felt effortless, my body reacted precisely to the curves, ups and downs, adjusting the center of gravity of my body and the angle of the bike, how much should I turn the bike, knowing how fast or when to break to keep up with my friends, all of this automatically. The cold wind hitting my face, I felt completely free.

For me, I can say that meditation helped me reach this flow state. Do meditation and flow states have any correlation?"

As you think, so shall you become. Like many of us, I thought that life should change from outside. I thought that I should bend the external situations and circumstances of my life to comply to my desires.

In reality, we have little to no control over outside circumstances. Once you understand this, it is liberating. We do have some form of control in the world within and that is huge.

When you change the world within, the world without will change. You might think it is a contradiction but it is not. Neville Goddard used to say that we are the Gods of our own realities. Through our imagination and awareness, we shape our world.

I know and teach visualisation, affirmations, scripting and many other tools to get one’s yearnings. I favor mental diets, meditation and scripting over all techniques."

I felt my body become heavy, ive never felt such a heavy presence on my body ever. I lost all sense of time and sat thoughtless it was very peaceful. After a while I decided to stop and get up. It seemed like I was in that state for like 5 minutes but when I opened up my eyes and picked up my phone 2 and a half hours had gone by. 

I tried today and could not get into the same trance like state. Perhaps it was beginners luck. 

It was the most calming experience I've ever had. I really felt like I was one with everything."

Its been quite a while since I smoked, but there's a lot more to smoking addiction than the chemicals you take in. The ritual of it, the mini breaks from stressful life etc. I wonder if these deep controlled breaths are in some weird way a form of open eye meditation lol. Might be useful for cessation programs to consider some breathing exercises / relaxation techniques rather than just focusing on replacing the nicotine/ tapering off less harmful forms of nicotine ingestion. Might provide some mental/physical benefits that prevent or reduce relapses in smokers."

Any unpleasant feeling can technically be your object,

It took some time of seeing constant, scattered thoughts,

That was an unfortunate translation of the Sanskrit. ""Aum"" would have been wrong as well, but less so in a significant way.

When used correctly the Original Mantra can be best thought of as a ""password to the meditation app inside us all"".  Used correctly, it's so perfect for meditation that the description of how it works is without doubt the **simplest description of a meditation practice ever**.

In the world of philosophy there's a tenet called Ockham's Razor, which states that the shortest, most direct solution to a philosophical, mathematical or a scientific problem is the best. 

I've been writing and talking about Au-m and meditation for more than 30 years, after designing this [introduction to au-m for my 8-year-old grandson](https://agi21st.org) I've realized that this, the simplest, is best.

I don't have anxious thoughts during practice and I am able to direct my focus to a point until the sensation becomes too overwhelming. 

What I have been trying to do is focus on the sensation as a pattern of energy, but that is also part of the issue because it becomes pretty overwhelming and interferes with my ability to focus. Kind of like how you have a tickle on your neck that intensifies until you HAVE to scratch it. I was wondering if anyone had suggestions or advice for how to navigate this.

needvisuals	2021-04-07 11:23:24+00:00	Meditation as an emotional flush	"Been meditating daily for at least one year, might be 2 years by now. I used a timer and sat for 30 minutes, but very recently I stopped using a timer due to an excellent post I read on this sub. Without the timer, my focus has changed to soley feeling what is happening in my body. I spend much less time spinning around with my thoughts now, and I think that's because subconsciously I'm no longer trying to run out the clock. So interestingly enough my strategy now is to do an emotional flush on my body. I start with breathing into each chakra from root to crown. I breathe in breath and energy ""through my heart"" and exhale loving intention into the chakras. Interestingly enough it seems that each chakra has some kind of issue that will volunteer itself for me to feel and breathe through. This is a much more active meditation than before, I'm not simply focusing on the act of breathing. It's more like I'm trying to clear out the emotional clutter for the day. I was doing something similar to this before, but it's much more focused now. 

One question I would pose is this: I've heard that meditation should be simple focus on breathing in and out until the mind stops and peace is achieved - I've also heard the meditation is an opportunity to ground the energy of the body and power up the toroid field, whatever you want to call it. I do a combination of both, does anyone else do that?

Any thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated"

Ok_Cellist_2410	2021-04-07 08:49:42+00:00	Questions about tension	"If all we can be is aware, and appreciate the 'ah-a' moments, then what is this physical tension?  Where is it coming from?  What is controlling it?

I can see my goals of meditation - the intention to release tension when it arises and return to the breath when I lose track of it.  To let go.  To just be.

But this physical tension is my current default state.  I am more aware of it than ever, and it is gradually releasing.

But what is the tension?  What is the benefit of it?  Is that something that can be answered?

Or is it a continual journey of just noticing and releasing - both on and off the cushion?"

While following your breath, where do you tend to focus? Around your nose as the breath goes in and out or on the rise and fall of your chest? I know this sounds kind of silly, but lately i have been shifting between the two a lot while meditating. While it is generally easier to track your breath by focusing on your chest, I tend to get lost in thoughts without even realising. Would really appreciate your suggestions."

So far, I’ve mostly practiced in the Tibetan traditions, but am also open to aspects of other paths—but more than anything, I’d like to find an instructor who is committed to truth.  I live close to Atlanta, Georgia, which seems like a big enough city to find somebody, but I have no idea where to start. How does one begin finding a meditation teacher?  Just googling “Atlanta meditation teacher” does not feel like a reliable way to go for a number of reasons.  Any help is incredibly appreciated."

"I had a tough conversation today that I had no way to prepare for and also had no advance notice it was coming. Instead of reacting with overworked emotions like I normally do, I used mindfulness that I learned during meditation to help me navigate it. Overall what I learned helped me get all of my feelings out without getting overly defensive. It's the first time meditation practice had a positive impact on everyday events."
Javyev	2021-04-07 03:47:14+00:00	Can you give yourself permission to forget?	"When I first started meditating I had this impression that it was about getting the mind to change in some way against its will. This isn't said explicitly in most meditation guides I've seen, but it is a kind of background ethos in meditation: you must surrender your will, you must let go, try to clear your mind, pay attention to this or that

But I think the real breakthrough for me was realizing meditation is a conscious choice you make. It's not a methodical practice that chips away at some barrier or a fundamental transformation of the way the mind works. When I sit down now, or even when I'm not but I want to put some meditative effort in, all I do is give myself permission to forget about protecting myself.

Stress comes from the desire to be safe. It's a tension that comes directly from vigilance. You are watching for problems and trying to protect yourself. When you make the conscious choice to *forget* about protecting anything, it feels very wrong, like you're being reckless and abandoning your responsibilities. This sense of wrongness is the only thing between your current state of mind and perfect bliss. It can even invade meditation itself, ""I have to meditate better/harder/faster/stronger in order to escape these horrible feelings I have!""

This means all of our stress is a choice we've made. We create it to remind ourselves to do this or that in order to stay safe. We are more afraid of being exposed to the world without protective walls than the horrible feelings our fears create. Removing those walls is not about force, it's about giving up on your perception of safety in exchange for perfect contentment. You can work out logically that you'll be perfectly safe forgetting all your problems for the next 30 minutes, but you'll never actually forget until you give yourself this permission. You can try as hard as you want to focus on your breathing or recite a mantra, but without this willingness to recklessly abandon your own protection, thoughts will continue to arise like the emergencies you think they are.

It's the feeling you get when you finish a horror movie and have to go down to the basement to get your frozen dinner. You know there's no one down there, but that doesn't change how you feel. You have to decide you know better than your own instincts. Once you're on the other side, you'll laugh at your own fear and wonder why you spent so much time holding on to it."

ikolpi2000	2021-04-07 02:19:35+00:00	Emptiness is an illusion	"When you can perceive something with your senses, you think it is empty. But in fact, it is always empty of a certain thing but full of others. A cup is empty of water but full of air. The black hole is empty of light but full of voidness. Nothing can be empty. 

But also, even when there is full water in the cup, the cup is also full of air (you just can't perceive it). Air can't come from anything. It is always there. It just needs the right condition. Just because it is in a cup, doesn't mean it is disconnected from everything else. Same thing with your sense of body. Similarly, you always say you are lack love, happiness, etc. But it is always there, you just can't perceive it. There is no need to seek it."

ikolpi2000	2021-04-07 01:55:29+00:00	Your mind and body is like a hotel	"In your mind, you have all kinds of visitors. You have a monk, Satan, a thief, a lawyer, a woman, a man, etc. You become whatever you think to identify yourself with. Something cannot come from nothing, it just needs the right conditions. And once you decided that you are a certain thing, you limited yourself to that role. You act out from that point of view. But your true self is the one who watches everything (in fact, there is no self). As a watcher (not really a watcher, just use it to explain logically), you become too emerge to the flow of thinking that you think it is you. For instance, when anger comes, it acts out a certain way, and you see it, you start to think you are the anger. 

As we grew up, we got more attached to the body, and we think it is our body. But it is just the makeup of the 6 elements: space, the knowing, earth( hard stuff like bones, tissues, etc), water, wind (oxygen), and fire (heat). Everything (living) is pretty much made of these things but in different amounts. The water in your body is not yours. It is no different than the water outside your body. And once it dies, you think you die. You become depressed. You might lose your memory, your knowledge, etc. But none of that is yours, you just borrow them (they are illusions anyway). Again, how can something come from nothing? We were never born and we will ever die. Most of us just start to play another role and got to emerged to it. 

Then you might ask, who you really are if you are not the body. You are the being. You have no identity. You change in every moment ( assuming time exists).  If you identify an object as a tree, in this moment, it might be make-up of these certain water elements, cells, etc. But a minute late, it is not make-up of those same particles. It creates an illusion that you think it is still the same tree. Everything changes. Your thoughts, feelings, identity are changing as well. 

Now, in terms of meditation, when anger comes, you don't resist it. Even if Satan comes, and you don't resist him, you identify yourself as someone who is good. But still, you got too emerged that you start to act from the view of a good person. You are limiting your power by doing this. If that good person got hurt, you think you got hurt, and become depressed. The right thing is to watch, without getting attached to it. Just like watching a movie, don't start to think that you the main character."

I have been doing meditation for around 72 days i have been using insight timer set on a 30min timer i cant seem to do guided courses as i cant see anything they say i should

when they say for example you are walking down a green field you feel the grass under ur feet,
i am like no i dont see or feel anything, so i gave up on guided meditaion after a month of trying.

I Decided to just do a 30min timer and see were my mind takes me but its not been easy, 

i count my breaths 1 to 10 to try help to have focus and i just let my mind wonder really and  try not to take notice of it just leave it to do as it wants.

i have found that i seem to be falling asleep at least i think i do, i am also sitting up not lying down. 

Within maybe 10 mins of starting I find my thoughts get messy and before i know it i seem to be out

i seem to come around 10 or 5 mins before the insight timer bell goes off and seem to be 100% alert as if i had a nap but have none of the drowsiness that comes from having a nap thats why i am confused i seem to be 100% alert instantly when i come out of it

Do i fall asleep or am i potentially reaching a deep meditation state which is my main goal      

 i am thinking of changing insight times to try something else, but if i am making progress here would it be wise to change it i am torn between sticking with this setup and changing to see if anything else happen as dont want to lse progress i have"

NoahBoombox	2021-04-06 22:42:02+00:00	31 consecutive days of meditation: here's what I've learnt.	"To start with, I'd like to clarify this post isn't to feed my ego or set expectations for anyone else; generally I'd like to establish some conversations, discuss tips, and thank the sub for its continued motivations.

So, meditation. I've tried in the past but never stuck to it. But since watching the Headspace show on Netflix, I figured I'll give guided another shot as it contextualises many techniques. Since then, I've been using the packs, Basics currently, to establish a routine and meditate every evening for 10 minutes.

Here's what I've learnt:

Some sessions concentration comes more naturally, other times it feels frustrating and distanced. I hope for this to improve over time.

I've picked up a voice in my head, one that narrates my mindset, or how I practise a session. It always is translating image or actions into mental subtitles.

I still ""think"" rather than ""notice. And this thinking comes hand in hand with my internal monologue.

When body scanning, my eyes physically reposition depending on where I'm scanning. My eyes are closed too.

Sometimes I fall asleep. I don't fight the sensation, I go with it. I like to think it's because my body is so relaxed that the learned reaction is to sleep.

Some days I'm more anxious than others. The anxiety of which comes from projections and predictions of the future, of which I occasionally pick up on and try to centre myself in the present. This is the key to levelling with my anxiety.

Thanks to everyone for reading, and to all the positive, personal stories I've read this past weeks. Any comments are appreciated, and I'll look forward to when my two month transition passes."
omargoldV	2021-04-06 22:40:20+00:00	Is there a specific type of meditation for reducing default mode network/intense anxiety/panic	"My biggest 'problem' in life is my nonstop rumination and self awareness. I generally just do objectless meditation since it is really the only thing I can do (cannot focus on one specific object), and a fair amount of the time my mind does quiet down. But it's also very difficult at times since it basically allows the network to go crazy and at certain points it's too intense, I just have to stop completely and go distract myself. And I don't sit down with the goal of calming my mind down or reducing activity (thus would make me panic if unable to), it's moreso that my mind is just too intense at times to meditate at all and I'm at a loss of what to do.  I'm looking for something either that is more active (if such a thing exists), or something that specifically works best to reduce default mode network activity (even if it does mean sitting with the whirlwind in my head).

I probably didn't explain perfectly so if you have questions please ask."

BOUMAIL	2021-04-06 21:22:09+00:00	Deep meditative state.	"March 12. I've marked down the date as I was writing effortlessly that note on my computer the whole time. It ended up being one the longest text I have ever written. 

A little context probably will help understand this experience a lot more. A month prior to this date, I had gone with a friend to Vancouver where we were staying with his friends. That night, we decide to all have mushrooms which a shit ton of it was stocked in one of the rooms in that apartment. It was sort of the first serious amount ingested by any of us. From there, I won't bother describing the trip as it's not the subject of this post. Personally, calling the experience highly intense would definitely be an understatement. As readers who have had mushrooms before will probably attest to this, a trip on shrooms has underlying effects, or should I precise more accurately, leads to a significant shift of perspective. The following days that prolonged into weeks up until the first week of March were very overwhelming. It peaked one day I was with friends of mine (of course by this time I had left Vancouver and went back home). This peak manifested in such a big emotional outburst ! 

This latter outburst I mentioned, to this day has left a big mark on me as I now undoubtedly consider it as the most important relief I felt in my life (I do not choose my words lightly). After this day, I quite literally have felt so much lighter. It happened on March 7. Five days later, I experience what will make the main subject of this post. The meditative state. 

Those days were swamped with profound emotions to say the least that sometimes would awaken spark moments of fear but then I would just absorb the overall benefit that I KNEW this whole period was and continues to be for me. This day, March 12, I am alone at home, I sit in my desk for hours I certainly do not even feel are passing. Probably was distracting myself with a multitude of Youtube videos mostly of discussions relaying experiences that people have gone through that I could relate to. I decide again that day for to write the rushing thoughts in mind for the God-knows which time that day. I started tirelessly transcribing all those thoughts, the initial one, just before the one that would criticize that first, just before the third that would crack up a joke, just before, just before just before ... I went on and on and couldn't stop nor did I want to. (I needed a little refresher her of what I was writing about so went on and got back to continue here) 

My ears were hissing constantly. I remember realizing that I was not peaking at my keyboard to type my words which I normally couldn't do as well as I was at that moment. I had the feeling that the typing was becoming out of my control and became robotic. All that I was writing about, were things that my mind was revealing to me and it just so happens that I was listening and transcribing it better that I have ever before. Isn't that what the definition of meditation comes down to: listening to your thoughts. I challenge here the common perspective over the state of our body when meditating (eyes shut, deeply relaxed and breathing) because I was experiencing at that moment a deep state of out of body experience having my eyes wide open ! No conditions on its definition right people ? By then, a sudden rush of wanting to pee at that moment hit. You would think that this is where a reattachment to my body would occur and yet it certainly did not happen. I was feeling very light. The bathroom is close to my room so I didn't have to travel for long to get there. I remember the feeling of the door knob when I turned it to get out of my room. I was very aware of the material I was touching (the doorknob) and felt it very vibrantly and yet subtly as if it wasn't me who was doing that. I was moving very slow the entire time. I get to the bathroom and stand up to pee and remember having noticed that I held myself exactly the same way every time I would pee and I was standing just like that at that moment of course. All of my movements felt mechanic and almost as if I wasn't the one deciding on them, my pulsions. Then comes the instant while washing my hands where I see myself in the mirror. I could see what my eyes were seeing in front of them. My vision was of course (and I had to look up how to say this just now) squinted. I wasn't aware of the word. Most of you who have had similar experiences like this before might be able to understand what I mean. We can consciously decide to jokingly squint our eyes. That's how I was seeing at that moment. I returned to my seat in my room and moments later i was gradually returning to self and remember my roommate coming in which sort of marked the end of that state i was in. And that's a wrap ! 

Stay well peeps :)"
skeleg0re	2021-04-06 21:14:10+00:00	Trouble with Posture and Focus	"Hi everyone!

I have been trying to do meditation more in a sitting up right position. I used to do it laying down and I often have problems with remaining focused. So I have two things that I want to address.

The first one being that I have neck and back problems mostly attributed to having very bad posture. This makes it difficult for me to sit normally without my whole neck and shoulders slouching forward. I try my best when meditating to sit up straight, but this causes me pain in my back and neck from the strain of sitting up straight and makes it harder to focus on meditating. Anyone have any suggestions that may help alleviate this or is there another way I should try sitting?

My second question is regarding my focus in a different way. I've been finding that it's a lot easier for me to clear my head and stay in the present moment if I keep my eyes open while meditating. But, I don't know if this technique is recommended or if I'm just stunting my own progress by doing this. I just find that it helps me stay in a grounded, present headspace if I am able to just sit in one spot with my eyes open just staring forward blankly. Any thoughts or suggestions here?"

I start laying on my bed and let my body go completely limp. I say to myself let go of the past, let go of the future and let go of this moment. I go through this mental shift with each one of those statements. And I sort of just am existing in that moment. Then I just keep trying to release more and more control. Then I have figured out a way to sort of... release my body. I don’t know how to explain it. But I feel waves of pleasure that are accompanied by my body shaking/vibrating slightly. It’s definitely something I am doing because I can keep making it happen. But the pleasure and the experience is pretty intense it’s nothing I’ve ever experienced before with mediation. So much so that I’ll sit up after vibrating and have to stop and audibly ask “what was that!?”

I have been meditating on and off for a cple yrs now, but only recently have been really taking it seriously. I just did simple chakra cleanses, not understanding it really. So for the past six months, I have been studying and practicing mindfulness meditation and hypnosis, as well as dabbling in astral projection and prana breath work. It is a life saver. It feels like these practices are slowly re wiring my brain. I am triggered less. I get angry less. I am not as sad. My anxiety is not as severe (barely experience heart pulpitations anymore). Also, I have always had vivid dreams, but now they are on the verge of being lucid. My concentration has improved. Im getting back to me. 

I would love to hear your experiences with mindfulness, meditation, astral projection, yoga, prayer and anything spiritual that has helped you along your lifes journey :)

Oh and I cant stress enough the importance of nutrition! It helps :P"
StitchingHooker	2021-04-06 14:15:54+00:00	Bilingual meditation	"To start of I am bilingual but use English 98% of the time. Both professionally and in my personal life through conversations and the media I consume. I noticed my inner thoughts tend to be in English which makes sense due to how much I use it. Also during work outs, counting my reps etc tends to be in English. However I just realized when I meditate I automatically count my breaths in my mother tongue. This seems odd since my guided meditation is in English as are my inner thoughts.

Do any other bilingual meditators experience this?"

TheRappingYogi	2021-04-06 13:13:41+00:00	The MOST IMPORTANT meditation technique is.....	"**No technique! : )** What I've found is that it doesn't really matter what one you practise. The most important thing is *your heart and what you do with it*. 

I've found that the more I just SURRENDER all my mental and emotional attachments, cares and concerns (to my version of God) the **deeper and deeper** I go. 

It literally is not about clever techniques but actually just releasing your interest the world for a few mins. 

Even my breathing comes under control. Maybe on another post I'll talk about what I've actually felt.. but yea, the most important technique is SURRENDERING....

I guess that ALSO means if you cannot let go then techniques can only help you to a certain degree."

DandelionPG	2021-04-06 11:56:59+00:00	About Prerequisites To start a non-Ego type of meditation	"The development of consciousness is a complex and spontaneous process that takes place through the daily practice of some type of non-Ego meditation. Starting to practice this type of meditation requires a number of prerequisites, the most important of which are a highly developed level of consciousness achieved during all previous incarnations, especially at the mental level, positivity, empathy, intellectual curiosity, formal or informal education, lack of desire to control and manipulate people in relationship or during social contacts, detachment from material values, money and positions of power in society ... and the like.

Of course, these are, say, ideal prerequisites for engaging in some type of non-Ego meditation, but that doesn’t stop others from trying the effects of the non-Ego type of meditation as well.

The preparation process itself requires attending spiritual seminars during which the meditation instructor makes requests to the spiritual consciousness to heal all meditation participants, gives them instructions on the basics of self-healing technique with hands and chakras, strengthens the energy part of their nervous system ... and the like.

Only after that, to those who have shown success, is the text of the petition to be sent to their Soul communicated. If this goes well, then their Souls respond with a healing effect in the form of drops of golden rain that descend on their auras, penetrate them and begin the healing process. 

This begins the process of healing, later and the development of the meditator's consciousness."

blackplotinus	2021-04-06 11:12:50+00:00	"Philosophical Meditation, Henosis, and The Original And Best Mantra"	"The philosopher Plotinus is credited with founding what is arguably the most influential school of philosophy in history, Neoplatonism. He was well known for his ideas concerning ""awareness"", and more specifically - not ""unawareness"" but ""nonawareness"", which the philosophers referred to as ""henosis"".

If you google the word ""henosis"" you'll probably read that it means something like ""union with what is most fundamental in reality"". That sounds vaguely glorious and perhaps like some kind of enlightenment. 

However, when asked by his biographer how one might achieve henosis, Plotinus simply said, ""Take away everything"". 

According to his biographer, student and constant companion Porphyry, Plotinus only claimed to have achieved a state of henosis four times in his whole life. Plotinus wanted to go to India to study their philosophies and religions but major regime change in Persia meant that that as far as he made in his journey before he had to turn back.

Had he made it he may have discovered the Original Mantra and untangled how to use it. 

I've created a very brief, 3-Step untanglement exercise for my eight-year-old grandson.

"I and my friend were discussing what should be the attributes of a good meditation app. We hit multiple chords in our discussion and finally concluded that a good app is one that makes you stick to the practice and makes you self-reliant to do the session independently without the app in few months (time might vary on the receptivity of the user).

If one starts resembling the app itself then you are not going on a path of meditation but being gamified in some way.

What do guys say?"

However, I've also become a lot more sensitive to agitation (or maybe I'm just more awareness of it???) when it comes to aimless browsing through YouTube, Twitch, watching TV, or even just listening to music. There's something disruptive and agitating about them, which makes me want to seek out a further sense of peace away from these sorts of sensory inputs. Perhaps my physiology has updated, perhaps they stress me out more now, perhaps I feel increased guilt on ""wasting"" time on these things, perhaps I'm just more aware or something that was already there, I'm not sure...

Is this relatable for anyone, and if so, what sort of insights/conclusions did you draw from this, and what did you do about it?"

I do a sitting meditation in silence during which I try to focus on nothing and open up my mind. I already had great experiences, even one where I felt my mind lifting from my body (its difficult do describe ;) ).

Now I have two questiones:

1. Am I doing it wrong if my back is not completly straigt? I get better relaxation and better ""results"" if I dont focus too much on sitting perfectly upright...

2. I noticed while meditating that the left side of body is not as relaxed as the right side because I have a cramped muscle on the left side of my shoulder. That results in my whole left side being more tense. That sometimes during meditation makes me feel like my body is tilted to the right, sometimes by as much as +45° and that can be very irritating. Has anyone of you ever had that same sensation and how did you get rid of it?

Thanks for all answers already."

deineMuddaJunge	2021-04-05 23:11:26+00:00	What do you think about the Healthy Minds Program App	"Hi all,

I just discovered the Healthy Minds Program app. 

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.healthyminds&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.healthyminds&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=US)

It was mentioned in a german Podcast and I think it's just awesome.

I used for a long time Headspace and I liked for the beginning, but after a year or so I felt like that the things were repeating and I missed some deeper explaining content.

After that I used the Waking Up App. I like it is the more deeper covering of the subjects, but I have problems with the guided meditations. As a none native speaker it's not so easy for me to follow along with instructions. They are also too fast and little bit mumbled. I am also a little bit lost with the different tracks and I feel like should I try now the meta way or the stoic path? A little bit guidance would be nice.

&amp;#x200B;

Now with the Healthy Minds Program so fare, what I really like is the clear voices, but also the good combination of theory and meditations.

One is more guided and does not have to combine theory and meditation themself like in the Waking Up App.

Also the stuff is delivered in the right speed for me. What is stretched over 3 weeks in Headspace, like with the relationship meditations, is just handled in one sitting here.

What is also cool that you can do every meditation passive and active.

What do you guys think about the app?"

It’s not the unsettling chill of anxiety, more of a rush of energy? It’s hard for me to explain but I was just wondering if anyone else experiences this and if it means anything? Thanks for reading!

"Hear me out, this really isn’t well put together but for a generalization before you decide not to read it all. I’ve been meditating to the 369 hz frequencies tones or whatever. And the next day I wake up feeling actually like mentally depressed like an unbalance in my brain. These could totally not be correlated at all but I also think maybe it could be and this is my frequency and vibration going out of wack before pulling itself together and I also think it could correlate to the stages of spiritual awakening but idk enough about it. I think like maybe it could be how those crystal girls experience Moldavite and it is doing something similar maybe? I hope I don’t sound crazy I don’t really know how this Reddit is usually I just joined it and I also just started to get into these things. I know it’s really long I wish I was better at making these posts. -Basically started listening and meditating to certain frequencies, got depressed stopped for a few days, did it again felt depressed. Before doing these things my purpose for them is that I really felt like I lost myself and was disconnected w myself and my emotions and the universe. I learned to handle my stress and emotions to the point where I barely felt stressed or many emotions. I wanted to regain those connections and feel stressed so I can care about things again and reconnect w the universe and myself.- ok im not gonna make this any longer, if you have any guidance, similar experiences, tips on next stages and management, or just think I’m crazy and trying to find correlations, lmk!

So i just started meditating to some YouTube videos that play sounds and music to certain frequencies that are suppose to have abilities to affect your frequency and vibration and what not. This was brought to my attention after becoming slightly fixated in Nikola Tesla (adhd procrastinating) and I learned about his 369 obsession and thing w frequencies relating to 369 or something. I’ve noticed there’s been a correlation of depression in me since I have started. I wanted to see if anyone has experienced the same or if there really is no correlation here and it’s other factors making me depressed. Also when I say depressed I really do mean like neurologically I feel actually depressed liek I just woke up one day in an intense depressive state my brain was just sad and my entire body and being was just sad and I couldn’t explain why. It felt like just a unbalance in my brain.

Ok I wrote how my experience of it this past week to see if someone has experienced something similar but I also have been researching Like “spiritual awakening stages” which I know sounds corny but it does also could possibly align w that stuff. But I feel like it wouldn’t happen in the course of a few days. I thought maybe someone could share their thoughts. 
I’ve only done it a hand full of times in the last week. I listen to particular frequencies after researching their each of their meanings. And the first time it was only for like 20 minutes max and it was just difficult for me to keep meditating w out getting distracted. And I tried again the next day and was able to for a little longer w some bumps in between then I tried to do more of it that night and fell asleep w the music on throughout the whole night like it was still playing when I woke up. I also did the 369 manifestation method as well (I figured I should go all in even if it doesn’t end up working) And the next day I was insanely insanely sad. It felt like one of the worst mornings ever. I have experienced episodes liek that a few times but honestly jsut around my period or on birth control or something so it’s not the most out of the ordinary thing for me to experience but it wasn’t that this time and I have really only had episodes liek that maybe 3 times throughout my whole life. This was on Friday and on Saturday I kinda gave it a break I was feeling a little bit better but it felt more like a sad hangover not that I was sad sad and on Sunday (yesterday) I wasn’t really sad anymore but i did sleep like all day. I gave it another try last night and I ended up meditating for over an hour and a half w very minimal interruptions and distractions. I also not to be corny I did have like a spiritual talk w myself and tried to connect in that way. I woke up today still a little sad afterwards. Not nearly as sad as Friday but considerably unnormally sad and to wear it again felt like my brain was unbalanced I really am jot sad about anything in particular and I have asset and ruled most outside factors out. 

I also am really not usually a sad person I have learned to manage and stabilize my stress and emotions very well. But I have been talking to this guy and I was telling him I learned to manage and stabilize my emotions so well that it is now a negative feature of me. Like I won’t even care or be disappointed if I fail at something. I have also been struggling w my adhd this year and have been trying to get a grip on it for so long. But I felt like not feeling those emotions was a factor keeping me back. And I was telling him how I wish I could feel them again and reconnect w those emotions. I just felt like I really lost sight of myself or really jsut lost myself entirely and I felt disconnected w my emotions and myself and the universe. I also use to have this kinda power w the universe and I KNOW ima sound crazy but the people in my life validated it and saw the crazy synchronicities that happened way too often. So anytime I would verbally complain or cry usually out of frustration about something the universe would INSTANTLY respond. This would resonate most or at least in the most validating way when I would lose things I would search everywhere and wouldn’t find them then as soon as I would complain or cry (yes I lost things to that point I have adhd leave me alone) they would appear in a spot I knew I had checked and within the same minute. This happened in other factors of my life too. But then I moved to college and just learned to handle my stress to the point where I wouldn’t react that way and now I don’t react at all, and I feel like I have lost touch with myself and the universe in that way and I have lost that synchronicity and I miss it. I started doing these things to try and reconnect w my emotions in that way and the universe and really just regain that connection and synchronicity. So that’s why I also think they could be connected and this is a blockage I have to go through before. -in my opinion, the universe did not have to do it that intensely, I personally would have picked a different method but to each their own."

ikolpi2000	2021-04-05 19:49:24+00:00	The logical mind is stupid and evil	"As we grow up, we reprogram ourselves with a bunch of useless concepts. When we are learning new materials, we tend to bring old concepts to judge and compare them to what we knew. This is why adults learn new things much slower than babies. 

We learned about history that certain groups were racist to others. But now, even when we have nothing to do with a person, we still hate them because of what we have learned. Same thing with the news, etc

Languages are meaningless but why would we give them so much power. When someone calls you stupid or threaten you, why would you react in a certain way? It is no more than a sound. We programmed ourselves too much that we are willing to kill/hurt others over language.

We should see things as they are. Once we speak or conclude (filtered through the logical mind), it is wrong. For instance, we call this flower sunflower, but in fact, it is much different from other sunflowers. We then formed an illusion of sunflower in our minds. But truly, there is no sunflower. It is what it is. Similarly, we name everything that we see differently. This is why we are limited. When someone talks about a sunflower, we formed an illusion in our mind because of past experiences.

A logical mind makes us greedy. We are so calculated that we would kill more animals for food than we needed. We would fight over lands even when the lands don't belong to anybody. 

We created an illusion of self. This is my body, and if you hurt it, I will kill you. But in fact, it is made up of animal meat, water, minerals, etc. Nothing is yours. The air (oxygen) inside you is no different than the air outside of you. Why do you think it is yours?

We so stress over the amount of time that we have with this body because we learned that we will die at some point and everything will be gone. We were taught to cry when someone we loved passes away and that they will be in heaven.  But what dies is our logical mind. We are more than just the logical mind. We were never born and we never die. What dies is this illusion of the body created by our logical mind. 

The logical mind is very limited. It can't escape the idea of duality. For it, things must be either good or bad or a certain way. But truly, things simply be ..."

"So recently with more meditation and mindfulness practice, I find that I feel a sense of boredom or overall feeling of boredom any time I'm trying to be in the present moment.  It's like I attach thinking or daydreaming with being more fun or even being more productive. 

Has anyone gone through this ? What can I do to actually enjoy being present ? For example if I'm washing the dishes and I remain present while doing so , how do I avoid the feeling of boredom during it ?"

"Sam Harris’ waking up app is the method of learning to meditate that has resonated with me the most by far. The way he speaks about it really eliminates a lot of the mysticism that is often attributed to it and makes it feel really practical and grounded. I recommend this app to anyone who wants to meditate but has struggles to see any benefits, or understand what to do or why we do it.

Furthermore, this app is free. But it seemed to me at first that all the great content requires a premium subscription which costs a lot of money. Until I discovered that a free premium membership is offered no questions asked! 

You can get the premium content here for free: 

https://app.wakingup.com/request-free-account

This is a game changer. It’s not paid promotion or anything like that, I’m just getting on pretty well with the app and I think it could help some people out. 

Good luck to everyone.."
ikolpi2000	2021-04-05 19:01:06+00:00	Flow state is the result of meditation	"Do you know that great scientists like Albert Einstein, Nikola Telsa, etc rediscover their great inventions in the flow state?

Flow state is when you let go of your ego-mind and logical mind. You just simply flow with your thoughts without judging them. It is the flow of the universe. In this state, you don't care about if you die or not, you don't care about if the world is going to disappear the next day. You are fearless at this moment. You are freed from your past and future. You are in the now. 

Example: 1) you have been thinking hard about how to solve a problem. But then you decided to take a shower ( you give up the trying), then the answer pop-up in your head. 

2) you trying so hard on your test to solve a complete problem, but then realized the answer after taking the test.

3) Athletics perform their best when they don't care much about losing and winning. 

4) many great ideas came up when you are calm

5) artists develop great songs when they are in nature (careless about the world)

The logical mind is dumb and limited. It can't function without space and time. It has to identify everything as good or bad. It comes up with a name for everything. It is a ""tool"" that trying to take over us. If you can't stop thinking logically, it took over you. Since it is a tool, we should be able to use it and turn it off when not needed. We do this by meditating, sleep, taking drugs, drinking coffee, take a cold shower, sex, etc 

How to get into a flow state?

Be faithful with what you are doing. Watch every motion, emotion, thought at its fullness (without try to resist). Give it your best.

Example: when washing dish, you watch how you moved your hand. You watch the sensation when water touch your skin. Do not direct your attention to a certain object. Be as a mirror. Reflects whatever comes up. 

You should not care about the results, the consequences, (free from the future). Don't care if you will die or not. Don't be calculated. 

You should not think about what happened a couple of minutes, hours, etc ago ( free from the past)

You should not think of other things ( not attached to the now)"

I’ve been meditating for 20-30 minutes daily for the past 3 weeks, and am starting to see some changes to every day life. I focused on being present during Easter church, and it was the most powerful mass I’ve been to. I’ve also been more relaxed when socializing, and am beginning to take in more from lectures.

On the flip side, meditation has made me painfully aware of social anxiety, slightly depressed, and resurfaced memories of things from my past that I regret. I’m concerned that continuing down this path could have a net negative impact... Are negative feelings from meditation normal? Is this something I should be worried about? And should I pause the practice?

Note: I’m a graduate student, working 14-16 hour days on weekdays so this is a stressful time - I initially started pursuing meditation to be more relaxed, go with the flow, and help with ego."

Is this something I should work toward removing from my practice?"	"Hello everyone, I hope you are all well. I am not new to meditating, but I haven't ever felt like I was doing it ""right"". My internal monologue is always counting my breath or acknowledging it and I cannot seem to control it. I know the goal is observation rather than silencing the brain, but I can't help but to count or to assign word to my in and out breaths. I feel that it may be hindering my practice. Common techniques I use include:

* Counting breath up to ten and then resetting at one (one-inhale, two-exhale, etc.)
* Saying in my mind (fairly unintentionally) Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, and so on
* 4-7-8 breathing while my internal monologue counts along
* square breathing while my internal monologue counts (1234-1234-1234-1234)"

Back when I discovered Wim Hof and his breathing exercise, somehow I understood the method in a wrong way. Instead of emptying my lungs after 30-45 breathing in and out, I did the opposite and took a deep breath and held it as long as I could and it actually felt great.

I've been doing it like this for a long time and recently I realized that I was supposed to empty my lungs before holding my breath. Even though I've been doing wrong, I can hold my breath for almost 5-6 minutes and I feel like I'm achieving a state of mind that resembles calmness and something close to a psychedelic experience.

Do you think doing this distracts me from actually focusing on the meditation or did I find a method that actually works for me? Or, will holding my breath for a long time harm me in any way?"

StarRoadExits	2021-04-05 15:32:58+00:00	A Guide to Meditation	" **Introduction**

Meditation  is the act of focusing our  attention in a specific way and holding it  as a mental exercise. This is  considered a mild alteration in  consciousness. Meditation has been used  in various forms throughout  history; sustaining focus on an intention  in mystical practices can be  considered a form of meditation, for  instance.

Meditation  has been the subject of significant  scientific investigation, which  has validated it as a psychological  construct and with tangible  applications and benefits. Engaging in a  regular meditation practice  can lead to measurable benefits, like a  reduction in anxiety, a  strengthening of one’s attention capacity,

**Single-point Meditation**

Single-point   meditation is one of the simplest forms of meditation. In single-point   meditation, you focus your attention on one single point to the   exclusion of all other thoughts and sensory perceptions. The subject you   choose can be whatever you want. It’s easy to pick out something that   catches your eye in your immediate environment and focus on that. You   could focus on a yellow floor tile that catches your eye, or feel the   texture of the blanket on your couch. You could focus on something you   visualized inside of your head.

Many  people enjoy focusing on a  repetitive physical sensation like  breathing. They feel air flow into  their lungs, and then feel the air  leave as they exhale. Anytime they  feel a distracting thought, they  focus their attention on their  breathing and let go of their thoughts.  Some people close their eyes and  imagine their breath as colored whisps  of smoke, glowing blue as they  inhale and then red as they exhale,  flowing in and out.

Pick a   comfortable position; some people like sitting or laying down, others   like to stand. Set aside twenty minutes of time where you won’t be   disturbed, and plan to repeat this exercise several times a week. The   key to experiencing the full range of benefits from meditation is to   practice regularly; multiple times a week is preferred.

Begin   by focusing on your chosen subject. Focus on your subject and allow   your thoughts to slip away. Allow your worries and present concerns to   slip away, turning your thoughts back to your chosen subject each time   something distracts you. It is okay to lose your focus and be   distracted; this will happen many times, and it never really goes away.   Anchor your entire existence around perceiving your subject; if your   subject is breathing, allow your focus on that action to fill your   entire perception of reality. Eventually, you should enter a calm state   of mind where you are completely centered in the present, focused on   your chosen subject.

**Mindfulness**

In  mindfulness meditation, we focus on  thought itself. Whenever a thought  arises, we disengage from it and  return to focusing on our thoughts.  In many respects, we are focused on  the act of disengagement from  thought.

Engaging in  mindfulness  is incredibly simple. Pick a comfortable position and set  aside twenty  minutes of time where you won’t be disturbed. Consider  using a timer so  that you aren’t preoccupied with keeping track of the  time.

Focus.  You do not need to close your eyes. Rather,  allow yourself to focus  without a subject. What is demanding your  attention? Sensory details,  thoughts. Accept and disengage from each  thought and environmental  circumstance. Accept all thoughts and feelings  without judgment, and  let go of them without further engagement. Over  time, your thoughts  will begin to quiet, leaving you with a temporarily  quiet mind free  from anxiety that is completely anchored in the present.

Practicing   mindfulness can lead to the development of a mindful mindset. In other   words, the state of mindful acceptance provoked by mindfulness   meditation becomes chronic. This helps aid an individual in managing   mental health symptoms. People become used to letting go of thoughts and   feelings, even difficult ones. The practice of nonjudgmental  acceptance  allows people to accept their thoughts more easily.

**Mantra Meditation**

Mantra  meditations are very popular.  Transcendental meditation is a form of  mantra meditation. Many different  types of mantras except, conceptually  speaking. A mantra is a  repetitive phrase, action, or idea that we  focus on to the exclusion of  all other thought. Because of the  repetitive and cognitively exhausting  nature of the mantra, it  overwhelms our psychological defenses in a  distinct way.

Choosing  a mantra is simple. It can be anything  from a word that means  something to you to a nonsense string of letters  and numbers. Pick your  mantra, and begin meditating. Focus on the  action of repeating your  mantra under your breath to yourself. If  necessary, you can repeat it  in your mind (as opposed to out loud) for a  similar effect. Focus on  repeating your mantra for the duration of your  meditation session. The  repetition of your mantra should be the sole  focus of your meditation  session, all other thoughts should be ignored  and drowned out with your  mantra. Your mantra will very quickly drown  out your thoughts, leaving  you with a calm mind.

**Open Monitoring**

Open  monitoring is a very useful form of  meditation. In open monitoring, we  watch our thoughts without judgment.  We let our thoughts play out  without intervention. Clearing our mind is  not the goal of this form of  meditation.

Begin meditating.   Look at your thoughts, your imagination, your mind’s eye. Immerse   yourself in this mental place, focusing solely on your thoughts. Do not   engage with or judge your thoughts. Allow them to exist without   interacting with them. Be an observer to your own thought processes. If   you find yourself judging, engaging with, or otherwise interacting with   your thoughts - step back and let go, then re-focus your attention on   your thoughts.

Open monitoring is  very useful for detecting  the origin of trains of thought. If you  watch your thoughts when  something triggers an anxiety or PTSD  response, you can see the train of  associations back to the original  memory (or something related to the  original memory) there. You can see  more mundane connections between  everyday ideas when you monitor your  thoughts. The way the mind is  associatively connected is revealed to  the person who learns to  chronically watch their thoughts."

The Original Mantra \[au-m\] was **perfect** for that because it's really a physical key/password to the veritable meditation app inside us \[all, fascists too even\]. Unfortunately, OM was wrong in two ways, which left the gate open for the millions of mantras milling about, waiting to be mouthed.

The gist of it being we all experience pain, be it physical or mental or spiritual, which was referred to as the first arrow, and illustrated as experiencing being pierced by an arrow. Ouch, right? The conversation then went on to explain that suffering is the second arrow, and while we can’t control the first arrow, we can choose to suffer or not suffer. 

I am curious to know how you work through or deal with your own suffering? Furthermore, how does this show up in your meditation? Are there any mantras or affirmations that are helpful for learning how to accept mental/spiritual/emotional pain but not suffer because of it?"

I am aware of baseless, destructive thinking so much quicker and I can halt that and become mindful again, almost chuckling at where my mind goes.

Last night I read something about runners high equivalent to meditating. In the sense, meditating for around 45 minutes gives pleasurable results on the body, almost like a rush of bliss and electricity. So I decided to do a 30 minute meditation and around 3 minutes before the end I felt a huge blissful buzz. So I have decided to now commit to 30 minutes in the morning before I start my day and then 30 minutes in the evening before I sleep.

Now I understand it’s the true definition of just “being.” It’s when you’re able to bring your mind to a state of complete serenity. No thoughts, no worries, anticipations, etc. a good analogy is if you think of your thoughts like clouds. On a normal day, it’s sunny outside and you’ll see clouds of different shapes / sizes passing along all throughout the day. Some days it’s a hurricane, some days there are a lot of clouds. Meditation is when its a completely blue sky, sunny day without any clouds passing along.

          I have heard that there is a way to cut out sound and noises without using headphones, but rather by meditating. How is this achieved?

Long question:
          My mother is a former primary school teacher and a very religious person at that. She taught English in Japan in the early 90s and had to go through studying methods to calm students down by making them meditate. As a Christian, she does not have a high opinion of meditation and believes that it is a form of evil, however, one time she decided to try out a meditation tactic that was assigned to her. The meditation was supposed to eliminate sound from her surroundings by focusing on them intently (that's all the details I have). She tried this out in a crowded and noisy environment on a Japanese train on the way to work, and to her amazement, it worked. She eliminated all sound from her surroundings and was left in complete peace. At this moment, she heard a deep male voice saying ""it's quiet here isn't it?"" This both shocked her and creeped her out at the same time, and she decided never to do it again due to its close connection to the devil.

This is the story that she told me, she wasn't the type of person to lie to her children so I'm guessing she actually heard the voice. It's been year's since she told me this, and she refused to tell me anything more about it (she thought she sensed that I was interested or something I guess).

Has anyone heard of this meditation style? Does anyone know the steps you take to get to this state?"

I started meditating about 4 months ago, and have been using the app ""waking up"" by Sam Harris.
The first 2 months was great and helped me be alot more mindful through my days. But the last 2 months ive encountered a problem.

It started out as a fear that maybe im not meditating the right way, i started overthinking the practice and became a little obsessive about it. Now i find myself constantly thinking about my experience and analyzing everything during practice, sometimes during the rest of my day also. This has made me alot more distracted and somewhat cut off from the people around me, because i find myself lost i thought  most of the day.
Im much more distracted now than i was when i started, kinda the opposite of being mindful.

Im thinking alot about how things ""should"" be during meditation. For example: When i notice that a thought is present i try to let it be and watch it until it passes, when it does, i think ""it passed"" and i watch that thought and it goes on looping. I get lost in thought after every new sensation i notice also. I have tried to ignore it, tried to accept it, observe it. But it just goes on. 
Im gonna give it a last try this week but if nothing works i feel i need tp end my practice. Its not worth it, being so lost in thought all the time has made me somewhat depressed, cut off from the people around me, and flat emotionally.

So if anyone got some tips for me i would really appreciate it, maybe someone have experienced something similar?"

eusoukartoffel	2021-04-05 08:54:30+00:00	Kundalini rising?	"I started meditating 2 years ago to supplement my psychotherapy. This past year, I started reading tarot,  casual reading about chakras and practicing candle magic.

Two weeks ago, my dreams started shifting and becoming more lucid, and I dreamt about a wolf. Last night I went into my garden, candle in water, sage burning. I sat on the ground and tried to summon the wolf to speak to it. As the wolf and I reached a clearing and I pet it, a strong gust of wind blew the candle out, I felt electricity surge through the base of my spine and burst through the top of my head. My whole body was pulsing and burning and I was overcome with emotion and memories. The wolf was telling me, ""We were always alone, remember? Remember. Remember."" I sobbed and ugly-cried for a good minute.

When I told my friend this, she said that might have been a kundalini awakening. I'm not well-versed in kundalini at all.

What was that??? Where do I go from here?
I imagine I will want to meet my wolf again, but that's all I got."
beamoflight42	2021-04-05 08:44:32+00:00	I finally understand why it's important not to stop practicing	"So it finally happened, after a bit over a year and a half(?) of meditating daily. Though I would argue the time it takes isn't important. 

In the midst of a semi-panic attack, it finally clicked. 

This time instead of resisting, I simply accepted the fact, like I had many other panic attacks, that I was going to (what felt like) die. But this time instead of worrying I started only focusing on each breath, deep conscious breaths. 

I put on a (what felt like) random Metta meditation by Sam Harris, can't hurt to practice some love if this is my final moments was probably along what I was thinking. 

But this time something completely different happened, instead of the panic attack gradually disappearing, something just snapped and I got this overwhelming sense of love, understanding and that everything was okay. 

I can't really explain it, and it probably does sound quite strange but I know that many others have probably gone through what I did (as I've definitely seen on previous posts here) and I just wanted to share this happiness. 

If anybody can give some simple advice on how to proceed forward apart from just continuing meditating that would be highly appreciated. Maybe some advice on interesting topics to look into related to mindfulness (buddhism, hinduism etc, anything really I love learning about everything and anything)

Right now I'm just focusing on taking each day and moment as it happens, there's of course still a lot of unsolved challenges in my life but the main thing that's changed now I would say is I never lose hope in the same way I did before, and so far I don't feel bad (sad, anxious, worried) in the same way as before, and just trying slowly to meditate a little more over time than I have been (initially when I started it was 10 min, then 20 min each day but then I lost priority a little and it went back to 10 minutes), though I think what is important isn't how long you formally practice but that you really do try to practice being mindful in each moment of daily life too (which is really difficult but I'm quickly seeing progress)"

I'm a complete novice to meditation but I've been familiar with it my whole life, my mom used to take me to her meditation seminars and they usually had like a parallel kids seminar, where they would teach us a few things, but I was never too interested until now that I'm an adult.

I've always felt a tingly sensation in between my  eyebrows, a lil up towards my forehead, whenever I pray, concentrate on something or try to meditate, it has always happened to me as far as I remember, so I was wondering if someone could tell me what it means. The only thing similar that I found online is the third eye but like I said before, I'm not training meditation, so I think that's such an advanced concept should not apply to me.

I also have a lot of trouble emptying my mind so any tips would also be appreciated."

Jax_Gatsby	2021-04-05 04:35:12+00:00	"Except for silence, everything else is your imagination."	"I'm sure some of us have experienced a deep silence and stillness while meditating. That silence is the only reality, everything else that comes up (thoughts, imagination, hallucinations, visons and so on) these are of the mind and therefore they are not real, regardless of how beautiful they may be. The psychological mind isn't to be trusted because it is deceptive, it builds you up just to knock you back down, that's the nature of the egoic mind. Only silence can be trusted because it is not an illusion or a dream, and everything else is born out of it.

In silence we are one with existence, but when thought comes up and we identify with it we fall back into the illusion of separation."

Sometimes only once, but mostly at least two times a day. It's absolutely incredible that it has had so much of an effect on me. I have less anxiety and stress and because of that, because of lack of neurotic thinking, I have had more energy to take on each day with a different perspective and a better out look. I still get mad, still get sad, frustrated, and lonely, but these emotions don't stay with me throughout the day. They don't drag me down and leave me feeling worse anymore. This whole thing is rather peaceful and this community is great, and I'm grateful to be learning new ways of acceptance."

PrettaaayPrettyGood	2021-04-05 02:40:33+00:00	First time meditation retreat suggestions	"Hi all, I am looking for some suggestions on weeklong meditation retreats for beginners. I am graduating from college in May, and post-graduation feels like the ideal time to do my first meditation retreat before nursing school.

I’ve only been meditating for several months now, but I’ll provide you with a bit of background. My meditation journey began once I finally convinced myself to start using the guided meditation app, “Waking Up” by Sam Harris. I have been a huge fan of Sam Harris for over a year now, and his app has shown me how life-changing the practice of meditation is. I know that he has been on multiple silent retreats, including one in China that lasted an entire year, which is inspiring to say the least.

I am looking for a weeklong retreat—preferably in California, but I’m also open to other options. I’m fully vaccinated, so I’m hoping all of these retreats aren’t still shut down due to COVID. 

Do you think a Vipassana/silent retreat might be a little too intense for my level of experience? If so, what other suggestions do you have for a first-timer? Any advice is much appreciated!"

Our jobs,the money we make, our hobbies, things we're good at. We all do these things to the best of our ability to be good, or at least I do. Where is the line that defines being humble and being too egotistical? How does one progress their life in profession and salary without losing yourself in your ego, is that possible? How can one WANT to be good at something without fueling your ego? 
*context*
I used to loathe myself, degrading myself mentally and not believing in myself. Zero confidence in anything I did. Overtime I got out of my comfort zone, gained confidence,lost weight and become more optimistic and determined. At the moment I'm on a dead set path to achieve what I want and I won't stop at nothing to get it. What should I avoid?"
Deep-Procedure-6759	2021-04-05 01:42:09+00:00	My first meditation experience	"Hello, I have been working through depression and anxiety for the last year and today I decided to try meditation. 

I closed my eyes and was just focusing on my breath. After a while I got to the stage where I was in a half asleep but awake. I kept a tab on how my body was feeling and I could not feel my hands (they were together in a praying thing but fingers intertwined if that makes sense. They felt like they were one thing and not two separate things. 

After 15ish minutes I started to feel like I was away from my body. Like It was just my head and I kept moving farther and farther back from my body. 

I also kept seeing this pictures in my head, there would be a golf ball that started swirling into a hurricane and then be gone in an instant, I would see weird shapes and green eyed babies and toddlers. I also kept seeing anime characters and unrecognizable faces. 

My eyes kept opening on their own and if I concentrated on keeping them closed I would lose that out of body experience so I taped them shut. 

After around 30 minutes of this I went to go have dinner and I felt as high as a kite. In such a blissful relaxation that I only felt after smoking an intense amount of weed. The highness slowly went away but 2 1/2 hours later I still am feeling ridiculously aware, calm, and slightly sleepy.

Let me know what you think because I am royally confused and curious. Thanks!"
BITTAH99	2021-04-05 01:15:23+00:00	Funny meditation experience	"Earlier today I went to a beach in England called Durdle Door that is surrounded by tall cliffs and huge hills everywhere. I found a nice big hill overlooking the ocean and saw a bench and decided to sit down and meditate. So I sat down and began meditating and focusing on my breath and just being present. I focused on the wind hitting my face and the sun on my skin, then brought the attention back to my breath. This continued for about 10-15 minutes before I decided to end the meditation. I opened my eyes and immediately gasped, yelled “WOAH!” and fell down to my knees and for about 5-10 seconds I had no idea what was happening. I got so deep into my meditation that I somehow forgot that I was sitting on top of a huge hill at a beach. It was probably the strangest meditation experience I’ve ever had but it was pretty funny once I calmed myself down."

ikolpi2000	2021-04-04 22:35:45+00:00	For those who is trying to seek true peace.	"True peace/happiness is not about trying to supress your emotion. Many people think that sitting down and meditate will solve all the problems, but it is not true. All it does is supressing that emotions by creating an illusion of peace. But once you lose that peace, you will return to your original state. Meditation like that is similar to doing weed or masturbating, but healthier. The way to achive ""unshakable peace or happiness"", you must let the emotion rise naturally and simply watch it (do nothing else). Once you completely sympathize (watching it without trying to supress, change, etc), you are free from it. You must watch your thought, emotion, body throughout the day (be watchful of it and do nothingelse). Watch it even when all the nasty thoughts arise (like you trying to kill someones, etc..). As long as you watch it, it does no harm to you. If you practice this well, even when someone yelled at you for no reason ( you would sympathize with them since you developed the wisdom). As a result, you will achive ultimate bliss even when you are in a big crowd. Nothing can change the peace inside you, nothing."

KundalinirRZA	2021-04-04 21:49:58+00:00	"Our physical and spiritual bodies, can hold trapped negative energy. That energy can be seen as trauma stopping us to act and feel certain ways."	"

Chakra is a Hindi word meaning 'wheel'. The ancien Indian mystics saw the chakra centres of the body whirling, wheel-like vortices of energy. There are seven as major chakras or Energy centers and many minor or lesser ones. The minor chakras include the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet.

When these energy centers are clear and aligned, the Energy flows freely up and down the spine and through out the nervous system, resulting in a feeling of peaceful well-being. 

I've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force and many more.

Since we express ourselves through these Energy centres. They can, as well as our physical and spiritual bodies, hold trapped negative energy. Once tension, trauma, fears and anxiety are released from these Energy centers, the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual bodies also end up healing.

If you want to learn how to really tap into these centers with an effective method to heal them here's a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/vjV75hRXxDY) for you."

Then I remembered that some time ago I spent a morning writing down any thoughts that came, and I decided to do it this morning. So I carried around a pad and pen and wrote as many thoughts as I could whilst I went about my day.

They were mostly negative, which didn't surprise me, but what was good was that I started to try and have longer gaps between thoughts, so I'd have less to write. And the more the day went on, the better I felt. I became less scared of the thoughts and more accepting of the anxiety. I remembered to be mindful when washing up, and I had a great conversation with my mum on the phone. 

I'll try this tomorrow too. It was funny because a lot of the thoughts were along the lines of ""this is only working because I had a good sleep and it's sunny today, it won't be like this another time""

But the effort seems to be more than worth it."

Amongst tons of other healthy benefits to meditation, feeling my emotions has been the biggest for me. I’m slowly developing my feelings again after pure emotional numbness and apathy. Even started counselling last week. 

Today I realised I have a crush. It feels surprisingly healthy and refreshing. 

I notice my heart beats faster when I think of her and I have this warm sensation in my stomach. 

I notice I only think of this individual in a positive light. I try my best to think negatively of them but it does not change how I feel. I find it interesting how powerful crushes are. 

I have a desire to message them and to meet with them and hold them. 

I also see how I sometimes change conversations with my friends to talk about her. 

It is a shame that I know this person is not for me, however I think this post is a sign for me that once again, meditation really is a miracle drug."

triplecyclonegames	2021-04-04 19:55:17+00:00	"Zero energy expenditure technique. ""I have zero energy available for mental resistance"""	"Hey friends! In the last days I've experimented with a new technique - I want to share it with you.

As you probably know most of the time mental struggle causes the most pain. It's not the anxiety or the feelings or the intrusive thoughts. It's the mental resistance we put up, the fight that prolongs and increases the misery.

So I figured - it takes energy to fight feelings/thoughts. What if you weren't willing to spend any more energy on those useless things? Because it takes ACTIVE energy to put up the mental struggle. Even if you're conscious or not about it. 

Following this train of thought I had the attitude: 

""I don't have energy available to spend fighting sensation/thought X"". 

""I'm not willing to spend any energy on fighting useless internal mental struggles"" 

and my favourite mantra that goes with it:

**""I have zero energy available for mental resistance""** 

Upon adopting this attitude consciously (along with the mantra above) I observed that some internal battles  died down. This resulted in a observable physical feeling of relief, especially in the chest/abdominal area. 

I made a note of this technique and I'll incorporate in future versions of Gamitate (no links but you can google it or click on my profile, it's a meditation game). Yay :) 

I have a couple more novel techniques and mental attitudes which seem to make a difference (which are not included in the Gamitate yet).

I'll share some of those as days go by, as not to overload you and give you time to practice! 

**TLDR: Internal struggle requires mental energy. Consciously withhold the energy (pretend you don't have any energy available for that) and the fuel for struggle will die down. Repeat the mantra: ""I have zero energy available for mental resistance""** 

Try this now if you feel like it! And please, let me know how this works for you in the comments!"

asksomequestionsing	2021-04-04 18:17:34+00:00	Reason for the lack of “progress”	"Hi all,


Just want to share something I noticed in my meditation today. I’ve been meditating regularly for about 5 months now, averaging around 25 min each session.


Today I sat for about 45 minutes and noticed the reason why I haven’t been able to move deeper into meditation: dissociation.


The first layer of dissociation that I had to move through were the distracting thoughts. I maintained awareness of my breathing and body as I moved through these thoughts. It has taken me some months to get past this layer, today.


Then I hit the layer of sensory and emotional dissociation. What it feels like is suddenly being dropped into a warm, silky bath where the outside world, including the senses, are tuned out. What tends to happen now is a shutting down of focus. By the time I become aware of my focus, I’m already 5 daydreams away, deep into some imaginary scenario.


So the tuning out happens concurrently with the daydreaming, which makes me believe that that was my primary defensive response to certain past events.


I noticed at some points today when I was able to get under that warm dissociative bath by bringing awareness to my chest/emotional centre (as much as I could), I would feel bits of fear, disgust, and panic bubble up. Then I would space out again and float back up to the layer of distracting thoughts.


That’s all that I have to share, thanks. Let me know if you have similar experiences!"

"I was curious about meditation in my search for power and control but me being myself was terrified of the idea of failing and then loosing all interest. So basically all I did was read a ton of books on spirituality and meditation and that was it and is pretty much what i am doing rn on this sub😅. I want to change that. My biggest problem is maintaining a posture- years of hunching forward has made it painful to sustain a n erect posture and add to it a bit of tummy whose weight i guess pulls me further. Next issue- boredom, i don't think following your breath as a technique works for me, even counting is bettet but it seems hopeless. What I am looking out of meditation is a stable and empowering sense of self/being, lowering my propensity to become anxious, balancing the various stuffs of life, overcoming internet addiction, obsessive tendencies, short attention span, health."
god-baby	2021-04-04 16:23:24+00:00	Does anyone else have the same random locations from your past pop into your head while meditating?	"This doesn’t negatively or positively affect my practice but I’m just curious. When I meditate for some reason I always get taken back or remember very random locations from my past or childhood. 

It’s always the same places too. For some reason I always think of the road that led to my grandma’s house and also an old video store we used to go to in my hometown as a kid. Is there any reason my brain always associates these locations with sitting, breathing and meditating?

It worked out alright in the beginning, then my cat started to object to me sitting quietly for too long. I tried making sure all his needs had been met before sitting down to meditate. I tried picking a different spot to meditate in. I tried encouraging him to sit in my lap while I meditate. Sometimes this works; most of the time he insists on sitting just out of reach and then starting to meow as soon as I close my eyes. Choosing a different time of day, like during one of his naps, seems to be the best course of action. It's just slightly difficult remembering to do that as soon as I see him snoozing. I'm really just venting because I imagine I can't be the only person having similar hiccups in their meditation practice. Mine just happens to be an adorable pain in the butt that I love."

Perrytheplatypus03	2021-04-04 12:19:30+00:00	Meditation for shutting out outer noise. Advice highly appreciated &lt;3	"Hi there :) - semi long post. Sorry.

I have general anxiety (+ panic attacks once in a while) and high stress levels most of the day. Sometimes it leads to a lot of abdominal pain due to overproduction of acid.. It has gotten a lot worse this last year because of extremely loud neighbors who blasts loud ""techno"" music almost everyday. I've done what I can (talked to them, left nice notes, filed a complaint). I'm trying to find another place to live, but I can't afford a more expensive apartment and I'm very low on the waiting lists on the cheaper ones. One day I'm getting a house in the country with sweet sweet tranquility.

But for now, I'm stuck. I can't control what happens in life, but I can control how I perceive and react to it. Therefore I'm trying to meditate everyday and when their music is louder than my own soft music, I put on headphones and try to focus on my own music or a sound book. I know it's a proces but it's so hard not to get sucked in and get anxiety attacks, worry about if the noise is there when I get home etc. But I'm trying my best.

If anyone has any advice that could help me get better at focusing on my inner body and not outer noises I would highly appreciate it. Today I just broke down and cried."

Recently I have been practicing the meditation where I would spend 10 minutes focusing on my breath only and trying to get rid from all other mental activities during those 10 munutes.

By googling I learned that this kind of meditation is called a mindfulness meditation and that its purpose is to improve attention and calm down emotions when doing a mental work. Also, I found out that there are present different from the mindfulness mediation kinds of meditations. And those different kinds serve different purposes.

Now I am curious to know all the basics of meditation including all its kinds. For that I would hope to find a well structured books which would introduce me to basic ideas/approaches one by one in a consistent manner."

I found it SO easy to just go completley mindless and really fall into my past emotions/trauma, within 5 or so minutes my eyes began twitching and tears streamed down my cheeks. I mentally faced my abuser of 6 years with fearlessness in early abusive scenarios and a huge rush of even more tears and emotion rushed over me. I know it may sound dramatic, but the experience seriously felt like I had just won a ""war"" with peace and conquering this ""trauma bond."" I had invisioned myself as a warrior, telling myself positive phrases reliving my past experiences.

My question is, what the HELL did I experience? and is this normal for a first timer? I'm honestly overwhelmed at how positively doing this ONE time has done for my mental health and I've already began looking into Buddhism!?"

The first step is called ""Right view"" which involves seeing the reality as it truly is, as described by the flawless wisdom being called the Buddha. Aspects of right view would include a belief in reincarnation, realms, that karma makes reality and gods and randomness do not exist, that freedom from suffering is possible and that the Buddha is the true  sage, superior to all others who peddle half-truths like Christianity or HInduism. Without right view all  meditation is going to do for you is lead to delusion. Secular meditation may make you a calmer person as you throw old ladies from their homes to get rich in reverse mortgage scams, etc."

melniqoff	2021-04-04 07:06:43+00:00	What makes the brain suffer?	"Hello, my friend. Today, I would like to share my findings with you about the brain and suffering. How does the brain make us suffer? Does the cure even exist? I've spent some time researching these issues, and I have found a lot of stuff that might help you to find answers to these questions.

I'd to say that **I am not a neuroscientist or psychologist,** but I am keen on these topics and dedicate much of my time to them.

### 

### Three brain networks

There are three main networks in our brains: the default mode network, the central executive network, and the salience network:

1. The central executive network is in charge of goal-oriented activities and cognitively demanding tasks. It is essential for problem-solving, decision making, and maintaining attention. So, when you pay attention to something, this network gets activated.
2. The default mode network is responsible for a lot of stuff but is mostly known for mind-wandering. It activates when you do nothing. Self-referential thoughts, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, judging people who have acted unfairly to you, the DMN is responsible for all of these. And by the way, **people with depression or ADHD have increased activity in the default mode network. \[1\]\[2\]**
3. The salience network is much unknown but responsible for switching between the default mode network and the central executive network.

The central executive network and the default mode network are anti-correlated. When one of these networks is activated, the other one deactivates. You cannot use them simultaneously. It means that if you are focused, you cannot ruminate anything in your head. You are free from this mental suffering. On the other hand, if you are not focused or mindful, you invite this self-referential stuff into your mental world.

### 

### The healing power of mindfulness

According to what scientists have found, in order to suffer less (or to be happier), we should reduce the DMN activity. In order to reduce the DMN activity, we should engage with the world, we should pay attention to things.

Let's take a look at mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness encourages us to engage with the world around us and pay attention to everything that arises in the present moment. When you start meditating, you pay attention to your breathing. The central executive network is activated. When you get distracted and start mind-wandering, you don't pay attention to anything. The default mode network is activated. Therefore, by meditating, you train your brain to live using the central executive network more and more. You are kind of creating a new default mode for your brain. On a psychological level, this curiosity, openness, and acceptance of the present moment help us to be connected with the world around us rather than with our thoughts.

Some people might say that it's not necessary to meditate since I can engage with the present moment when I am washing the dishes or driving my car. But from my experience, it's impossible to become **STEADILY** mindful without building a strong daily habit of meditation practice.

### 

### Problem-solving, decision making, and planning

Some people might also think: 'Well if my self-referential thoughts disappear how is it possible to plan the future, solve complicated problems and make decisions?'. As far as I can tell, real thinking is a hard process that requires our attention. When it comes to mind-wandering, it doesn't look like real thinking, it looks like a mental fart. I think that your own experience tells the same, but we can also refer to what some scientists talk about it:

1. **Gary Weber** is a scientist who has practiced more than 20,000 hours of meditation. He claims that more than 90% of the time he has no self-referential thoughts. Problem-solving and decision-making become much easier and more spontaneous (creative) for him than before since there are no such distractions as self-referential thoughts. \[3\]
2. **Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi** is known for the state of flow. \[4\] The most successful businessmen, scientists, and artists reported that great solutions come to their minds after intense concentration. When they get to the state of flow, they act spontaneously, without any efforts as if there is no self, no separation between them and their task. It's kinda short-term enlightenment, so to speak.
3. **Raichle Marcus** is known for the discovery of the default mode network. He said in an interview that when we talk intentionally, activity in the DMN is decreased. \[5\]

So, don't worry about planning, problem-solving, and decision-making. These things are getting better if you are mindful and focused.

### 

### Final words

I would like to say that there are many unexplored things about how our brain works. So, don't consider these videos, researches, and articles as the ultimate truth. It's an ongoing process. Nevertheless, from my experience, it seems solid. I meditate regularly, and it has changed my life a lot. I hope it helps and inspires you to start meditating or keep practicing. Have a nice day 🙂

SmolPPGangg	2021-04-04 06:59:56+00:00	"Really happy with meditation, I had no idea it was so effective for anxiety."	"Apparently I was in an anxious/neurotic state 24/7.

My stress got so bad I decided to just sit down for 30 minutes and breath. My brain absolutely loved it!

I'd never felt such relief and for so long.

If I do 30 minutes in the morning, I'm usually good for the rest of the day. 

It also seems like everyday I just ""feel"" better mood-wise. 

I still have a bit of anxiety inducing moment, but my brain recalibrates more quickly.

Anyways, very happy."

I am finding often that I am cutting my sit time short, simply because it feels over. I am doing well with keeping my attention on my breathing, but it doesn't seem that interesting. My mind does wander, but I do my best not to engage my thoughts. Instead, I bring my attention back to my breathing. It just feels like breathing in the dark. I guess this is called dullness. So that's it. I will keep doing it. I am reading *The Mind Illuminated*, and it says the first step is to establish a routine. Keeping my sit time short is helping me to keep doing it everyday, so I guess I am doing that part right. I have done some longer sits, but it still just feels like breathing in the dark."

Two minutes into my meditation and my mind decided it was a good idea to freak out for no discernible reason. Heart rate seemed to hit 1000, rapid breathing, tingling, tightening sensations. Felt so strange to just observe them all - remember thinking at one point, ""Wow, my entire body's going absolutely crazy. Holy shit."" I never thought I would be able to detach myself enough from my thoughts and bodily sensations that I could passively sit through something like that. I've been meditating for almost a month now, and I guess if I needed concrete proof that my meditation was having an effect, there it is. I just anchored on the breath and observed my body going crazily and felt all the sensations."

Suspicious_Plant4231	2021-04-04 01:54:38+00:00	How do you guys feel about music while meditating?	"I've read and heard that music while meditating isn't the most ideal way to meditate. It forces your mind to multitask and all that. That said, today, I listened to music while I meditated and I can't tell if the result was helpful or not. 

I had a playlist that was literally called ""peaceful meditation"" on in my earbuds, and I sort of started daydreaming, but it seemed more intense. I completely forgot about the external world (which hasn't happened before) and focused on this daydream. It took place in a nice stone area in a lush green jungle-like biome. I was leading a group of people who were likeminded and had similar goals as I.  We all meditated and traveled together. There were four statues, three of them on each side of the area. At the back was a lion, fiercely looking up and roaring at the sun. Statues of a goat and snake that faced the inside of the area sat on either side of it, both looking straight ahead at the other. There was a forth statue, but it wasn't clear what it was. 

These three animals, when put together, form the mythical creature Chimera. It's sort of a symbol for me, as I often contemplate how each person has different parts of their being and their life, and they must be balanced (Like yin and yang, order and chaos). I tell myself to ""be like a Chimera"" because it's a fierce creature that is comprised of different parts, yet they all come together to create a force to be reckoned with. It may be dumb, but it helps me. 

Anyway, I saw what I wanted to happen in the future. I want to travel the world and gain a deeper understanding of myself. I want to meet people from all over, but most of all I want to meet people like me. I want to see different places and learn all I can from each place. I want to continuously better myself. This daydream, or whatever you want to call it, gave me more insight on what I want from life. That said, it could've just been a silly fantasy. 

So, what do you think? Does music help you meditate, or is no music more beneficial? Or both?"
sosmeditate	2021-04-04 00:41:32+00:00	What Does it Mean by Spiritual Awareness?	"**The Ancient Greek aphorism “Know Thyself” invites us to self-reflect; to look at ourselves and to understand our true nature, and having done so, to live our true nature. But what is our true nature? Are we simply the body that we come into this world with, that ages with time and withers away after death? Are we the mind that grows astute with intellectual pursuits only to evaporate at the time of death? Are we our emotions that change as frequently as the weather? Or is there much more to our “selves”? Is there something more constant, more powerful that defines our true self?**

 **Saints and spiritual Masters, since time immemorial, have come to remind us that we are much more than the body that we see with our physical eyes, much more than our mind or emotions. They tell us that our true self is the spirit or soul. They tell us that the soul is a part of God, the Creator and that it is the Power that enlivens the body, that animates us, that makes us tick. When this Power leaves us, the body becomes motionless, and we are proclaimed dead. Saints also tell us that there is a way for each of us to experience our true nature. It is not an intellectual pursuit, but one of practice, wherein we can have a direct experience of our true self.**

**Currently, we are asleep and ignorant of this truth. To become** [spiritually aware](https://www.sos.org/spirituality/spiritual-awareness/) **is to awaken to our true nature as spirit, to experience our true self. Spirituality is the process of discovering our true self. We normally think that perception is possible only through our bodily sense organs. Nevertheless, when we become spiritually aware, we recognize that we can perceive with the spirit.**

**An empowered soul** **is a soul that has recognized itself and is aware that it is** **the essence** **of** **who we really are, that is the guiding power behind the body and mind.–**[SANT RAJINDER SINGH JI](https://www.sos.org/sant-rajinder-singh/) **MAHARAJ**"

TheCozyYogi	2021-04-03 23:52:57+00:00	Having a hard time with “exiting” meditation.	"I’m fairly new to meditation as a whole and I’ve surprised myself with how easy it is for me to get in “the zone”, but I’m finding it very difficult to come out of it in a way that doesn’t essentially cancel out the calming experience.

Some things i’ve read recommend for beginners to set timers and try to stretch their meditations from five minutes to ten, to twenty, to thirty, and so on. I’ve tried setting alarms that are relatively calm/soft music but even then it can be quite jarring to be so deep in the experience and suddenly brought back to reality. 

Additionally, in the rare case that my meditation is interrupted by some external cause (someone opening the door/entering the room earlier than expected), I’m extremely jarred and can’t help feeling frustrated and upset, which very quickly negates the tranquility I was experiencing only seconds before. 

I know not much can be done for the latter other than trying to find a more private place where potential interruptions will be eliminated, but can anyone advise on how to retain the calm and not quickly feel frustrated/disappointed? And when not interrupted, how to you prefer to end your meditations in a productive way?"

Halfway through my practice, I experienced an increased heart rate - it was so intense that I even considered stopping meditation because I've never experienced such a reaction from my body.  I managed to calm myself, and then my heart rate accelerated again. I'd say it felt quite uncomfortable for me, but I somehow pushed through.

Has anyone experienced something similar? What do you do when it occurs? Does it indicate some health issues?"

&amp;#x200B;

I've been curious about this subject, while searching online I could find some information on how to do it but I still have some questions. I'm interested in learning from someone that can do this already, if they could answer about some of the most wacky claims about khechari mudra. 

I do believe that it can trigger intense subjective experiences due to the nerve endings there are in that region, visions and hyper hemispherical synchronization. That part makes sense to me as it is something that has been demonstrated to exist for sure. And it's something that can be done in regular meditation as well. No mystery there.

 But I wanted to know why is it that yogis will say the nectar from khechari mudra will make it so that ***you no longer need to eat and will become immune to snake bites, disease, decay and death.***

That part is the point of this post, is this some sort of metaphorical text or figure of speech that everybody adopts?

I mean, it can't be literal otherwise we would see 500 year old yogis walking around, so what does this mean really to become immune from decay and death?"

chuckles67	2021-04-03 18:10:43+00:00	Adam Sandler Inspires Me to Meditate	"Okay, that title is a little clickbaity. More accurately, the movie Click (2006) inspires me to meditate. 

For those unfamiliar with the film, the basic premise is that Adam Sandler's character has a remote control that allows him to fast forward through the parts of his life he doesn't want to experience, e.g. sitting in traffic, fighting with his spouse, being bored etc. Eventually, he fast forwards far enough into future only to realize that his life is in shambles. His marriage has fallen apart and he's utterly disconnected from his friends and family. During those times when he was in fast-forward mode, he was essentially on autopilot. He was there physically, but not *present*.

To me, this is the perfect metaphor for being lost in thought. When we're lost in thought, we're essentially on autopilot. We're having a conversation, but not really paying attention. We're laughing, but not experiencing the joy that laughter brings. We're with our family and friends, but not really engaged. 

I think about this movie often and remind myself to take the time to appreciate the fact that without meditation, one day I could look back on my life and notice that so much time has been spent consumed by thought that opportunities to enjoy the nuances of life have been missed. 

Remember my friends, every moment we're alive is a new moment  to be truly present and enjoy the things that are happening in the moment."

do not surrender to those thoughts, but become aware, once you have done that, direct it, to where it needs to be/belongs, then you can move onto using elements, like fire to cleanse and refine.  


visualisation is key to create some certain changes, next you want to ask a question or create the intent of what you want to create, empower it, then you can also visualize a cyan light from the center of the mind and move it downwards into the hand and feel it, breath  into it, breath out from it, then from one hand to the other, up back into the mind and into the subconscious, energize.  


from there you could gain a little insight from visions from daydreams, it could be a situational awareness thought, like what if? this happened etc.   
Done.  
whatever happens from there I wish you peace and vigilance

nolza95	2021-04-03 14:30:23+00:00	One simple yet powerful meditation technique	" 

If you are a meditation expert, you can meditate lying down, walking, or sitting down.

But, if not, the fact that you sit down is very important.

It is easy to fall asleep when lying down and scatter when walking, so I usually sit down.

However, sitting posture tends to put a lot of strain on the back and legs, and this is the point.

The beauty of meditation is being psychologically very light, and becomes close to the state just before falling asleep, such as lowered brain waves, pulse, blood pressure, and breath. 

Pain in the lower back and legs is hidden behind the scenes by'not paying attention' due to the increase in blood concentration of anandamide and'pain control effect' due to the increase in endorphin. Among them, it triggers the hyperactivity of the vagus nerve, which is directly connected to the brain. Maybe this could explain Daejucheon or Kundalini.

Under normal circumstances, vagus nerve fainting may occur and fall, but the meditator maintains the same blood pressure and brain waves as if it had already collapsed, so I guess that the shock could trigger a shift in consciousness such as DMT endogenous generation.

Even if you can't get to this level, it's a pity that modern people can't quite feel the sensibility to melatonin, the melancholy, and the receptive state that you feel when you're seeing the change of brightness getting darker as the sun goes down in the countryside. Such an experience can be the simplest yet powerful meditation.

The meditation app' deFrown' was created with this background. Pivot from the meditation app to the wrinkles app, then back to the wrinkles + meditation app that taps and stretches both the body and mind. Turn off the lights before going to bed and Try 'deFrown', Test your ability to relax"
peaceiseverystepp	2021-04-03 14:21:41+00:00	Seven key attitudes for a happy life according to Jon Kabat Zinn	"**Non-judgment** - paying attention to your opinions as they arise. JKZ talks about how the human mind sorts things into boxes - good, bad, neutral. By taking a perspective of non-judgement and being aware we can take the most joy from the good things, accept the bad things (doing us less harm), and become more aware of the neutral things, realising how much they contribute to our lives. Of course judgmental thoughts still arise but we can simply observe them and let them pass without acting on them.


**Patience** - letting things unfold in their own time. Meditation isn’t difficult to learn but it does require patience and persistence. It takes some time to see the benefits of it, you need to stick with it. Doing it once a week is helpful but when you make time for a little bit of practice every day for six weeks the evidence shows its actually rewiring how your brain works, you’re training yourself to be happy. Its also about being patience with ourselves, not setting expectations for achieving a standard in a specific time, and being patient with others who have lived their life through a set of circumstances we’re not aware of. 


**Beginners mind** - seeing the world as if for the first time and seeing the infinite possibilities. Knowledge can limit our perception of what we don’t know, part of becoming wise (rather than clever) is getting comfortable with what we don’t know. When we accumulate a lot of knowledge and become jaded by experience we can lose touch with the joy in our lives.


**Trust** - listening to our bodies and our senses. Trusting that if we let go of anxieties about the future and regrets from the past and live in the present that everything will be OK - because it really will. When we cultivate trust in ourselves through practice, when we build our calmness and peace and live in the present moment  we start to trust other people more because we’re not jumping ahead to what they might do or questioning their motives - we’re existing in the present taking their words and actions at face value. Really listening to other people with an open mind is when we make strong human connections. 


**Non-striving** - we’re always trying to get somewhere, always running toward a destination. But an important aspect of mindfulness is realising that you have arrived in the here and now. We can’t live happily in the future; if everything we’re doing is to achieve, we sacrifice our wellbeing in the present. We tell ourselves we’ll be happy when we get promoted, we get married, we have kids, when we retire. This is the only time we can be happy - mindfulness is called the art of stopping, sometimes we have to ease off with the future plans and enjoy where we are and who we’re with.


**Acceptance** - accepting that things are the way they are. Which is not to say you don’t do anything about it, the idea is that you are aware in the present moment, you see things as they are and you can decide what it is you want to do. There’s a myth that mindfulness somehow makes you OK with injustice and suffering - the opposite is true! When we accept the world in front of us, accept people, accept yourself, you can act out of emotional intelligence and compassion rather than anger or fear. 


**Letting go** - by identifying the attachments we have we can trace the roots of our anger, our fear, our sadness and understand why we react the way we do in certain circumstances. Once we apply our awareness to our attachments we can start to understand ourselves, we can start to feel compassion for ourselves, then we can start to let go of our suffering.

massiveyacht	2021-04-03 12:07:53+00:00	Now I Am...	"This is a question I’ve started asking myself, in order to bring myself into the present. It’s making such a difference to my days, and making things that I’ve found quite hard a lot easier.

Often when I do chores, I’m angry and resentful. I think about all the things I would rather be doing. I huff and puff, and get distracted, and the whole task takes ages and is stressful and annoying. So I don’t really do a great job on the chore.

Then often when I try to relax, or do fun things, I’m worried and tense. I think about all the things I need to do, or ‘should’ be doing, and how little time I have to do them, and why aren’t I doing them NOW god damn it! Am I lazy or something? So I don’t really get to relax.

Now if I’m washing dishes, for example, whenever my mind wonders, or I get angry or resentful, I’ve tried saying to myself “now I am…washing dishes”. And I gently bring my attention back to the present moment, and the task in hand. This is what I’m doing right now.

And if I’m relaxing and watching TV, I say to myself ‘now I am…watching TV’, and I pay attention to the fact I am relaxing. This is what I’m doing right now.

It makes life a lot simpler, because now I only have to concentrate on one thing at a time. I’m worrying less about what I ‘should’ be doing, because I know everything has its time and place, and I know when I’m doing what I need to do, I will be concentrated and present.

Unfortunately surfing the internet is a terrible counter to this!"

"It's easier to be present and be one with awareness when you're doing a formal meditation at home where there's not really anything much going on externally. The real challenge is staying present when you're going about your daily life in the world because the world is full of people who are only living on the level of the mind, identified with their egos so it's easy to get pulled back into that way of being.

A helpful practise is to remind yourself throughout the day to stay in the present and remain as the awareness, instead of getting entangled in thoughts, feelings and reactions."

adriadriando	2021-04-03 07:25:32+00:00	Meditation and Sleep/Dreams	"Hey everyone,

I'm a beginner at meditating (just over a month in) and I have to admit that I struggle to meditate every day– I usually only end up doing it maybe 4-5 days in a week right before I go to bed which is when I feel I have the most time and focus. Because I'm a bit inconsistent I've actually started to notice a difference in how I end up sleeping if I've meditated before or not.

If I don't meditate, it takes me a while to fall asleep (because my mind is focusing on unpleasant thoughts, no surprises there), then I sleep through the night but when I wake up I'm super groggy and stay in bed for a good hour or so in half-awake mode trying to get up/fall asleep again, which doesn't feel very good.

If I do meditate, I end up falling asleep much more easily and when I wake up I'm more alert and able to get out of bed in maybe 15 minutes. I sleep the same amount of time in both events BUT invariably every single time I meditate before bed, I wake up in the middle of the night from very vivid dreams, sometimes multiple times (not bad or good dreams, just strong enough to wake me up apparently).   

I'm not surprised that I fall asleep better and wake up feeling better after meditating, but does anyone have any insight or experience with the dreaming aspect? Waking up from vivid dreams has never been a common occurrence with me until just a week or two ago and I'm curious if it has something to do with the meditating right before sleep or maybe it just correlates to something else going on in my life right now!"

I hear a lot about trying to be mindful and present as much as you can during the day, but surely its good to think about the past and the future so we can learn from the past and prepare for the future? So what is the correct amount of time to be present because I see a lot of people trying to be ""present"" all day and that just doesn't make much sense to me. Maybe you need to think about the past / future until that thinking starts hurting you instead of helping you. What are your thoughts on this? Thanks!"

True-Repeat	2021-04-03 04:58:02+00:00	"Please help? I’ve started rocking uncontrollably while meditating, and am hoping for some insight."	"I started mindfulness meditation using an app a couple of years ago. Since January, I’ve been taking a tantric meditation class online. I’m a newbie. 

The past three times I’ve meditated, I’ve gotten into such a zone that my abs / core start churning in a clockwise motion. It is all involuntary - “I” feel like a narrator who is enjoying an amusement park ride. Today, I just allowed myself to go with the flow, as long as I could. For about 4 minutes, I sat on the edge of my bed, first swaying in a circular motion, then the direction shifted. It felt like I was being pulled forward and pushed backwards. The motion kept getting stronger and stronger. It was like the force moving me was external, and not internal. I recorded it, and (whoever “I” am) was able to narrate with my voice as it was happening. It felt like someone just “took over” control of my stomach. It ended with me just collapsing on the bed. 

This was such a wild experience. I do not feel scared about this - it was a peaceful  feeling. As if I was being taken care of by someone else. 

I am a skeptic. Before this happened, I would have thought anyone speaking like this had lost it. 

I really want to know if anyone else has experienced this while meditating, and whether you have thoughts on how to proceed if this happens again. For example, immediately “snap out of it” (I knew I could “take control” if I wanted to), or keep enjoying the feeling (not feeling in control was actually a freeing thing, plus I was enjoying what felt like a soothing ab workout). 

Thank you so much."

Eg ""I Surrender"" to me means that the all the stress and issues from that point on shall be handled by the cosmos only and I only try to get one with the cosmos through my 15-20 min meditation session.

Then i follow this practice while day to day chores as well. Whenever i feel pressured. Just remind myself of the cosmic energies and tell myslellf that my share of the game is only my action and leave everything else to the almighty with pure Surrendrance.

Really glad if this helps someone.

Om Shanti 🙏

Sincerity_Amigo	2021-04-03 03:21:46+00:00	The potential for 1 million forests - is in 1 acorn	"How much potential do you think is inside of you right now? 

Everything is energy. You know this. All atoms are energy. All atoms in your body...100% pure energy. You are pure energy. Pure energy is unlimited potential. You are unlimited potential. 

Every atom in your body is the same age as the universe. 

You are unlimited and immortal. Science has proven this to you. Treat yourselves and everything around you as the unlimited and immortal beings that you all are and you get healthier, you get better looking, have better opportunities, which leads to more wealth, and because of your good mental health you are also having better relationships. Your universe will change. Pretty dramatically when you treat it like the infinite universe that it is. 

But because we are doing this dance together - we need each other. We are Interdependent. Not dependent. Not independent. Interdependent. If we treat it all perfectly - it will all be perfect. Technology and medicine can now treat most things that used to be impossible to live with. 

Find harmony with yourself  
Find harmony with your friends and family.   
Learn to harmonize with strangers.  
Study what brings harmony to your environment and home.   
Find what it means for your brain to be in harmony. Meditate on it. What does it feel like when your brain is in harmony? Just tell your brain ""I am harmonizing now"" as you meditate. Then proceed to do whatever comes to you in that moment as you follow your breath. 

Let go of everything. Just harmonize with the present moment. You do not need anything in this moment, except harmony. Admit it. That is what you want. You want complete inner peace. So harmonize. Once you learn to harmonize your brain, then you can start to take that around your environment and then around people. You do at least one thing where your brain is able to find harmony. Painting, dancing, laughing, holidays, vacations, church, prayer, meditation, yoga, orgasms, LSD (if a good trip), surfing, basketball, Whatever makes you happy. Your brain is fully in the moment and harmonizing. That's a feeling you made with your brain. Not the thing itself - you. It was all you. You don't need it. Its there to show you that its possible and all you need to do is pay attention to how your consciousness is reacting in those moments. Study your breath in those moments. Study your body. How does your brain feel? Which parts are lighting up? Really pay attention when you feel happy. That's harmony. Cultivate it through meditation and doing more of the things you love. Its that easy. Just do what you love and brings you to harmony with yourself and your environment. Seems like heaven to me. The day still seems pretty beautiful and the night seems pretty beautiful.

Nature is in harmony, as long as its there it is in harmony, because its natural. It doesn't think about it. It just does nature. If you leave it alone it will produce rainforests, jungles, elephants, duckbilled platypus, venus fly traps, and all sorts of cool stuff. You don't have to do anything. Just leave it alone. Isn't that cool? You can go visit - but when you are there you s- find harmony with it. 

Try a mediation on harmony. Imagine yourself like one of those Tesla balls. Feeling the electricity coming off every part of your body and brain as you float in harmony with your mediation area. Watch a video online of one. The way it seems to be in perfect harmony. Feel it through your whole body and through your hair. Feel it through your spine and chest.  Feel it underneath you. Feel your whole body in perfect harmony. Pay attention to how this feels. If you can take that feeling with you throughout your day, it makes for a really enjoyable experience. All the time. Everywhere. All you have to do is try and you can learn to harmonize all day long. Floating around like a Telsa ball is fun. Its how you feel when you are truly happy. Light on your feet. Light in your heart. You can feel it. Its like a tightening on your chest.

It takes study. Learn what helps your body and mind harmonize. Write it down. Learn what helps your relationships harmonize. Write it down. It just takes you to want to do it. The effort is all on you and its as easy as getting a notebook and pen. Because once you have those you have already made the decision to find harmony. And the universe will give it to you if you ask. If youre sincere about it. Dont you want harmony in your everyday life? Peace, love, and joy - every single day. Your life in total harmony. If we all do it, then we can reduce the risk of creating more disharmony. So follow your dreams, do what you love, and find harmony. That's pretty fun."

For example, the best conversations occur when you aren't at all focused on the present moment or what you're saying, you just kind of drift off with the conversation.  It's the same thing with playing music.  I always worry that meditating will make me less able to do these things over time.  Is this anyone's experience?"
halcyon9689	2021-04-03 00:11:17+00:00	How to detach from my ego?	"When I’m meditating for awhile, and thinking about my life, I can usually dispel any anxiety I have over most of my egoic preoccupations. But the one kernel I can’t seem to overcome is jealousy of other/envy of others/coveting their success and joy. It keeps me stuck in a very angry depression. I don’t feel good enough or like I’ll never have those things I want because I’m a bad person. I feel like I don’t have enough in my life and that I’m being left behind. 

When I try to detach, it always ends in the thought that “one day they will die and I will die and none of this will matter” which makes me more depressed. 

I need to overcome these eroding thoughts."
Bbp1954	2021-04-02 23:38:20+00:00	Control Yourself Through Meditation	"In hustle and bustle of life, our mind and body exhaust and resign to daily pressure and stress we face. Physical illnesses may be treated with medicines but soul, which controls our morale, motivation and happiness, cannot be cured with scientific measures. To evaluate your emotions and bring harmony to feelings, you must practice meditation along with other tasks of your life. It relaxes your nerves and muscles and brings peace to your inner structure, which allows greater efficiency in other activities.

Although it's an intangible mechanism, sill there is some themes that are followed for each distinct technique of meditation. It starts with understanding your own self, the pattern of nature and how both work coherently to bring peace. So instead of beginning the meditation practices [randomly,read about the philosophy and underlying rules of that particular activity.](https://glitzland.blogspot.com/2021/04/meditation-for-beginners.html)

Once you start believing in unseen structures, you get to step closer to the higher purpose of life. This allows you to stay composed regardless of present condition of your life. Meditation enhances control over feelings and allows you to utilize them for your greater benefit. The moment you become aware of your inner personality traits, you can behave in a more optimistic and constructive manner thus nurturing your social relationships. When your mind becomes healthy, it casts positive impacts on your body and you feel active and competent than before."
Brendan1219	2021-04-02 23:29:13+00:00	Does meditating make anyone else believe more in god.	I have never been a religious person. I didn't grow up in a religious home and I never really thought much about god growing up. Once I hit high school I was more agnostic than an atheist because I thought it was foolish to say that there is no god when I have no idea. But whenever I meditate I feel a connection toward a higher power that is very difficult to take with me throughout the day when I'm not meditating. Just wondering if anyone has experienced this and what your advice is about staying connected to this feeling/higher power

"I am working on building back a regular meditation practice as part of a holistic approach to deal with stress/anxiety/burnout. Traditionally, the instruction is to focus on your breath and to let the body breath naturally. 

Is there any downside to instead doing intentional deep breathing and using that as the anchor for the meditation? I’ve been trying this with 4 second inhales, 1 second pause, 8 second exhales, 1 second pause to try to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. 

I’ve been doing hour long sessions and it really seems to be helping with anxiety lately. Curious to hear everyone’s thoughts and experiences."

so I was watching the new meditation show “Headspace guide to Meditation” and I actively participated in it. At the 3. episode it was about appreciation and learning to love life again. But when I dropped the question what I appreciate in life the only thing that came up was the feeling of salvation while having a mental breakdown. So letting my feelings out and not holding them back. I dont understand this because in those moments I just want everything to stop (especially the hurting) even though that I know those are just my real feelings . I dont know if I should go see a therapist or not, I dont know anything really. I would appreciate ;) some advice especially if keep on meditating will help me understand it."

AI algorithms have pushed us to the boundaries of stimulation, making our lives in quarantine feel dull in comparison.

But as effective as these algorithms are at distracting us - giving us that little hit of dopamine to keep us addicted - there are some of us that believe these powerful algorithms can also help us become more fulfilled.

My heart goes out to everyone who has been effected by the events of this last year. During the pandemic, I learned to build apps so I could better share my love for meditation, and make free resources available for anyone. I’m incredibly grateful for [all the support and encouragement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/i0zuyd/i_built_a_meditation_app_for/) this subreddit has brought me when I shared my first meditation app here.

Since then, I’ve been learning how to use data science for social good. I just finished building a little experiment that uses machine learning to understand which types of guided meditations work the best for you. 

We can do great things by working together. Everyone here has so much experience to help beginners, but I realize it’s hard to get your voice out there. Because of this, I’ve also been improving this app to become a place where anyone can contribute and learn about meditation. Teachers can feel free to link donation buttons &amp; courses in the app :)

weIIokay38	2021-04-02 20:14:16+00:00	Why would I want to 'observe the observer'?	"I've been doing the Sam Harris Waking Up course lately, and the past few episodes just haven't made any sense to me. He's started talking about 'observing the observer' and 'looking for the thinker', and... I just don't want to?

The reason why I meditate is because I want a tool that can help me handle my anxiety, the mood swings that come from ADHD, and the *incredibly* intrusive thoughts that come with my OCD. That's all I care about. Thanks to my anxiety, I already have a severely distorted picture of reality (I experience a **ton** of dissociation and derealization), and all these episodes do is trigger that. 'Looking for the observer' sounds like it's putting me back in that space, and *I don't want to be in that space*.

I like feeling centered. I like feeling connected to my body. Meditation fixes dissociation and derealization for me, and I don't want to 'ascend' beyond that. I don't care if humans are biological state machines, if I'm 'connected to the universe', etc., I just want a tool to manage my own mind malfunctioning. When I see people talking about 'ego death' on here, and how they've 'ascended past the self' or something like that, it just kinda triggers my anxiety and makes me feel like it's neurotypical people trivializing the experiences I've had with my dissociation and derealization.

Just wanted to get that off my chest. Is it okay in meditation for me to just stick to one level? Is it okay for me to just stop where I feel comfortable? I *like* my ego, I like the part of me where I feel centered and where my limbs feel like they're part of my body and where the world feels real, that's the kinda experience I want, because the alternative is **fucking terrifying** to me and quite literally hell. Is there something I'm missing here?"
hoborat	2021-04-02 19:52:15+00:00	Any advice for beginner stuck in early stages of meditation?	"I had some very intense experiences using psychedelics and meditating, I become aware of the years of suppressed emotions almost instantly and simply breathe into them, and cry everytime, after crying I start laughing so hard at the amazing pleasure of relief and it's like a giant curtain gets pulled over and life becomes magical. One experience stuck with me on an accidental dose of 6 dried grams (planned to be 2.5) I went through what felt like several layers of consciousness that ended in exhaustion, my mind was still, there was no thought. I just was present, being in the moment and I didn't move or think and the bliss and love I felt is something I know now is all I want to achieve in this life.

But it is not transformative, it gives me a glimpse of what could happen though I truly believe if I can get some habits and discipline going it would help immensly, or to just experience some emotions lol. As my mind takes over and my habits realign themselves and the ego takes over, I have 0 discipline of my mind it's completely untamed and extremely restless, but it feels so damn hard to meditate while completely in the survival state of mind, it's so numb inside and noisy it does feel impossible to break the giant barrier I built to protect myself growing up from the crazy shit I could write about I had to deal with and all. Basically suppression was my ultimate survival tool dealing with abusive people.

I just can't really express how much of a slave to my mind I am, it feels so restless, I got constantly told I have adhd and I will admit I can be really manic when i'm even a little bit happy. and manically depressed i've tried to kill myself in simple thought loops. I

In other words is there a route or a practice anyone could point me to for a type of person who possibly has unusual amounts of thoughts, like crushing amounts that for months tries everyday to meditate but can't get passed a minute without getting crushed by the millions of thoughts I'm having. Or is this normal and I just need to keep trying what i'm doing? 

Thanks"
distantfog89	2021-04-02 19:17:40+00:00	Processing	I’m trying to figure out what my higher power is wanting. Since I have been taking my anxiety pills my mind really hasn’t been raising or it is. I feel like I’m here but not here at the same time. We were watching a Netflix documentary about a guy from SNL and he was talking about childhood trauma. He was saying he needs to tell his story and people at this rehab I’m at say they have a story. But honestly thinking about it I don’t remember or even know my story. I try to think back to when I was growing up and until now and I can’t remember. I know I have childhood trauma but I guess I pushed it so far down that I forgot but not forgot.

machobizdonkwrestler	2021-04-02 19:09:24+00:00	"An obligation to meditate, zero desire"	"Intuitively I know meditation is a beneficial practice.  I practiced for a brief period years ago, then stopped.  I have begun my practice again and had been consistent for 3.5 months up until a couple weeks ago.  As I stated in the title, I have always felt an obligation when I do it, never a desire, often times even a dread whenever I know the time to meditate is approaching.  

I know mindfulness is a key to living a more harmonic, natural and peaceful life.  I just have no desire to sit down at any period of the day and meditate.

I use the 10 Percent App when I meditate and have found the concept of mental noting (ex: when you realize that you are thinking, say the mental note in your head, “thinking”) from the primary teacher I am following (Joseph Goldstein) to be beneficial.  But I do not like the repetitive nature of the practice using the app.

Just looking for some guidance or advice."
snorlaxerr	2021-04-02 19:06:47+00:00	Is it all about strengthening pre-frontal cortex?	"Around 2 years ago I used to be super chill. I used to be frequent weed smoker.
Whenever I smoked weed, I felt the effects all over my brain.

Until a year ago I used to be super stressed. I was convinced my prefrontal cortex was gone and was ready to get a brain scan, until a doctor told me it is nothing but my stress, because whenever I smoked weed, I would feel every part of my brain except frontal. 

Whenever I meditate and try to focus on my body, I feel the lower back part of my brain deactivating &amp; my frontal part activating. I feel more relaxed. 

Now when I smoke weed, I feel something in my frontal part too, tho not as much as I used. I am very very de-stressed compared to a year ago.

So, my question is - Is meditation all about strengthening your pre-frontal cortex so you can manage your stress better and be present in the moment?"

I was going through one of the daily guides and the focus was on gazing into the space behind your eyelids. Sam was talking about focusing on the thoughts that arise, and I had a few flash by. Stupid things, like a potato (idk why lol), what my living room looked like before I left the house, or nothing which let me focus on the darkness behind my eyelids. But for a second or two, I felt like I teleported to another place. I could see white, sun-bleached sand all around my vision field. There were blue skies in the background and not a cloud in sight. Directly in front of me was a small, skinny palm tree. I could hear seagulls and waves crashing behind me. I could smell the salty air. And as quick as it came, the beach scene was gone. I was then focused on the dark space behind my eyelids again. 

Is this a normal part of the practice? I didn't recognize the beach I was on, but it felt so real. Honestly, it was super refreshing. Wish I was able to spend more time there!"
genbuggy	2021-04-02 17:09:08+00:00	Questions about meditation for my newbie husband and my more experienced self	"I have been meditating on and off for several years.   I have been encouraging my husband to join me in this adventure since I began.  In early February, after we were both very stressed about a tragedy in our local community, my husband decided that he wanted to join me in daily meditation. 

I have experimented with a number of different meditation techniques over the years but have never been formally taught or found a specific technique that absolutely resonates with me.  I am open to trying lots of methods.   

The only time we can meditate together is immediately after our kids go to bed at night.   We have meditated together every evening since February 9.  We sit in a quiet, dimly lit room together and set a timer (currently for 20 minutes).  

I have decided to let him take the lead on figuring out which approach he prefers since I dont want to influence him (and I can easily convince him to do most things).  We have followed a few guided meditations.  We have tried awareness of breath.  We have done a couple of mantra based sessions.   Last night we followed a guided Metta meditation.  He doesn't love any of them.  After each session I will ask if he enjoyed that technique and he is always rather insure.  He also doesn't see any significant changes from almost two months of consistent practice.  He is committed to doing this practice daily because he has heard countless accounts of its importance but he wants some input on how to best go about finding his personal style. 

As for me, I have developed, over the years, a personal approach that I like.  I have found since meditating with him however, that I don't go nearly as ""deep"" as I used to when I meditated alone.   Although I have some ideas as to why I'm feeling this, I'd be open to hearing opinions about this from others.

Since I'm consciously working to keep my opinions out of his journey, I thought I would ask this community to share their thoughts and experiences on different types of meditation and specific strategies for a newbie that is way out of his comfort zone.   Your constructive feedback is greatly appreciated."

SecureBreakfast112	2021-04-02 15:08:51+00:00	Can I get the Silva method sounds without their guidance?	"Hi all. I'm sorry if this has been asked, but I couldn't find anything. I did the centering meditation (I believe) of the silva method and loved the background sound, but I couldn't get into their guidance. I have found that I really respond to vibration and sound or something but do need a little bit of guidance and I was wondering if anyone knew of a resource.
I also love the Sigur Ros sound bath experience in the Calm app, but it's a little shorter than I want sometimes.
I have Aphantasia; I can't visualize in my minds eye. I think this is one reason that sound works so well for me. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you"

"I have debilitating anxiety due to my OCD, I'm on meds but I still feel so much anxiety and it's awful. From what I understood you only have anxiety when you're ruminating.

SamPeachie	2021-04-02 14:43:46+00:00	Ruminating thoughts more invasive!?	"I’m on a 85 day streak with my practice, and I’ve been noticing small benefits. Like general well-being, calm and awareness of my thoughts and feelings. Though, (bear with me for a second as I explain...)I’ve recently signed a new lease agreement and I’m in the process of moving. We are renting a rather rundown old place for super cheap, and happy to do some repairs. I’ve noticed a few things about the building managers already such as asking them to get our carpet deep cleaned prior to move in (required in BC for tenancy longer than 1 year if carpet flooring) and the day we got the keys, the manager left pretty quickly (didn’t do a damage inspection form)... so I examined the carpet and it still had old pet barf on it. He just vacuumed and tried to play it off as if they “got” it cleaned... anyway, back to how this ties into meditation. I’ve been unable to sleep, laid awake for 4+ hours last night just ruminating on all the work that needs to be done and these stories I was making up about potential conflict with the managers, or other tenants in the building (3 story house, 1 unit per level). I’ve never had this much trouble with ruminating thoughts and stress keeping me up... any ideas as to why my practice has seemed to make this aspect worse? I tried to focus on my breath to fall asleep, but it was like I was unable to catch myself drifting into these stories... any ideas? Tips?"

I have tried moving ie opening my eyes, stretching my neck a little, followed by a few deep breaths and then resume the sitting. I realised doing so made me less tense compared with had I resisted the temptation to move. But it also took me a while for me to go back to being as still as the period just before I got restless.

Any advice? How do you deal with this? Thank you."

I struggle meditating when I am stressed about work or personal life issues. Any tips? I understand that it's all in the mind and to ""let go"" but it's hard to do that in reality when you have responsibilities.

Here are some examples:

- When there are tight work deadlines or issues at work.

Even after switching off my laptop, I find it hard to actually switch off mentally. I find myself thinking about what frustrated me, or the incomplete state of ""work"" that I am supposed to finish off etc.

I struggle to concentrate in meditating, my mind is drifting towards some of the thoughts above and I am generally feeling very unpleasant inside.

Does anyone have tips please?

When everything is at peace and under control and life seems hopeful, meditating is fantastic."
_TheRedWolf	2021-04-02 13:13:17+00:00	"When I meditate I can't stop focusing on an specific part of my stomach, and even my mind moves the focus constantly when I breath, making me uncomfortable and anxious."	"I describe it as a dense ""energy"" fluid, moving constantly around my stomach. I was supposed to focus on how my stomach goes up and down, how it expands and then retracts, and that was what I did when I started meditating.

But then, my mind started distracting with, as I described before, a mental fluid that is constantly moving, it's like an imaginary puppy in my abdomen. Sometimes it moves to the left, sometimes to the right, it's never in the middle of my stomach, where my belly button is located. Also, I can't control that ""energy"", it moves on its own.

It's weird. I searched about this but I couldn't find any other case as similar as mine. 

I only feel it when I try to meditate. Rather, I feel it when I simply focus on my stomach. It doesn't affect other areas of my life, just on meditation.

What should I do? Should I move to another type of meditation, or just continue focusing on that energy?"
Matino	2021-04-02 12:57:53+00:00	How to apply mindfulness	"Hi,

During times of frequent practice I sometimes get a sensation og ""waking up"". I become conscious of my actions, but I am unsure how to handle this. For example I can notice an impulse to scratch my head, I can notice the want, or I ""catch"" my hand moving towards my head. What should I do in this situation? Should I just scratch my head? How can I apply the mindfulness in daily life? The same goes for other impulses such as poping joints or small movements, maybe I over time can reduce these impulses. 

In addition I can at times notice that I am thinking, but I'm unsure what to do with this. I notice that I am thinking and can get some distance to the thoughts, but does this have an implication that I don't know? Should I monitor my thoughts and actions? Or just let things be and observe them? 

I have also noticed this in conversation with others, there as well I am unsure. What I have been trying to do in that situation is to direct my attention to the person speak, which I think is a good usage of awareness. 

Thanks in advance for any insight."

antichrome69	2021-04-02 12:00:21+00:00	Death is our greatest teacher	"I have read Michael Singer's ""Untethered Soul"" 18-20 times for the last 2 years and I want to share what I learned that 200% boosted my journey to Buddha. Excuse my grammar (SSSORRYY).

""Death is our greatest teacher"" is such a cosmical paradox. No humans or happenings can teach you more than death does. A wise person knows that moment where you will take your last breath will happen whenever and wherever. A wise person accepts the fact that we can die whenever and wherever. If someone were to teach you how to get rid of your obsession, death solves it by just taking it right away. If someone were to teach you how all lives are equal, death instantly put all lives equally. But, will you just be waiting for it to come when we have that power in ourselves to be awakened? If there is something miserable happening in your life right now, try thinking about death. Let's say you are very insecure and hate seeing your BF/GF talking with others. But is it really right for your loved one to be not loved by anyone and living a lonely life? If you can let your selfishness down for a moment,  you will realize that you wish your loved one to live an abundant life with no doubt. If that is what you truly want, why all the fuss about your loved one talking to others? To motivate yourself to live in a higher-self, death must be with it. Why must you learn the way to higher-self when everything is taken away? A wise person thinks, ""If everything were to change from one breath, I will live in higher-self for the rest of the life. I will not hurt my loved ones. I will be fully honest and live in my deepest side of my existence. "" This is an attitude you need to have deeper and meaningful relationships in your life. Look back in your past time when you treated harshly or rather bitterly to your loved ones. It could be the morning when you yelled at your mom. It could be when you acted selfishly to your friends. We think they will be there for your all the time. It is very difficult to grasp. But what if they die now? What if YOU die? What would you do if the night sky you see right now is the last time you will be seeing your loved ones? Imagine grim reaper comes during your sleep and tells you to pack everything up because, in the next morning, you will be leaving? Then the people you met on that day will be the last time you will be seeing them. Forever. How would you feel? What would you talk about with them? You wouldn't even care about their wrong if it's the last time you will be with them. How much love would you be able to express in your last moment? You will look at your life very differently. Now, we must deeply realize this. Death is not to be creeped out or be scared of. Death is the greatest teacher out of all out there. You don't need to get nervous in front of death. Knowing and accepting death will make you live like every moment in your life matter. As every moment is precious. Even now where you are facing difficulties. A person who knows there is only a week to live will treat every moment in that person's last week very special. That last week will be a million times more meaningful than his/her entire life. What would it be like to live every day like this? A really awesome thing when you accept this deep truth is that you don't need to turn your whole life upside down. You just need to change the attitude towards death. For example, you are a person who takes a walk like million times, at a park. But how many times have you actually experienced the joy from it? Imagine a person who has only a week to live asks a doctor, ""Can I go outside and take a walk?"", ""Can I look upon the sky for the last time?"" Even if there are storms, he/she will be willing to go out for a walk. It is the most important thing for them to do in their last week. However, you hate storms. You either run or use an umbrella. What is it that makes you feel like you are not living? What is it that makes you so scared? We keep ourselves so busy and try so hard so the next thing will go smoothly. We don't live in the present moments. Don't you want to truly LIVE before death comes? There will be no warnings. It is extremely rare for a person to know when he/she will die. Most of us will fail to realize that there is no next breathe. Use your every day, every moment to let go of the fear that stops you from living in present. Because you know death will come to you no matter what, speak the whatever the FK you want. Do what you need to do without hesitation. Don't worry about what would happen next. Turn your awareness to present moments. This is the life of someone who knows and accepts death. You must be able to live like one because you are also facing death as well. Don't be scared of death. Let it be the key to your freedom for your soul. Receive the courage to live your life wholly from death. ""You"" are simply experiencing what is happening. It is not about hoping something to happen. Don't waste your time trying your ass off to make the next thing happen. Be thankful and savor every moment. Live your life as if you are on the edge of the cliff because we all are."

maybemaddy	2021-04-02 09:26:49+00:00	What next?	"I’ve been meditating quite solidly for maybe a month or so. It brings me great relief for anxiety, restlessness and grounding. Initially when I first got into mediation I’d use guided ones but now I either put reiki music on or just silence. I’ve gotten quite good at breathing through the different chakra areas of my body (not the best description sorry I’m a bit tired) and I can feel a pulsing and pressure in my third eye area when I focus using visualisation. I’m curious how I can push my practice on a spiritual level further? I would really like to connect with my higher self and almost channel... images, guidance, support etc. any advice/practices for this?  I know it has only been a short while but I feel as though I want to take a step further but I don’t know what that step is, if that makes sense."
Heelahoola	2021-04-02 08:49:00+00:00	Starting to meditate - sleep	"Hello all,

What an interesting and inspiring community!

I am starting with meditation (did it already long long time ago for about a week), and i have a main goal:

Every time i have a big event i get anxious and stressed, and mostly about the sleep i get the night before. This in turn keeps me awake, which is a vicious circle that i really hate. 

Examples: last year my birthday, i had to get up early and had a party in the evening. I got so stressed about my sleep (and the early waking) that i got kind off panic attacks about my sleep.

And now: next week i have a job interview (at 14.00h, so not even early). I already feel my stomach and chest stressing about the sleep (and NOT the interview). 

I know there are a lot of benifits in meditation, and not to speak less about allllll these benefits, but will mediation (and being more mindfull) help me with my main goal do you think?"

ScruffyWax	2021-04-02 06:19:49+00:00	"Struggling with self love, Meditation Frustration, seeking advice"	"I find it very difficult to accept my emotions, my dads side of the family has a history of mental illnesses so that passed over to me. Even on anxiety medication I still feel restless and uneasy, I struggle to cope with my anxiety even after regularly practicing meditation. I want to accept every aspect of myself but it’s difficult for me, I try to watch my thoughts but I can only do so for so long, my anxious thoughts don’t disappear they just get replaced by other depressive/anxious thoughts so watching them seems counterproductive imo. But I’m no meditation guru so what do I know? I don’t like watching thoughts because I never could get that feeling like I’ve separated myself from them, it still feels like I’m being brought down by them.

Even if I watch a thought til it disappears there’s a 70 percent chance they next thought will be negative. I KNOW that my thoughts aren’t factual but I still feel them as if they are. For example if I watch the thought “I’m so sad, why am I sad, why can’t I accept myself and give myself love?” Watching this thought doesn’t do anything and no matter how hard I try to be the observer of this thought I just can’t.

I just want to love myself and except my thoughts and emotions as they are, but no matter what I do I still don’t fully feel that love for myself."

So I’ve been meditating way more since quitting pot and I’m unsure if this is what happens to everyone who becomes enlightened? Is this how it happens, is it this intense? Or is frank yang just crazy? 

Also random question, I much prefer laying down and mediating which he also did during kundalini awakenings. Do I NEED to sit to have effective meditation? I’ve found some sold “breakthroughs” even lying down."

chocolate__crab	2021-04-02 04:59:18+00:00	Meditate like airborne fighter pilots during dogfighting!	"I read in a book that fighter pilots make fast and accurate decisions under such high g-forces with something called an 'OODA' loop. 
O - Observe
O - Orient
D - Decide
A - Act
(Repeat) 





I have experimented and come up with a similar cycle that keeps me tranquil and mindful during meditation. The results are mind-blowing. 


This loop also contains 4 elements whose execution is to be repeated sequentially.

1) Be aware of all thoughts.

Yet try to not get involved(dwell) in those thoughts. Do not judge those thoughts. Do not spend any intellectual resources on those thoughts. 



2) Regardless, If you do realize that you're dwelling or judging any thought(s), just distract yourself from it instantaneously and deliberately.

For helping the distraction process, you can momentarily open your eyes to see a candle or a wallpaper with white dot in a black background. If you don't have such physical distractions, you can simply ""visualise"" a white tiny dot floating in a dark background of space/nothingness. Whatever be the method of distraction, the objective here is to break the involvement with your thought(s).



3) Be aware of the relation between current thought, previous thought and the upcoming thought.

Most of the times, thoughts occur as a chain of ideas. Even if one thought pops up, out of nowhere, the next one might be related to the first one. Realizing the common attribute(s) of the consequent thoughts can help you better distract yourself from that chain of ideas. But I must caution you, do not spend too much of your intellectual efforts on this third element. Do not even dwell on it. For this is just a ¼ part of the loop that is to be repeated several times.



4) Discern meta-cognitive thoughts

This element is specifically dedicated to one peculiar type of thought. That's metacognition. There is good chance that you'll get involved in something called a feedback loop or ""thinking about thinking."" The last step of this loop is look out for any such thought processes going around and terminate them. Use the methods of distraction in element 2 if needed.



Now repeat this loop.


As hard and long the above might seem, it's just for explanatory and comprehensive purposes. But I execute each iteration of this loop in just a few seconds. With practice even you'll be able to. And the results will amaze you. I'm a 22 yo undergraduate student from India. Do write to me, if you need any further clarification on the above method.
Good luck and happy meditating!"
gwendolynrb	2021-04-02 04:23:16+00:00	How awareness brings growth (a thought process)	"Ive recently had a focus on just noticing and having an awareness around what the contents of my thoughts are... and Im developing a big fat crush on someone

so my thoughts have been a lot of fantasies and scenarios and its made me start to think about how being so infatuated with this person is a way for me to not experience reality to its fullest, a way for me to numb out essentially.

 And its quite interesting because now I am wondering why am I numbing out or a better question, what am i numbing out? 

I just moved across the country 2 months ago and I think Ive finally come face to face with the overbearing loneliness that comes with living alone for the first time and moving days away from all your family and friends.

and so ive delt with this loneliness by finding someone to obsess over and I can think and daydream of happy carefree fantasies with this person anytime I might feel lonely and then I dont have to acknowledge or experience these negative feelings. 

I dont know how im supposed to sit with this loneliness, I feel frustrated with myself and I feel lost and I dont know how to move forward. 

... in the past what ive done is given myself an intentionally emotional outlet, like making myself cry by listening to sad music. Im not sure if it helps, part of me thinks its just an excuse for me to ""be over and done with it"" like if I let myself experience the hurt for 15 minutes it will go away and stop hurting. 

on the bright side all this is a wonderful example of my growth, the fact that I can recognize whats happening instead of just deteriorating. 

I also worry that this might be a reoccurring theme in my life with my tendency to not stay too single for too long... is it all just a constant repression of a deep loneliness? and if thats the case, what can I do to help with this? how does one go about unlearning such a thing? 

I guess its to continue to catch myself in the act of these thoughts and patterns... and then to combat them, to do something else, to come back to the present moment. Stop the train in its tracks over and over again until it doesn't see the point in running anymore. and I guess thats growth."

After suffering with some insomnia and my usual nightly meditation/astral projection sessions were not helping, I decided to during the day have a session not in my usual place (front room) and blasted some meditation music through my surround sound system.    

The purpose of this sessions was to manifest abundance in wealth - specifically the Euro Millions £120 million Lottery Jackpot for today (and I absolutely and wholeheartedly believe I will become a millionaire when I play the lottery today) however during this meditation I astral projected a little (kind of teleported around the house in different seats in different rooms) and then all of a sudden I was swimming through the sea at speed. The water was gorgeously deep blue and I could see I was swimming with wild life. It cause I was travelling at speed it didn’t feel like I was human, as the ocean felt deep and vast yet we (myself and the other wildlife around me) was only a few feet from the surface. It’s was so beautiful and so real, I could even see the individual bubbles created through our powerful yet graceful movements through the waters. I also noticed it felt like as I was moving my head/vision was spearheading through the waters and my body was behind (at the back) kind of like a dolphin I suppose? This last about 5 seconds until it faded the I’d go back to being in some random part of my house and then it would fade back in after a few moments and this repeated about 5-10 times.       

It was a really profound experience and I’m trying to understand what it means! Does anybody have any ideas or similar experiences? I don’t believe it was me taking form of my spirit animal as I believe that Is a snake (I’ve had many dreams whereby I’m kind of slithering around like a snake) and when I walk in the dark I get worried that I’m constantly going to fall over and it’s like I constantly have a silver snake slithering around my ankles in a figure of 8.        

Really hope is don’t sound too out there as there experiences are very vivid! Any thoughts and guidance would be greatly appreciated!"

joestrwrs	2021-04-02 02:10:27+00:00	“Who am I?”	"When I was a kid, probably around age 9 or 10, I used to sometimes wonder very deeply about my mind. I distinctly recall thinking about thinking itself and my mind. And then I would wonder to myself, “wait, who am I? No, like who is asking that question? What is behind all of my movements?” And then I would look at my hands and move them and just observe in awe that I was making that happen. And then one time, while I was doing this, I suddenly entered into this spooky out-of-body type experience that made me feel disconnected with my body. I remember having a sense of “seeing” my body from above (though I wonder if this particular memory is a suggestive memory from years of TV and stories of these types of things). 

While this experience was going on, I remember hearing my dad’s voice in the other room and understanding that it was my dad, but in another way not really being familiar with it. And within a few seconds I would come back to reality, pretty shaken.

This intrigued me as much as it frightened me. And so I recall doing it intentionally a few times after that over the next few years. I could induce it by thinking (and maybe even saying) the question “who am I?” very intently and looking in the mirror as I did it. 

To me, this was always kind of my rosebud  - I would try to explain it to people over the years and they never really understood me. But it has fascinated and terrified me all of my life.

I have been getting into meditation and mindfulness practice recently and it seems like what I was doing was seeing the dissolution of the self. Transcending the self perhaps? In the Waking Up app, Sam Harris described an experience (perhaps quoting Harding’s the Man With No Head) that was eerily similar to what I remember.

What’s interesting to me is that I cannot and have not been able to “achieve” this since I was probably like 12. It may be of note that I started taking ADHD and SSRI medications around the time I used to have these experiences and have taken them all of my life since. So perhaps there is some barrier there.

But I just wanted to share this in case anyone else has had this experience."

"I’ve been trying to master the art of meditation for almost a year now. My biggest trouble is my mind always begins to wander and I lose my meditative state in only a few minutes. 

I’ve found what might be the perfect solution for my busy mind. Trataka Meditation. Focusing on the flame of a candle to promote concentration. This has worked wonderfully for me thus far! I often pair trataka meditation with certain frequencies or binaural beats playing in my headphones. I have never been able to successfully clear my mind for more than 5-10 min at time. With this method, I’ve found myself in a meditative state for 20-30 min. 

While gazing at the flame, I often see images. The most recent and most vivid image that appeared to me was an elephant standing in front of a giant “tree of life”. I’ve also seen butterflies, mountains and an image of what seemed to be someone waving at me. This immediately made me think of my grandmother and that perhaps she was saying hello.

I’m just curious what are the other benefits to meditation and basically what the goal is to meditation. I understand most of the goals will be set by what you want out of it but is the overall reason it was created to be more self aware or just to remove yourself from your ego?

"Sometimes after a meditation session my head feels very numb and sort of tingles around the cheekbones and middle of forehead, I don't do any sort of rapid breathing techniques; just a simple Vipassana meditation focusing on the breath.

RunningWithTheWind	2021-04-01 23:47:01+00:00	Man meditation has made life interesting	"I've been meditating daily and nearing a year of it in May. I've mainly did guided meditation at first. Then I started switching between om chanting and regular breathe focus practices. 

I've recently hit this point where it's like I keep seeing my thoughts and how the constantly try to me suffer. For example, I was at the doctor for oral surgery and was waiting for over 30 minutes inside without my phone. During this my mind would occasionally think angrily like ""what is taking so long! I want my phone. Ugh"". But it's like anything I would think that I would think notice and be like am I really causing my own suffering then just laugh. 

Stuff like that happens a lot now. It's funny because sometimes I won't be able to control a thought or emotion but I still feel the underlying feeling of ""don't create your own suffering"" but it's just to strong to completely control or stop, but it won't have much of a grip as it used to. Therefore, the emotion or thought fades away with much less effort than before. (Not saying I'm perfect now, because I definitely still lose temper and get caught in my emotion and thoughts still)

Honestly mediation has helped my life so much. I went from the classic lazy college student living at home to a person who has a strict schedule from 8am - 7pm. I think the biggest thing it taught me was that all value judgments people place aren't real, and is completely subjective . This is probably the knowledge that helped me be less attached to thoughts and feelings. Because while I still take them seriously and into consideration, I don't feel the weight of them controlling me as much."

Meditation for assessing and fixing problems in life.

_______

When you fight a monster do you run away? Not if you are to defeat that monster.

A mistake made is to find escape from the things that are issues. One of the uses, so commonly, of meditation is to run from life issues. Living in the moment. Even the desire to use meditation to create happiness. It is as a drug. Temporary.

Another less common use is to use meditation to analyse a problem. To really over think it. Find what ever detail that can change your opinion of the problem you find. One of the mysteries that meditation unfolds that a lot of people repeat is that a problem is found only in your head and not in reality. As an illusion.

But in reality that problem still exists. In reality that problem is in your head but it is also in your life. To meditation on life issues is to find the proper detail you need to change your situation. Often times it is a small detail of how you are thinking of the situation. That's where it is true that the problem is an illusion. But that still means you have to find that solution.

Because the problem is in your head and the only way to fix it is to fix your thought pattern.

Way of the rock. One never avoids an issue. One looks it directly in the eyes and makes it move like water around itself so the problem does not effect the one.

Meditate to fix your problems in life. Not to escape them."

But every time I meditate I start to cry. For instance just now I tried a mindfulness meditation on headspace and it asked me to picture myself and someone I loved feeling relaxed. So naturally I pictured me and my husband on the beautiful Cabo beach we went to for vacation a couple years ago. And I just started crying because I kept thinking about how I can never feel like that again or maybe even never be able to travel again. 

Every attempt I make to meditation goes like this. I either feel more anxious or more sad.

I lay in the tub with my legs crossed and let my arms just float to the surface - I focus on my chest breathing and keep my ears just below the water. Today I decided to meditate with my eyes opened looking up towards the showerhead. About 10 minutes in I was very relaxed and doing a good job focusing on my breaths when I started to notice green waves of color glide across my field of vision.

tstaffordson	2021-04-01 20:18:53+00:00	Loving Kindness- sharing my experience from my session today.	"Something amazing happened in my practice today.  I feel compelled to share.

This afternoon, instead of doing my usual mindfulness meditation, I decided to branch out and try to add some variety to my routine.  Using a meditation app (Medito) I randomly selected a Loving Kindness session by Giovanni Dienstmann.  In this session, the whole focus was on cultivating and fully immersing one's self in Loving Kindness.  

It wasn't my first experience with a loving-kindness session, but it was the first time I was able to fully connect with and feel what I will have to describe as pure, unconditional love for myself.  

In the \~13 minutes I was sitting, I laughed, I cried, I felt physical sensations of near ecstasy and catharsis.  It was one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had (period). Long-suppressed memories of first loves and remembered moments of joy came rushing back in waves.  They reminded me, that I wasn't always so closed off and guarded... that I wasn't always afraid to express love or to fully love myself.  It made me realize just how much I have hidden from my own view out of some fear of being too vulnerable and just how amazing and powerful love truly is.

Anyway, thank you all for allowing me to share... I hope it helps someone else out there, who like me, is just trying to figure it all out.

**I'd love to hear from all of you about any similar or related experiences.**

As for me,  I am going to go kiss my wife and child and then call my Mom.

Much Love!

*\*Addendum:  I don't know if I can credit my experience to a single app, guide, or session.  I am certainly not trying to sell or promote anything here... I did want to relay important details, just in case, they might be a help to others.  My experience is likely a result of many factors including my years-long journey exploring meditation and mindfulness practice.*"

donutsilovedonuts	2021-04-01 18:40:25+00:00	"Working with ""insistent visitors"" and strong urges"	"I've been dealing with a very specific, and extremely insistent, set of stories/feelings for about two and a half years at this point. It manifests as a particular urge to reach out to / be in relationship with a person I knew from a few years ago. This experience continues despite the fact that I actually already semi-dated this person for two months, before breaking it off due to lack of positive investment in the relationship. Anyway, I've done a lot of work with this pattern, trying to get underneath it to find an emotional driver underneath, and have definitely made some progress in feeling some of the old developmental trauma that relates to it, as well as problems in other relationships. Nonetheless the pattern persists. I found [Jack Kornfield's article](https://jackkornfield.com/expand-field-attention/) about ""insistent visitors"" and repetitive thoughts to be quite helpful here, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of any related articles I could look at. In general, anyone who has had related experiences can feel free to chime in with this. I've been feeling very stuck lately, and have been unsure whether I just need to reach out to this person again, or whether that story is mostly a distraction from a deeper underlying issue at play."

swisstrip	2021-04-01 16:59:02+00:00	Meditation Practice Problems	"Let me start by saying that the discovery of meditation using the WakingUp app is one of the best and most important discoveries I made in a long time. I even rate this discovery amongst the most important things I have ever done or experienced (this includes my acid experiences and my coming out).

I have come into this with a more than skeptical mind, but once I tried the first few sessions of the introductory course of the app, it took only a few days until I realized that the practice already started to have some impact on my perception and getting some mindful moments throughout the days was often as easy as taking a single deep breath. 

For the next week or so the effects, like being more equanimous, less reactive and being more present in the current moment became even more noticeable. I have become deeply fascinated by this technique. Even my partner mentioned that he feels like having a transformed and kind of new person in front of him. For me, the situation was pure bliss and the feelings that went with it were rather euphoric.

Unfortunately, this state of mind did not persist. As the introductory course progressed and I also tried to do some additional meditation sessions in between, I realized that it got harder and harder to become or stay attentive and to dive in. Also, the moments where I was able to bring mindfulness into normal life got less common and even when it worked it had little effect. After another few days I realized that I am basically back to my old, mainly reactive, instead of mindful mode of operation. The only thing that stopped me of abandoning the mediation project out of frustration and anger (this gave me some sleepless nights) was the previous experience that the technique works and that there is something worth exploring.

What am I doing wrong? 

I guess I strive and want to much, which blocks me of letting go and becoming aware of the present moment. Are any ways, techniques or recommendation, how to overcome this obstacle so I can dive in again?

It is clear to me that other meditation novices must have made similar experiences. When I did a little research on how to move forward, I didn’t find much of help apart from the recommendation to let go and strive less, but the question how to actually do this remained unanswered. Therefore some down to earth advice on how to move forward would be highly appreciated."

iamnoteurydice	2021-04-01 12:56:31+00:00	Please help me from losing myself	"I've been trying to perform the Jyoti tratak for 2 years. I do it for the first 5/6 days of the month and fail to be consistent and the same thing repeats every month. Right now I'm in such a low state of my life. I'm failing academics so badly. My mind is so distracted. I can't control myself from talking to toxic online guys. I'm constantly seeking attention and validation from them. I know I don't love them and I know they don't care for me but despite knowing this I just can't control myself from chatting and wasting time on them. For the past 5 years, I did that way too much and somehow this may be the main reason for me to master the art of distraction. I really can't concentrate on anything. Even if I'm not talking to any guys and I've no problem in my life I actually cannot concentrate on my studies. I just can't focus. I am no more that small girl who used to wake up at sharp 4 am and dive into her books. I lost that spark and nothing has hurt me more than this.

I came to know about tratak and in some article, they say tratak works wonder to increase concentration and has many more benefits other than just developing concentration. In one of them, I read that it even helps to improve eyesight naturally. I'm suffering from short-sightedness so is this true that tratak can get me rid of these boring glasses? 

And does tratak works as they said? If yes then how do I stick myself to perform it on regular basis? And if no what are other forms of meditation which will help me to stay focused and be that little girl again?"

Jax_Gatsby	2021-04-01 10:48:04+00:00	Love and attachment aren't the same thing.	"Most people confuse attachment and lust with love, I've even heard some people say if you're not attached to a person then you can't love them. But the truth is as long as attachment is there, you can't love. With attachment comes fear, jealousy (which is a form of fear), possessiveness and other unpleasant things that ruin relationships.  Real love doesn't ask to be loved back because then it becomes a transaction, but people only love people who love them back and this isn't love.

As long as there is fear (which includes attachment and so on) and expectations, there can't be love because the two cannot co-exist. Things like fear and attachment are of the ego, and the ego cannot love because it is unconscious and self-centred, and a self-centred person can't love. Attachment and love are like darkness and light; when darkness is there, light isn't and vice versa.

I'll leave you with this quote:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*You better be aware when anybody says they love you. What they really mean is jealousy, control, attachment, expectations and more.* \- From a song called ['How It Is'.](https://open.spotify.com/track/7Dxe5lU4Yno7wav43xiTKk?si=9e82274e3ffb4089)"

My personal experience has not been good, though. If I continue, I think I just need a completely new approach or mindset. I feel like I have made zero progress in 2+ years, I'm just as bad as someone meditating for the very first time every time I meditate. I have not improved at all. I've never enjoyed meditating, and I don't feel like my mindset, attitude, or outlook has shifted since I started. I look at meditation as exercise, much like going to the gym, something I force myself to do, but something that I dislike. I get really frustrated that I can't grasp any of the concepts that are being taught during guided meditations, I just feel so lost in all of it, that I don't understand any of it. I can't focus for more than 10 seconds on any one thing, so it's all frustrating instead of calming.

Sandycastles	2021-04-01 03:44:04+00:00	"Question on Judgement of Information, Yourself, and Others"	"Dear Cass,

Could you write one on judgment?

Thanks,

\~

Hey \~,

That is a very vague question so I will give you an interpretation on it. There are two sides to judgement: there is your own judgement of your perception of reality and there is other people's judgement of you.

Let me begin with the question: How can I trust my own judgement? This is a very good and difficult question to tackle, after all, our judgement of the world around us, of right and wrong, of true and false is just a combination of all the events and information we have been exposed to throughout the course of our lives. So when questioning your own judgement of the world around you, it's best to stick to the easy to prove. If your gut reaction to a statement is that it doesn't seem true, then the best next step is to **do your research** and I don't mean reading the headlines of popular articles, I mean look at a few different reputable sources that are written by people with real credentials. If you are going to pass judgement on information, at least have an informed opinion on the topic.

If you have fears, for example, about if getting the COVID vaccine is safe or if any vaccine is safe, please do not just look at facebook pages for research. Look to scientists, scientific publications, the CDC. Maybe look into what goes into the vaccine and how it works. You can even find first person accounts from people who received the vaccine, even people who received the vaccine during it's first couple months of human trials. Once you look at the peer reviewed articles then you can revisit what you want to do about the vaccinations.

What about if you find yourself judging other people? Again, look at what you can prove. Has this person hurt you in any way? Has this person made your life more difficult? Does this person even affect your life at all? If you are judging people from a far that will never touch your life, then it is most likely a waste of time. That person can be wrong if they want and it probably not worth expending so much energy on someone you will never meet and has no power over your life. Also, before you work yourself up thinking about how much this person might suck, remember that even if the have harmed you, they may not have realized it. There are two sides of every story and if you find yourself judging someone else for their opinions, behavior, or actions try to understand why they may be doing and saying these things. Most of the time if someone is spreading misinformation it is because they were taught that same misinformation and to them they are doing the right thing. If someone is being inconsiderate, it is usually because they have suffered some adversity whether it was that day, long ago, or even a childhood trauma.

It may be still be frustrating that the person who is bugging you doesn't seem interested in tackling the root of the problem with introspection and/or therapy, but unfortunately we can not force others to improve themselves, they have to want self-improvement on their own. The best we can do for the people who wrong us is to be a good example of calmness and love. It reminds me of a quote from one of my favorite actors, Bill Murray. He says ""The more relaxed you are, the **better** you are at **everything**: the **better** you are with your loved ones, the **better** you are with your enemies, the **better** you are at your job, the **better** you are with yourself."" It is ok to judge others for their choices, but right after you judge them, you should follow it up with compassion and love.

In a quick example, ""I hate my neighbors, they are always playing music too loud, too late in the night! "" ""maybe they don't know how loud it is from my side"" ""It is nice that they are enjoying their music."" ""Maybe I should just let them know that it is keeping me from getting to sleep on time."" .....Unfortunately this is really all you can do, at least this scenario ends with a potential solution instead of a brooding and growing anger. Maybe you do let them know that it is a nuisance and they reign it in and you find compromise and maybe even become friends. Maybe they are total d bags and they decide they don't care what you think and play their music louder to spite you. If that is the case you will have to talk to your landlord, apartment manager, or the police, but at least you didn't jump to conclusions before trying to communicate with them.

In a quick example, ""I hate my neighbors, they are always playing music too loud, too late in the night! "" ""maybe they don't know how loud it is from my side"" ""It is nice that they are enjoying their music."" ""Maybe I should just let them know that it is keeping me from getting to sleep on time."" .....Unfortunately this is really all you can do, at least this scenario ends with a potential solution instead of a brooding and growing anger.

If that is the case, you will have to talk to your landlord, apartment manager, or the police, but at least you didn't jump to conclusions before trying to communicate with them.

The final part of this contemplation of judgement to cover is other people's judgement of you. This can be daunting, I still find myself experiencing anxiety about cooking in my kitchen because I am afraid of being judged by my roommate. Just like in the last scenario, judgement goes both ways. You may know your own story, but you most like don't know the story of those who are judging you. When those harsh critics gave me extremely rough reviews on this blog and this cult, I was really hurt and it was really difficult not to react emotionally. I gave it some time and I now realize that they didn't know me or my reason for starting this community. To them they were putting a stop to a sinister cult during it's infancy. To them it was a open and shut case that no cult could ever be positive and they could anonymously put a stop to it before it ever grew. To them, they had a chance to stop a possible future Hitler before he grew into a monster, and I can't be mad at them for that.

Maybe those people judging you think that you are something you are not. Most judgements are quick and not based on the whole picture. Someone can think you are messy or a bad student without realizing that you are working three jobs and barely have time to take care of yourself, let alone tidy up. Someone can think you're slutty without knowing that you are actually a virgin. When worried about other's judgements of you, just remember that if they are judging you they probably don't know you, and if they know you they probably wouldn't pass negative judgement on you, and if they know you well and still think you suck, then maybe they have something they need to work on in their own lives. At the end of the day it is not the judgement that matters, its the truth and the communication of that truth that matters.

I hope this was along of the lines of what you were looking for \~. I pontificated on judgement the best I could tonight, Please feel free to ask a more targeted version of the question if I missed the mark.

In the meantime you are doing great on you journey. I am so proud of you for all the good you do.

I love you,

Cass."

whatevergotlaid	2021-04-01 01:43:35+00:00	PSA - The direct path is available right now to anybody and many of you are ready for it.	"You don't need to spend 20 years meditating to awaken to the illusion. Meditation is still useful after awakening, to observe and undo the past conditioning. But the truth is here right now for you to know, and I believe that by feeding it to you in pieces and analogies and practices, some of you aren't being given the full prescription right away and many of you can handle it. So here is my attempt to at least enlighten a few of you. I hope somebody gets something from this, at the very least.   
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The truth is, there is no self, and there is no awareness. You can't describe either of them to me. Anything you describe, will be some form of experienced *Qualia*.   


All there is, is *Qualia. or experience. or consciousness.* or whatever the hell you want to call it.

The self is built from the Qualia and feels as though it were a free agent. It's just a concept made by the mind. The mind is also *just* experienced Qualia.  


Everything you see, hear, touch, smell, think, feel, know; is happening in your mind. None of it is happening in ""the world"". The experience you are having *is the contents of your mind*. It is a type of virtual reality, representing some objective reality that is never truly known.   


Anything you are calling a self, any feeling, explanation, thought - ANYTHING you can point to, is *just another Qualia appearing in the mind*.  


This is the stream of consciousness. There is nothing outside of it, nothing to witness it, to watch it, to observe it. There is no self, and there is other self you call *awareness*. Awareness is just where we tell people to look to dissolve the mind made self. **There is** ***nothing*** **but Qualia.** This is nonduality. Not two. Everything is one. There is no subject to the object. Just the object."

I wanted to free myself once and for all.  I wasnt suicidal, i only intended to face and transcend death. If anybody else understands what i mean.

I was in so much love, faith and  courage prior to it. But I was unable to pass through. I feel so disoriented after what i did.

I was wrong how i rushed myself again.  And hence i feel so tired again.  Im unable to keep still and continue.  So many thoughts and emotions went loose from hell. 

Its so hard to walk alone.   I still havent gotten used to it.  I miss my best friend who regulalry leads me through scriptural studies which had been most effective for me to still my mind and keep my calm.  He also guided me through heart meditation. We also do Tai Chi together.

I miss having a dadah (daddy) I can call when I feel so troubled. He's a kid much younger but I have come to respect him as higher than me like a father.  But we fell apart since I felt unsafe with his new  grp and leader.

I have given up spiritual practice ever since I had no one guiding me.  I had been afraid to meditate and take it seriously since its been getting too dark and unmanageable on my own. I quit it years ago with a promise to get back only once a guru comes to me.

I recently got back when someone saw my potential and started helping me.  But i feel bad how he just tells me to stop talking as its just of the mind.  Damn how he just wanna do all the talking but have no ears.  

Damn how tiring it is how im not allowed to be human and to be a woman and to need to talk.  I wasnt even talking to him but just looking for someone to talk with. 

Damn how he demonizes the mind.  Damn all the mindlessness. Damn too all his heartlessness.

Damn how he starts off an arguement and criticizing me after I just agree with what he said.  Damn all that unnecessary pressure and discipline. 

Damn how he stirs me into love and then had to discipline me for how I love him.  I wasnt even being indecent. I was more of just expressing kind words of gratitude, transmuting the love into a higher form.  I didnt even  allow myself to flirt and attract him. 

 Damn how I only requested him not to use examples/wordings that paints a picture of being together romantically... that was all the discipline i requested on his part so that i can continue to learn from him and not  have to leave and avoid him.  But then he start to just push me away farther and avoids talking altogether.  

Damn how he messes with my heart. And then tells me to use the heart than the mind.  Damn how he cant see talking as a portal through the heart too.  And damn how I cant use my heart coz I cant be allowed to love.

Damn his method how he intentionally provokes. Damn how he says he enjoys all but lacks concerns in how the other person gets affected.  Damn all the advanced stuff just too soon for me to ponder and delve into.  

Damn how I had been on a haste to awaken and transcend time, life, and death.  Damn how I wanted to be free to love and be loved with him. Damn how I so much wanted to manifest my true self and satisfy him with all i am. VDamn how I havent before ever had a desire this deep, beyond mind and body, and yet I am so soon giving up fo he way he is, my mind just cant really like him. Damn I didnt even really like him before except by  some occult  perhaps he did.  Damn how he has many girlfriends.

Damn this love.  Damn this heart. Damn how I cant love him.  Damn how he says he loves me but doesnt love me.  Damn how I cant  even have a mind after I have lost my  heart already.  Damn why do i even have a body.

  I just miss my dadah.  How can I find a guide like my dadah. Someone who can amaze me as much and earn my respect and trust for his character and way of communicating. Someone who really teaches well and who's words bring clarity and calm rather than confusion. Someone with a real heart and tender kindness and care. 

Someone too who'd not mess with my heart unless he really means to love me.

Damn Im so tired of seeking God/Truth/Self or whatever.  And yet my life has  been all about that.  Im devoid of everything else. Im powerless without spirituality and having to meditate. But it just so tiring to walk alone.  And all the more to walk with someone who has no real love and respect for  humanity, just so full of himself."
P0ng-Wh1ffy	2021-04-01 00:04:50+00:00	Smaller. Deeper.	"Hey y’all!

So, I’m relatively new to this wonderful practice that we all are bonded by. I’ve been setting aside about 15 minutes a day for the past 2-3 weeks to sit, and it’s been marvellous. 

Truly. A life changer. I experienced something interesting— to me at least, as a newbie!— and I wanted to share it with this great like-mind for your thoughts, opinions, encouragements, admonishments— whatsoever you feel. 

I had arranged myself comfortably, and begin settling in to the practice. I began to watch my breath, first with a count for some while, and then I let go the count and stayed with the sensation of the breath. Then I felt something unusual that I hadn’t felt before, at first my natural reaction was fear of some kind. Not terror or the need for flight from it, but just a kind of trepidation, but I managed to let go of that and I sat in that sensation for a while. It was weird, but enjoyable. The only way I can describe it is in the title— I felt this sensation of becoming smaller, that was the weirdest thing, and then a more familiar feeling, I guess, of going deeper, like I’d fallen in to something. Smaller and deeper is how I felt. It was bizarre. 

Anyhow, just wanted to share, and wondered if other practitioners had experienced similar things. I’d love to hear about your experiences, too!

So, I just experienced this new thing and I wanted to share it with you. You can share your experience as well, it got me really curious.

I practiced for 15 minutes today but I was feeling my body really tense and my mind couldn't keep up the focus anymore, so I just finished the practice and sat on the bed to have some tea. There was a candle lit just in front of me. I decided to glaze at it while having my tea, and it was really fun actually, the flame was dancing so softly and it was even following a movement pattern. 

But then after a few seconds looking at it I decided to close my eyes, and then a reeeallyyyyy intense orange circle appeared in my vision, very solid and very still, perfectly delimited. And the more I focused on it, the more intense it would get. There was a point when I couldn't take the intensity of it and suddenly opened my eyes, feeling curiosity but also a little bit frightened (not exactly this but anyway). Can I do this as a daily practice? Is this ""frightening"" common? It was really unexpected...

Please, share your experiences with candle glazing! I got really curious about it and want to know more, and if there is anything that talks about it, it would be highly appreciated.

Stay safe and keep up with your practice."

personne1-1	2021-03-31 21:09:19+00:00	Not sure how to best move forward with my current practice following TMI	" 

I have only been doing daily meditation for 2 months and slowly moved from 10 mins to 25 mins.

I thought by now I would be in stage 2-3 of The Mind Illuminated book but I have found myself experiencing what googling has led me to believe may be Jhanas(whole body Jhana).

During meditation today, I experienced a lot of shaking and bouncing that basically moved me to about 6 inches in front of my cushion to the floor. The past 5 days' meditations have been lesser variations of this( the day before almost having an ""O"" which I stopped because I thought it was weird and something I had never expected to experience, this happened after following the pleasure sensation in my lower belly, and the day before that, dizziness/tipsiness after following pleasure on top of my head).

I am usually there after I have basically spent about 5+ minutes of no distraction and full attention and alertness on nose sensations and once I can't feel sensations on my nose any longer ( very shallow breathing), I do a body scan and that's when I find these ""spots of pleasure"". Book wise, I am just beginning reading on the third stage since, I had imagined that this is where I would be after this time and didn't want to read too much in advance.

So, since I don't know what I am doing( when it comes to scanning the body and those strange events) and haven't read or researched enough, should I stop my body scans, which are what's leading to the shaking or should I just let myself keep experiencing the shakes and continue to read TMI as planned. I am mostly trying to avoid doing something detrimental to my body and mental health( I have very briefly read stuff about the dark night and people basically spending months bedridden because of meditation and I want to be careful with my practice."
Southern_Type_6194	2021-03-31 20:31:39+00:00	Restart Day 1	"While I've been great at keeping up with my meditation practice...I have not been great at tracking my sitting time on here. So here's a fresh start!

I typically like guided meditations, but the past two days I knew I just needed to sit in stillness based on how much I didn't want to. One of the big things I've learned in my 32 years is sitting in stillness with your shitty feelings helps you move through them more quickly than simply wallowing or keeping busy to avoid them. Neither is healthy and they'll come to the surface eventually anyways.

I've been feeling a lot of sadness over the loss of what could only be described as a situationship. Yesterday and today I pulled out my meditation pillow, lit my favorite candle, and made myself sit in stillness while just listening to my breath go in and out and just feel my feels. 

As the time ticked away I could feel the sadness and anxiety draining away leaving my core self behind. I was filled with gratitude and love for myself.

3 Reasons I'm Grateful:

* I just signed up to take psych stats which is a prerequisite for me to apply for my master's in counseling. I had to continually put this off due to chronic pain issues that have since been resolved.
* I put myself out there with the guy I was in the situationship with and I was vulnerable. It takes a lot of bravery to open your heart up and be vulnerable with another human. Especially when it involves romantic feelings. I ended up getting rejected and that really sucks, but I'm proud of myself for being vulnerable and willing to risk getting hurt. You'll never get anything you want if you aren't willing to risk things not going your way. 
* I'm grateful because I know that even though I wasn't what he wanted, and he ended up ghosting me, I'm still fucking awesome. I like myself and I'm rad. I'll find someone who's even better and thinks I'm worth going the distance for."
voboda_	2021-03-31 19:48:58+00:00	"Do thoughts follow intention, or intentions come from thoughts?"	"Been meditating daily for almost a year now, and started to notice something about my daily life.  When I get interrupted by something nice, I consider it a distraction and get annoyed.  Why?

I started to observe thoughts and intentions. If intention comes from thought, then I could think up new intentions to replace the old ones, but I found deeper intentions stayed as they are.  My thoughts were almost always rationalizations, interpretations or analysis of things I already wanted to do.

I can't say where my intentions come from (yet) but I do notice them more, and notice how they affect my mood and what I think about.  This helps me understand what I want more, and is kind of freeing.  Just wanted to share that.  Something maybe you've already experienced?

It's hard to get distracted by your thoughts when there is fresh air and so many natural sounds and feelings in the present to focus on. My best and longest meditations have in all cases been outside.

On the other hand, being inside has an uncanny amount of quietness and stillness. Lately, I've been having trouble not being overrun by thoughts while meditating inside. (Perhaps more so because of how much of my life has been confined to the inside). I would even much rather tolerate chilly weather outside than be warm inside.

That's why I look forward to the good weather, not simply because of the positive feelings associated with it, but also because it makes my meditation multitudes better.

Anyone else feel this way?"
panicsnac	2021-03-31 18:27:46+00:00	Using the stopwatch instead of a timer.	"There was a post here by someone a few days back about this, which I can’t seem to find. I just want to thank him/her for it. 

I’m a newbie at meditation and I was timing my sessions everyday until I tried using the stopwatch instead. 

A few things changed :
1. I was much more mindful of my breathing instead of thinking about when my phone was going to ring. I am comfortable with however less I had meditated because I’m confident I’m being more focused which is more important. 

2. I don’t think of it as ‘having to’ meditate for whatever time I am currently practising. Instead, it’s leaning more towards ‘wanting to’. 

3. Some days I just don’t feel like meditating, but in order to stay consistent I just sit for 2-3 minutes instead of guilty for not continuing my regular time durations. 

Overall, I think I’m getting the essence of it better now in terms if the duration not mattering but the focus and mindfulness. I’ve noticed that time passes faster than I expect when I’m not thinking about the phone ringing when the timer is up. 

I don’t really know if this will help anyone. Just sharing my experience. Thanks for reading and thanks again to the person who suggested this hack!"
saladios	2021-03-31 18:16:56+00:00	Massive Lump In Throat While Meditating?	"Hi! I’m very new to this sub &amp; very new to meditation. I’ve always loved the idea of meditating but I never thought I’d have time to actually do it! Thankfully I watched a lot of videos / read articles to guide me on how to meditate but I never saw or read what I just experienced. 

I normally meditate after I work out, it’s normally when I am at peace and when I feel calm and nice (even if my heart rate is going crazy). These past few weeks have been a very hard time on me and my overall health in general. Specifically my mother, she has not been the best at all and I unfortunately am stuck on what I should do.

Today I specifically meditating on that, like I thought and tried to help myself find the peace within the problems with my mother. I stopped though when I actually pictured my mom and I got a massive lump in my throat and just... puked. I ran to the bathroom and puked. I hadn’t even eaten breakfast but heck, I still puked. 

Has that ever happened to anyone? I’m sorry if this doesn’t belong here but I just don’t know if this means anything or if i’m like overreacting..

And if it has happened to someone, what did you do?? 

I can answer any other questions and would appreciate the help! Thank you so much!"

In the last year alone, she broke her wrist falling from her scooter, broke her foot on a trampoline, had such bad road rash from tripping in the parking lot at school that a doctor had to remove the rocks from her hands and knees, and just this week she was hit in the face with a softball (no broken nose but it did bleed for over an hour).  She has a face guard for softball but forgot it at home.  This is in addition to the typical childhood scrapes, bruises, rashes, etc that happen nearly constantly.  Medically she has VERY mild asthma but is quite healthy.  


She doesn’t always pay as much attention as she should to what she is doing, so I’m working with her on mindfulness and “being mentally present,” but it doesn’t seem to working.  

How can I keep this kid safer while letting her stay active?? She has (and except for this week’s softball incident, wears) all safety gear."
msira	2021-04-30 18:24:35+00:00	Parents who live in high rise buildings	"My husband and I have been contemplating on moving out of our current, single family rental which is 5,000 ft to moving into a high-rise building that has a lot of amenities and conveniences (still spacious, around 3,000sq ft). This is purely for the fun of it, because there is a lack of inventory of what we’re looking for in our area to buy (waterfront in Seattle, more specifically on Lake Washington). The building that we are considering is close to many restaurants and parks but I am worried that I’ll miss living in a single-family home even though this would not be permanent. 

Most importantly, I’m wondering if this living situation would be a good fit for a family, given that we have an almost 3yr old and a large dog. So for parents who may have experienced one or both, what are your thoughts? Did your family, especially kids, prefer one or the other? What were the challenges?"

My gf always gets up to get her, but i try to let her know that she needs to learn to self soothe but she isn’t responsive to it. Saying she does not want our baby to hyperventilate or be in distress (which is bs in my opinion). She doesn’t cry hard, it’s more like a ‘come get me’ cry nor  hunger cry or anything like that.

SadYogiSmiles	2021-04-30 17:59:18+00:00	7yo talking about “fat thighs.” Need help with appropriate response and learning resources	"Yesterday my boyfriends 7yo asked me if she had “fat thighs.” This is the first time I’d heard her ask about herself like that or use that type of language. I don’t want her to have a negative body image.

We asked her if someone said that or if she heard it from somewhere and she says she “made it up” which I don’t know if I believe, but it’s not a huge deal.

I’d love any advice you have on navigating this topic, or maybe some books that you think could resonate? I just know how much I struggled with poor self image and how much it negatively affected me and I don’t want that for her.

She doesn’t have access to social media or the internet without parental guidance FYI. And she is a very healthy weight for her age and size. My boyfriend will discuss the nutritious ness of foods with his kids but we don’t really discuss calories. I don’t shittalk my own body around them ever. 

When she asked the question I responded first by saying that no, she doesn’t have fat thighs. Then I followed up by saying having fat thighs isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I was wearing shorts so I did a little jiggle and said I have fat on my thighs and I think they’re wonderful.

Thanks!

Tl;dr: 7 y/o asked if she had fat thighs and I’d like advice on navigating this topic, including good books we could read together."

Note: The point of this point isn’t to criticize my parents, I know they did the best they could given the circumstances, and I’m now a mom to a beautiful 7 year old boy myself.. so I am writing this from a parental perspective as well.

1. Teach your children (able-bodied or not), that every child is different in their own unique way.  Focus on acceptance instead on hoping for a “cure,” because the “cure” mentality often displayed by my parents and those around me, always made me feel like I was fundamentally broken. There’s a kids book by Sonia Sotomayor called “Just Ask! Be different, Be you.” It talks about the different ways that disabilities impact children, and how some are visible and others are not (ADHD, autism, deafness, etc). It’s a great book, in my opinion. 

Try not to be so pessimistic about your child’s condition, this doesn’t mean pretend like they don’t have cp,  let them know that CP is PART of them, but it’s not ALL of them, and it doesn’t have to define them. focus on acceptance  and highlight their strengths. 

2. research the type of CP your child has has, so that you can explain it to them and they can explain it to others,  for example.. did you know that children with CP tend to get startled more easier than their peers? I’m super jumpy and didn’t know this was related to CP until recently. I also have a poor sense of direction and tend to get lost easily.  Find out as much about their condition as you can, knowledge is power.. 

Growing up, I was constantly bullied in school for walking with a limp due to cp.. and kids (and even adults at times) asked me what was “wrong with my leg” or why I “walked funny”.. and I never knew what to say or how to react.. if I’d known more about my condition, I wouldn’t have felt so helpless or been so down on myself. I would have been able to explain to others what my condition is and how it affects me, and it would’ve made a world of difference.

3. Make sure your child receives any accommodations he or she needs in school. Ask them how their day at school was and if they’re struggling with anything in particular. CP affects us In so many ways than just what’s physically obvious... for example, I find that it takes me a while to Sort through my thoughts and get my ideas down on paper when writing an essay.. but as A child, I was too timid to advocate for myself, so didn’t get extra time on tests  and writing exercises til I was an adult in college, I also started to voice record lectures so I could go over them slowly on my own time... little things like these also make a huge difference. 

4. Teach them self-advocacy skills. Your child may also be too shy or afraid to ask for extra help, so you have to be their advocate.. but also teach them self-advocacy skills along the way. Make sure they know it’s ok to ask for help, it’s ok to ask for more time, etc..

5. Counseling would have also been helpful growing up, to help me accept my condition and be comfortable in my own skin, and teach adequate coping skills (learning to self advocate, voice my needs, be more assertive, how to deal with bullying, etc...)

6. Never underestimate, shelter or stop your child from trying something new. Tell them that they can do anything they put their mind to, even if they might need some extra help sometimes or some accommodations along the way.

I know that cp is different for every child, and some are much more affected cognitively and physically than others.. but the point is to approach the condition in a more positive manner, from a place of acceptance.
I have a much more positive self-image now than I did as a child.. but this is because I took the time to seek help (psychotherapy and medication) as an adult. I have anxiety and depression, and much of my issues stem from the way that having a disability was stigmatized and always viewed in a negative light.. as something that was “wrong” with me, instead of something thats just part of me. 

If they have social media, have them follow others who have thrived despite advertisities.. I’ve come across surfers, body trainers, therapists, actors, etc.. who have cp or similar conditions. It helps to know that you’re not alone and that there are others out there with your conditions who have thrived. Here are a few that I can think of off the top of my head:

Pronetoride on FB and IG (surfer with cp)
@realchelseabear on IG (disability advocate with cp)
@chrisruden on Instagram (powerlifter and model)
And the list goes on..

I also have an IG/YouTube channel where I teach people graphic design, cricut tutorials, how to make custom Tshirts, etc. it’s mostly voiceovers, but feel free to check it out if you’re interested (@NhelyDesigns)

I’m now a senior in college working toward my degree in communication sciences and disorders, to become a speech therapist (with a minor in psychology), and I’m able to see my disability in a much more positive light, but this took A LOT of reframing and conscious effort on my part (still a work in progress). Reframing the way you and others around you view and talk about disability (shifting toward a culture of acceptance) will ultimately help your child be more comfortable and accepting of his or herself."
DAmazingBlunderWoman	2021-04-30 17:35:39+00:00	Craniosynostosis and speech delay	"So my boy was born with a metopic craniosynostosis and underwent a cranial vault remodeling surgery at 13 months.
He's now a healthy 18month old. 

However i'm afraid he might have a speech delay. He's just not picking up any new words. He only uses about three words he picked up before he was one - mama, tata, ""no"" (we're not from an english speaking country). He seems to understand a great deal more - brings his shoes when we're talking about going to the playground, brings his books when i say i want to read him a story, points to things knows his way around a cell phone etc.

Any other parents dealing with speech delay in their child? How do you approach something like that? What can I do to help my son?"
Two_drei_cuatro	2021-04-30 16:54:04+00:00	I volunteered to coach T-Ball for Five year olds	"I was terrified out of my mind. I haven't played baseball since middle school. All those parents looking at me from the benches, watching me interact with their sincerely beloved children.   
I DONT KNOW WHAT I'MDOING!! When I was a kid, I thought adults had it all figured out. I thought they had plans, or at least a general direction. Nope. Adults just wing it.   


I'm not good at baseball, I'm not good at sports. I can't even remember where the players all stand on the field. I haven't played baseball in twenty-five years!! You know what I am good at thought? Being silly with little kids, and pumping them up with positive words. So I fell back on that, and acted silly with them, got them to laugh. Then I pumped them full of 'good jobs' and 'way to go!'. They couldn't see my smile, or could I see their smiles due to mask requirements out in the field, but I could see it in their eyes. Want to do some silly stretches and pretend like we're rocket ships? okay! Lets do it!!  


I did this crazy thing because no one else wanted to, and they were going to cancel the season if they didn't get more coaches. I couldn't do that to my son, who wanted to play, so I volunteered.   


Thank goodness I got paired with someone who at least remembers some basics, but she was just as afraid.

"We have a relative who isn’t doing very well, we were supposed to visit last year and obviously that trip got cancelled. We don’t know how much time this relative has left and so I’m looking at travel dates right when school lets out. 
I’m still not comfortable with traveling at the moment but we don’t really have a choice in this situation and now it’s just deciding what is the best option. Flying would take two flights at two hours each to arrive and I would obviously have my child double mask, maybe even use a face shield on top of that. Driving will take 26 hours. 
I’ve made a list of pros and cons but I still can’t decide what would be safest. I’m fully vaccinated as is the family we’re visiting so I’m not concerned about once we’re there. Has anyone made a trip like this and what are some tips or suggestions you could pass along? Thanks in advance."
Momcantsleepthesaga	2021-04-30 16:48:52+00:00	Dad and I do not agree on how to parent!	"Before I start I just want to say that before we had a child I had similar parenting beliefs as him. Also I'm on mobile so excuse formatting. 


My husband and I have a 3 year old daughter. She is an absolute firecracker like I'm sure most 3 year olds are. 
Before she was born I was pro-spanking. It's how I was raised and I was in the mindset that it helps make better humans. But the first time I felt she needed any sort of discipline was when she was about 1.5 and starting hitting me a lot. My mom kept saying just give her a light smack on the butt and she will learn. But I kept thinking that it made zero sense to hit her for hitting me. I decided I wanted to follow a more gentle parenting approach. Time outs and discussions are my main things now. When shes older we can ground her or take privileges away of course. But I don't want to use any kind of physical punishments. 

My husband is the opposite. He yells and spanks. (Absolutely NOT abusive I want to point out). He has less patience than I do so I find myself bothered by how quickly he yells at her. He's also started to want to send her to bed hungry if she doesn't eat her dinners. I'm thinking she's too young for us to start this! Absolutely not going to have anything sugary or whatever but a healthy alternative should be okay. 

If I don't follow along with his desicsions he gets upset and says I don't let him have any authority. I'm scared as she gets older she's going to feel like she has to behave different ways with each parent and I don't want that! Any suggestions on how to work on our divide?"

(It was a tricky decision to put her in preschool during a pandemic, but there are very few cases where we live and we judged that the benefits of socialization, learning, etc. would be the worth the risk.) She was doing so well at potty training before preschool -- she was listening to her body cues and pretty much never had accidents anymore, except overnight, which is fine. Now, weirdly enough, she's continuing to do just fine in preschool (they said she's ready for underwear and don't want me to send spare pullups anymore) but she's WORSE at home! It's like she saves all her effort for school and then doesn't bother anymore. Accidents all the time. So frustrating! I guess we're going back to the old system of just making her sit on the potty every hour, no exceptions, until she starts listening to her body again. Anyway, it's not a big deal but I just wanted to let it out ... especially because I asked her ten minutes ago if she needed the potty, she said no, and then five minutes later she cheerfully announced, ""Mommy, I had an accident!"" &gt;:("

So I’m living with my mom rn and she decided to take on my niece (my sisters daughter) when my sister moved out. (For mostly reasons along the lines of my sister isn’t stable yet and my niece has to be in school.) Anyways I’m currently doing online courses (bc COVID) and it’s on me to watch her all the time bc my mom works a lot to take care of us. 

This child is a monster. She never listens to me, talks back constantly. When I try to have a little heart to heart with her and be nice it always ends up coming back on me with her doing some fuck shit. I’ve made her do write offs, I’ve made her stand in a corner for HOURS. I haven’t spanked her (because I don’t feel comfortable nor want to do that) but that’s the only form of punishment my sister gave her so maybe that’s all that works ? 

Anyways she’s having bad behavioral issues at home and at school. But my mom just fucking ignores it, yells at her for like 2 minutes then lets her do whatever the fuck she wants regardless of what she’s done. 

It’s really really making me mad and I still have no clue what to do about it. Maybe I’ll just have to stick it out until my sister comes back to get her but fuck. I’m sick and tired of yelling and being mean all day every day because this child doesn’t wanna listen. Please help. I’m too young to be a mom lol."
PlasticEvidence1	2021-04-30 16:07:17+00:00	My daughters father has been absent for 9 years.	"Just popped up in my messages a month ago asking to talk to her. He has done this a handful of times (maybe 5 times) since her birth. I told him he can’t just randomly show up and ask to see her when he has never showed any kind of consistency, and that he needs to earn his relationship with her. My job is to protect her emotional health and entire being. 

He is now saying I’m unreasonable because it’s been a month of him texting to check in and I haven’t even had her call him. 

Which is true, I haven’t even told her that he reached out. I am afraid he will let her down. 

I do also want to give him a chance to have a relationship with her, if he is going to do so properly. They both deserve that. I just don’t want her getting hurt. 

He does seem more consistent than he’s ever been previously but I am apprehensive to talk to her about it yet and am so lost on the approach. 

Also, we live two states away. 

Have any of you ever been here? 

Why is parenting so fucking hard?"
mardeexmurder	2021-04-30 15:55:45+00:00	How do I talk to my 9 year old about appropriate boundaries with classmates?	"I have a 9 year old son in 3rd grade. My parents bought him a cell phone for his birthday back in December because he goes to karate and due to the pandemic, parents aren't allowed in the dojo, so we would have a way to reach him. He didn't use it very often and I would often find it turned off in a desk drawer or dead, so I never thought to check it. He has an iPad and a Switch and mostly used those for entertainment, so I truly figured he wasn't using the cell phone. 

My son has ADHD and severe sleep issues, so at night he usually puts his electronics in my room, so when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he doesn't jump on the games. When he gave me his electronics last night, he included his cell phone, which was on for once. Once I got him asleep in his bed, I noticed his phone had a notification for a new text message. I looked through his messages and saw that he regularly texts a couple kids in his class. 

Most of the messages were harmless, like asking a classmate if they could go online to play Fortnite or showing friends pictures of our cat.  One of the kids he is texting is a girl that he has talked to me about a lot and it's obvious he has a huge crush on her. He's always telling me about how him and this girl (along with other kids) are friends and hang out in school together. When looking at these messages, I saw that my son spams the HELL out of this poor girl's phone. He'll text her like 15 times in a row before she responds, and does that stupid thing where you send a paragraph, one word at a time, so the other person's phone was constantly blowing up. She'll respond every once in a while, and her texts seem like he's annoying her and she's too polite to say anything about it. One of the things that he does is he'll send her a selfie (nothing inappropriate thank God, just his face) and ask her over and over again to send him one back, which she doesn't do. This I feel like is my fault, because my long term boyfriend of 5 years and I (who my son ADORES and refers to as his stepdad) regularly send each other selfies as our way of checking in with each other since we live about an hour away from each other, and my son knows we do that because he usually jumps in the picture. My son probably thinks this is what normal couples do, and I don't think he realizes how creepy and annoying he's being to this poor girl. 

My son is a very sweet boy, but he is HUGE for his age and very strong (he's almost 5 feet tall and 100 pounds, and all the kids in town know he's in karate and has won tournaments for sparring and weapons training). I'm worried that my son is making this poor girl uncomfortable and doesn't understand proper boundaries, or that she may be intimidated by him. We've had talks before about respecting when someone says ""No"" (Side note: I manage a daycare and after school program, and my son comes to work with me every day after his school lets out. We have another student a little older than my son who attends my school, and the student has a huge crush on one of my teachers. The student regularly tries to flirt with the teacher and makes comments to her, and I have heard my son tell this kid several times ""Stop it (student's name), you're being creepy, she's a grown up and doesn't like you like that.""  Me and him have had talks about how the student's behavior to the teacher isn't okay, so he gets the concept of consent, but I don't think he sees that he is acting similar to the student in my school, because the girl he likes is his age and not an adult.) 

How can I bring this up to him in a way that won't shame or embarrass him, but will get the point across that he needs to back off on the texting and stop blowing up her phone? I want to nip this behavior in the bud now so he doesn't develop unhealthy behaviors towards women in the future. Is this something I can do as his mother, or would it be better coming from a man he trusts, like my boyfriend? My son has no relationship at all with his biological father and hasn't since he was an infant, because his father was very very abusive towards women and had undiagnosed personality disorders, so it's very possible that I am projecting my fears on him, because he tells me all the time about the games him and this girl play in school, and he has come home with hearts and smiley faces written on his arms that he says this girl drew on him. 

I know someone will recommend therapy, so I want to throw this out there now : I have wanted my son in therapy for years to help with his ADHD, anxiety and anger issues, but unfortunately, none of the child therapists that accept my insurance are local to me. The closest one is 45 minutes away, which is just not possible for me to take him to with our busy schedules, or the ones local to us charge about $300/session without insurance, which is completely out of my budget. My boyfriend and I are trying to get a house in another state by the end of this year, so I'm praying that once we move we can find a therapist for him. But until that comes, how can I best tackle this situation? Thank you for reading this wall of text. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Found my son blowing up a classmate's cell phone that he has a crush on, and her not reciprocating his texts. How can I reign him in without shaming him?"

Be different, Be you.” It talks about the different ways that disabilities impact children, and how some are visible and others are not (ADHD, autism, deafness, etc). It’s a great book, in my opinion. 

Try not to be so pessimistic about your child’s condition, this doesn’t mean pretend like they don’t have cp,  let them know that CP is PART of them, but it’s not ALL of them, and it doesn’t have to define them. focus on acceptance  and highlight their strengths. 

2. research the type of CP your child has has, so that you can explain it to them and they can explain it to others,  for example.. did you know that children with CP tend to get startled more easier than their peers? I’m super jumpy and didn’t know this was related to CP until recently. I also have a poor sense of direction and tend to get lost easily.  Find out as much about their condition as you can, knowledge is power.. 

Growing up, I was constantly bullied in school for walking with a limp due to cp.. and kids (and even adults at times) asked me what was “wrong with my leg” or why I “walked funny”.. and I never knew what to say or how to react.. if I’d known more about my condition, I wouldn’t have felt so helpless or been so down on myself. I would have been able to explain to others what my condition is and how it affects me, and it would’ve made a world of difference.

3. Make sure your child receives any accommodations he or she needs in school. Ask them how their day at school was and if they’re struggling with anything in particular. CP affects us In so many ways than just what’s physically obvious... for example, I find that it takes me a while to Sort through my thoughts and get my ideas down on paper when writing an essay.. but as A child, I was too timid to advocate for myself, so didn’t get extra time on tests  and writing exercises til I was an adult in college, I also started to voice record lectures so I could go over them slowly on my own time... little things like these also make a huge difference. 

4. Teach them self-advocacy skills. Your child may also be too shy or afraid to ask for extra help, so you have to be their advocate.. but also teach them self-advocacy skills along the way. Make sure they know it’s ok to ask for help, it’s ok to ask for more time, etc..

5. Counseling would have also been helpful growing up, to help me accept my condition and be comfortable in my own skin, and teach adequate coping skills (learning to self advocate, voice my needs, be more assertive, how to deal with bullying, etc...)

6. Never underestimate, shelter or stop your child from trying something new. Tell them that they can do anything they put their mind to, even if they might need some extra help sometimes or some accommodations along the way.

I know that cp is different for every child, and some are much more affected cognitively and physically than others.. but the point is to approach the condition in a more positive manner, from a place of acceptance.
I have a much more positive self-image now than I did as a child.. but this is because I took the time to seek help (psychotherapy and medication) as an adult. I have anxiety and depression, and much of my issues stem from the way that having a disability was stigmatized and always viewed in a negative light.. as something that was “wrong” with me, instead of something thats just part of me. 

If they have social media, have them follow others who have thrived despite advertisities.. I’ve come across surfers, body trainers, therapists, actors, etc.. who have cp or similar conditions. It helps to know that you’re not alone and that there are others out there with your conditions who have thrived. Here are a few that I can think of off the top of my head:

Pronetoride on FB and IG (surfer with cp)
@realchelseabear on IG (disability advocate with cp)
@chrisruden on Instagram (powerlifter and model)
And the list goes on...

I’m now a senior in college working toward my degree in communication sciences and disorders, to become a speech therapist (with a minor in psychology), and I’m able to see my disability in a much more positive light, but this took A LOT of reframing and conscious effort on my part (still a work in progress). Reframing the way you and others around you view and talk about disability (shifting toward a culture of acceptance) will ultimately help your child be more comfortable and accepting of his or herself.

Shameless plug, I also have a YouTube chancel where I teach people graphic design, cricut tutorials, how to make custom Tshirts, etc. it’s mostly voiceovers, but feel free to check it out if you’re interested :

Hammertime2938	2021-04-30 15:45:05+00:00	My ex husband involves my 10 y/o son in child support disputes - how to handle?	"Background: My ex husband and I divorced 8 years ago and have a 50/50 joint custody agreement. Back then, we both agreed on the amount of monthly child support. We did not have a custody battle. We came to an agreement with his lawyer as a mediator and submitted it to the court for approval. 

This has worked fine for 8 years. It is an agreement neither person is 100% happy with, a compromise that we fought over and hashed out for months. 

Recently my ex husband announced he was adopting his 11 y/o stepson. The boy’s mom, my son’s stepmom, refused to go after her son’s father for child support when her son was born (even though he is apparently well off) because she “doesn’t believe in child support”. The man is not involved in any way with my sons stepbrother. 

Then shortly after, the day I got home from the hospital from having twins last December, he starts harassing me about getting child support lowered. When he doesn’t get the answer he wants immediately because I’m sleep deprived and healing from double childbirth, he starts trashing my family and his wife joins in. (I should add, I am a stay at home mom and that’s what they keep attacking. While I do actually love being a stay at home mom and am very happy about the circumstances, I didn’t initially choose to stay home. I was working on my IT career last year when I got laid off and then we got pregnant with twins. My hourly pay isn’t enough to pay for 3 kids in full time childcare and my husband makes enough + wriggle room to support us.) I ended up just blocking her and didn’t respond.

Then my ex husband proceeds to tell my 10 y/o son how much he pays in child support and that if he wanted something, he just had to demand it from me and that I use all of the money on the new babies. He then refused to give him to me a day earlier like previously planned so my son could meet his new baby siblings. When my son came home, predictably questioning me, I set him straight that it was not “his money”, that it was inappropriate for his dad to speak to him of it, and that I wasn’t upset with him for bringing it up but that this was a subject that needed to stay between adults. I apologized to him for being pulled into it and he honestly seemed so relieved when I took that off his shoulders. I haven’t heard about it since from him. 

A couple months later, I reach out myself to my ex husband and offered him a deal - I’ll agree to lower child support to the requested amount if you let me claim our son every year since he has been with me more like 60/40 then 50/50 for years and because I do all of the main parenting (he just recently has started strictly adhering to his custody schedule but I did not document the past several years. I am documenting now.) He is also not involved in taking our son to his doctor appointments, he’s not involved with his schooling, and he refuses to be involved with the therapy my son is going through to manage his ADHD. My ex husband doesn’t actually co parent with me. He’s a weekend babysitter I’m not allowed to fire. My ex husband and his wife don’t even qualify for the child tax or earned income credits (I’ve heard him gripe about it) so I thought this was a fair deal. 

He ended up thinking about it and was thinking he was going to be okay with that deal. I then told him, after receiving advice from a friend, that I was ready to sign as long as it wasn’t considered a permanent change and that child support could be adjusted under extenuating circumstances. He then once again devolved into jabs and insults and eviscerating me and my husband. 

So finally I decided I’m DONE. I told my ex husband that if he couldn’t be civil with me and hash out a deal without insulting me repeatedly then I was just going to submit to the court for a child support review and let the courts handle it (something you can do every 36 months but I’ve never done once in 8 years since the original agreement). He tried bluffing me and saying “then you won’t get to claim him every year and you lose out on the 2021 child tax credit. My lawyer said I won’t even have to pay that much more anyway if we do it like that, so I don’t care what you do” 

So I said “Fine. I’d like to claim him every year but not at the cost of being repeatedly insulted by you”. He said 🤷🏻‍♂️. Still trying to bluff me I guess because he knows I wanted the new child tax credit for our son. 

So I faxed in the review request form so it can just get straightened out in court once and for all. My ex got his packet today so he knows about it now and is pissed. My son is going over there today after school for his weekend but I’ll have a small window of time to talk to him before his dad gets here because his bus stop is at my house. 

My question is: Do I say ANYTHING to my son? There’s a very high chance that my ex husband is going to pull him into this and try to turn him against me this weekend because he is short minded and doesn’t realize that the only person this will hurt is my son. He can’t touch me anymore but doesn’t seem to realize that. 

I was thinking maybe I should say something like “If your Dad tries to talk to you about adult matters like court and child support this weekend, just tell him you don’t want to put in the middle of Mom and Dad fighting” 

Advice? Bus gets here in a few hours."

1. Teach your children (able-bodied or not), that every child is different in their own unique way.

SuperSpyRR	2021-04-30 15:29:00+00:00	Getting a Puppy shortly before having ours first child. Good or bad?	"We’re due with our first child in January, and we want to get a puppy. Is this a good or bad idea?

We’re aware puppies can be a lot to handle. To help with that, we plan to send our dog straight to a well respected trainer to potty train it and such before it enters our house.

Is this advisable, or are we crazy?"
jodikenn	2021-04-30 15:15:10+00:00	Parents of those with spina bifida occulta or polymicrogryia	"Hello everyone, my four-year-old son had an MRI last year that stated he had “spina bifida occulta on L5 and distal tip of conus of L2 which is at lower limits of normal”. Our neurologist never informed us of this but instead told us he had polymicrogyria. I happen to be reading over past MRIs yesterday (to understand his PMG since after a year later our neuro hasn’t made any plan for him)and Happened to catch that diagnosis. I’m just wondering if anybody else is in that same boat as far as diagnosis goes. 

My second issue is after we receive this MRI and although my neurosurgeon never told me this or neurologist for that matter my son was seen by a physiatrist at a different local hospital and with the information they had at the time they decided to give my son Botox two times under anesthesia in his legs because we thought it was just a tonal issue. Now I can’t help but be angry because with the new knowledge of the spina bifida diagnosis I’m pretty positive that Botox would have been no help given the circumstances. I wouldn’t have put him under two times if I knew this diagnosis before hand. I’m just trying to have some feedback from maybe somebody who has been in a similar situation and have some advice. It’s very clear I’m getting a new neurologist and neurosurgeon team but should I be looking at a lawyer for them not telling me about this diagnosis and him having that procedure after? 

I hate to be that person but my sons been under a significant amount of surgery for such a small age that any anesthesia is so crucial for him to receive and the fact that this wasn’t even a helpful procedure makes me so upset. I hope this makes sense."

I gained a bit of weight since lockdown and being out of my usual office routine, which included an exercising commute and different breakfasts/lunches. I am about 5-10 lbs overweight, which isn’t a lot, and I don’t feel that I look bad. I would like to fit in my work clothes again and get back the energy I had. Our family eats healthy and has daily low-moderate intensity workouts.

I started IF this week, skipping eating dinners, to get back to the middle of my healthy BMI range. The problem is my husband keeps commenting in front of our son that I look great and don’t need to lose any weight. My son repeats the same thing now. 

Any recommendations how to have a healthy discussion about getting back on track?"
Midwestmamax2	2021-04-30 15:02:49+00:00	Do you think school district really matters?	"I’m curious what others think about the topic of school districts.

I was reading a report about the top school districts in my state. All of them are in well off suburban areas.

My husband and I would probably never be able to afford to buy real estate in those districts.

We live in a working class suburb that has average schools. They’re better than the schools in our urban area but not as good as those in the fancy suburbs.

Part of me thinks that kids from those top rated schools perform better because of their better socioeconomic status and the benefits that are allowed by that.

What do you think?"

It’s about a friend’s kid who me and my wife totally adore and like but it seems like he is so much spoiled. My friends have this habit of not disappointing their 5 year old. The kid is so stubborn that my friends listen to everything he asks. They get him so much stuff every time they feel they may have scolded him or disappointed him in someways. Jesus! It’s crazy to see what’s happening sometimes. We can’t a say much as it’s their kid but me and my wife wonder if we will also be like that when our kid is that old. I wonder if kids that age needs to be disciplined such a way that they understand disappointment in life and learn to let go of stuff sometimes?
DogeManin	2021-04-30 14:49:36+00:00	Teen cut her arm this morning and I'm not quite sure what to do.	"We have twin 13 year old girls and they really struggled during covid. Their fighting went off the charts and they've been doing therapy for several months now. It seemed to help the fighting but other things are getting out of hand. 

Yesterday we caught one of them (we'll call her A) stealing cash from us to buy vapes. Disappointing but not entirely unexpected. The second we find out, she runs away. She wasn't getting yelled at, we don't have a history of freaking out or hitting, we didn't even have a chance to talk about. She just ran and this is not the first time. We called the police but ended up hearing from her friend a few hours later. Mom picked her up and we talked about the stealing. The money must be earned back and she loses her phone. We moved on and she even did her chores.

This morning she refuses to get up, finally gets up way too late, and is in a rush to get ready for school. She can't find her nails. She starts crying and throwing a tantrum about how her sister must have stolen them. She grabs a knife and starts slicing her arm in the kitchen. I stop her and her mom guides her outside and they leave for school with her screaming about how her life is over and she's not going to school without her nails. 

And that's where we're at. This 100% will continue at some point today. It always does. The nail thing is not new behavior. But the arm slice is. Not sure what to do about that part."

Mattress can’t move and there should be absolutely no sound cause if baby wakes up the world ends... 

And then you have to flex extra hard when you in mid-movement lose control of the situation and your abbs have to save you by keeping you in this tai chi looking vertical position until you regain your balance and do a parkour roll off the bed and kind of have to keep rolling while you have reached the floor to avoid any noise. 

Parents rock.

Looking for some advice regarding autism and sleep in toddlers.

My 2yo has recently been assessed for ASD (waiting for official diagnosis). It really doesn't bother me, just gave us an understanding to his odd behaviours.

His sleep patterns have always been irregular, but the last 2 months have been pretty bad. He goes to bed at 8.30pm but can be up at 12, and stay up til 6/7am.
If he has a nap during the day (1 hour at most) he doesn't want to sleep until midnight, and will be up at 5am.
His daily routine doesn't alter very much, same with the bedtime routine. Dinner at 5.30-6pm, play until 7.30, has some milk, bath, brushes His teeth and then we start the process of getting him to sleep. Unless he gets really upset, we try to get him to fall asleep in his bed.
He gets heaps of exercise during the day, and we avoid sugar and processed foods.

Some advice would be great. I'm a bit stuck as to what else we can do to help him sleep better.
We've tried all kinds of night lights, sleep-aid fragrances, blankets, changing little things in his bedtime routine. Our paediatrician even prescribed some melatonin, but that only lasted one night. He had a mild reaction to it, which left him screaming all night.

I'm worried his sleep is starting to effect his energy levels during the day, in turn his learning abilities.

Thanks in advance"
itsfrankgrimesyo	2021-04-30 14:30:19+00:00	Kids NEED to go back to school and be around their friends!	"We’re going through a 3rd  wave so still on lockdown. My kids (F5, M7) are home doing distance learning. Just like most parents out there, I’ve had enough. 

My daughter is very shy, more than your typical child. When she started JK, she had a hard time adjusting. She started to make progress around end of the year, teacher said she was finally coming out of her shell and making friends. She was starting to enjoy going to school. Then she started SK, still shy but continued to make progress during first semester, started having “best friends”. Teacher said she still needed encouragement to speak up in class but overall there was progress, I was so happy. Then BAM, covid happened.

Since then it’s been on and off. Distance learning, no back to in person, no, it’s not safe back to distance learning (if you live in Ontario then you know what I’m talking about, our government has been flip flopping and gave parents a days notice). I can see my girl regressing. Shes back to being super shy, to the point she refuses to even go on camera during class, won’t participate even when the teacher asks her questions, she said it’s because she is shy. She doesn’t pay attention, even when we sit next to her to help. 

She is only interested in playing with her older brother. And we can’t go anywhere, still on lockdown. 

I’m venting today because I got triggered, some idiot said parents who want their kids to go back to school because it’s “free-babysitting”. No you ignoramus!!!! Kids need to socialize for their mental health well-being!!!!  

I know there’s nothing I can do, the rest of the world is going through the same if not worse. But the next person who calls school “free babysitting” can go eat a dick."
amorell0327	2021-04-30 14:18:17+00:00	Socially anxious 3 year old	"I’m very worried about how my 3.5yo boy handles social situations. I stay home with him and our 1 year old. Since Covid, he’s had only a few play dates with some close friends. Those usually go well once he gets used to everyone. 

We go to the playground often which he loves. But he’s never interacted with another child and hates when one comes near him. He looks for the areas that are empty vs the areas I know he’d prefer. 

Yesterday we had our first organized group event ever: a little soccer camp for 3 year olds. Parents are allowed the whole time so my husband was next to him the entire time. He just cried the whole time. He was so afraid of the other kids, someone taking his ball, etc. He wouldn’t do any of the activities the coach did. He isn’t defiant, just frozen. It just broke my heart. He loves to play soccer at home. 

I’ve signed him up for small group swim lessons, gymnastics and some short preschool camps this summer. He’s signed up for preschool in the fall. I’m terrified he just won’t acclimate. If he won’t participate or even just be calm with a parent with him, how will he do it on his own?"
munchie89	2021-04-30 14:10:08+00:00	3mo will not take bottle from me or go to sleep with me only partner	"Hi All , it's my first time posting. I am a first time dad to a three month old son. My wife and I are having problems with him being very dependent on my wife. He is only breastfed and will not take a bottle from me or my wife, only my mother in law. I have been trying for the last two weeks since my wife is returning to work. Every day I try a bottle (we have gone through Avent, Tommy Tippee, and mum bottles, I am waiting for Munchkin latch and Nanobebe bottles) but he just flicks the nipple with his tongue and does not drink any. He also will not go down for a nap without first being on the breast for comfort so I cannot get him to sleep either. 

So long story short, when my wife goes to work and I am taking care of him, he barely eats and sleeps until she comes home which means a non stop crying fest all day. I feel so useless and frustrated because I am not able to contribute as much as I want and my wife is absolutely drained all the time because of it. 

Any advice would be very appreciated and thanks in advance!"
mustangcbra	2021-04-30 14:06:38+00:00	Son having extremely difficult time moving between homes and missing mom	"Friends,

My son (8) is having an extremely difficult time moving between homes. So difficult that, he is crying at pickup, crying when he gets to my home, breaking down before school starts and having meltdowns at night before bed. He says it’s all about missing mom when he is feeling this way 

His mother and I have been separated for two and a half years and divorced for a year. I am on my second year of living in a new home. I’ve gone to great lengths to make the house comfortable for the kids and ensuring this is a safe place for them physically, emotionally and spiritually. 

His mother lives in our old home(5 minutes away), in our old Neighborhood and he spends 50% of his time there. There he is able to have his friends and everything that’s familiar to him. Here it’s a new home with few friends but I do my absolute best to make it fun while he is here. 

I know my profession as a military pilot does not help this poor kid, I’m gone for days sometimes weeks at a time and he spends that time with his mother. Luckily I am leaving the military soon and transitioning to a civilian flying job that allows me to be home more. I will say, this is all he has ever know so he is used to me being away.

He has recently started counseling again and I’m doing all that I can to help him through his emotions and empower him to tackle these things and self soothe. As a parent this rips me apart to see him like this. He has a five year old sister that does not display any of these emotions and is super happy through all of this. 

Has anyone else faced this? How do you help them through it? This has been going on for two months now and it’s wearing me down and straining our relationship with each other."

One is that he has one teacher for two years who teaches everything. Music, Spanish, History for two years. (I think music is super important personally to be taught by someone who has a music background, also varied opinions overall is beneficial in learning). He's also had a lot of issues with friends and bullies all year. This kids at this school also function different. I've tried to make friends with parents for play dates and they don't seem to either understand or be interested so he never has friends over or has birthday parties of the likes. We want to move him down the street to a public school that would cover these issues and BM agrees.

Now my SS has anxiety and is neurotic. He wanted to move before but now he doesn't and he's very anxious about it. I am also worried he's going to get his mom to say no. It feels mean to go against his wishes but my husband and I feel this new school is going to be substantially better for his overall development. He would actually have kids in the area to hang out with and have a more varied education.

Are we incorrect for pushing this? Is there a better way to approach it with him other than ""too bad deal with it"" ? I want to do what's best but also don't want to cause him anxiety."
moosebeast	2021-04-30 13:47:39+00:00	"18mo only wants me, not partner, to come to him at night"	"Hello, 38(m) father of an 18mo boy here.  His sleeping has gradually improved over the last year or so to the point that he does occasionally sleep through the night without waking up until morning, however he does tend to wake up once or twice and need comforting to go back to sleep and sometimes he'll have a rough night as toddlers sometimes do.  I just pick him up, give him a cuddle until he seems settled, and then put him down - he's usually able to settle himself to sleep from there.

The problem we're having is that he only responds to me.  If my partner tries to go to him, he literally pushes her away and doesn't want her to pick him up.  He just gets more upset if she does.  Possibly this is because once she stopped having to breastfeed, I started being able to go to him at night and basically took over night duties, so he's gotten used to me now and not her.

It's becoming a bit of a strain because it's always me losing sleep if he has a rough night.

I should note that he is perfectly fine with her during the day and they have lots of fun together and he often wants cuddles from her during the day, just not at night.

Has anyone else had experience like this, and did you manage to get them to accept cuddles from the other person at night?"
Journalist_Full	2021-04-30 13:29:25+00:00	Teacher appreciation is next week....	"I feel like such a moron. Monday we got a flyer about teacher appreciation week and there were no dates so I thought it was this week. We participated by making a card for Tuesday, crazy hair Wednesday and even bringing food for the luncheon today. My daughter is also wearing pajamas for today.

NOPE! its next week. The food will expire, they already got their card and nobody said anything to us. They could have at least clarified when we brought the card in Tuesday but no, they let us continue for the entire freaking week to the point we are now wasting food too. 

I am so frustrated and embarrassed.. parenting fail"
MortChateau	2021-04-30 12:52:21+00:00	"2yo not eating her own plate, eating others"	"My 2.5 year old started daycare for the first time a couple weeks ago.  Not full time, but a couple days a week.  Yesterday I got my first bad behavior report from the daycare.  She is a twin, and we knew she would be the one to get one first, but we didn’t expect it this soon haha. 

Her teacher told us that she was throwing away her food and eating off the other kids plates. This was an issue we have had at the house but after reading what other posters had put on here about their kids eating off their plates we opted for allowing her to eat off our plates as it sounded like it was kind of ingrained and an evolutionary quark- kid eats what parent is eating because that is safe/not poison. 

Well, now we know that she is doing this at daycare too, we have to do something. We found out today it’s a kid with autism who’s plate she is eating off of.  I don’t know the specifics of this other child’s condition, but I can’t imagine they enjoy my kid taking their food or messing with their plate. 

What do we do?"
nomoredrama165	2021-04-30 12:40:21+00:00	For parents who made a huge move away from family	"Did you end up regretting it? My husband and I have always been travelers, nomads, discontent to stay in the same place for too long etc and now that we have two kids (2.5 and 6 weeks) we are thinking about picking up and moving somewhere away from NJ, somewhere warm and somewhere we like the general vibe of. Work isn’t an issue since we both can do our jobs from anywhere but we will be moving away from our family. 

For the people who made a big move (by choice) away from family how did your kids adjust? How did you adjust? We don’t have parents babysit very often but it does make me a little nervous my 2 year old will miss the cousins and grandparents. Other than that, should we think about anything else? Thanks!"
MoonTreatment	2021-04-30 12:28:53+00:00	Sleep	"I’ve been struggling wording this so I’m going to make it as black and white as possible. 

I work full time, 10 hr days, 4 days a week. 
Gf is stay at home mom. 

We put baby to sleep around 11pm and I usually go to sleep around 12/1am to get 8 hours before I have to get up at 930am. 

Girlfriend doesn’t go to sleep around 4-5am every day and then when baby wakes up around 7 she wants me to wake up early and watch her before work. 

This morning I got 5 hours of sleep and she just had me call off work because she slept from 4-7am and I’m up WELL before my shift (before I called off) watching baby. 

Does this seem fair to you guys? I just need advice because my job is very physical and I need my 8 hours before a 10 hour day of this stuff and then coming home to take care of baby as well.

2_kids_no_more	2021-04-30 12:15:47+00:00	How do I get my 7.5yo to be more responsible?	"My son is a generally good child, on herbal medication for some concentration issues but otherwise we don't have problems. The only thing is he is very never-minded with his responsibilities like making his bed, taking dirty clothes to the laundry room or even taking his lunchbox out of the school bag.

We have tried so many routes - positive reinforcement, not doing it ourselves so that he doesn't have any lunchboxes for school, I've begged him, I've shouted (don't @ me, imagine walking into a bathroom every day and the toilet has poop and it's never flushed). I've talked about it with him, asked what's happening, explained why we ask him to do the things we ask. I've explajned that I have to do everything around the house, and I really appreciate him helping me with things like picking his clothes up. Nothing changes.

Am I expecting too much? He turns 8 in October, I think he should be able to handle those types of things. How else can I get through to him before I lose my mind?"

Whenever she gets nurse my face, she opens her mouth up wide and covers my nose with it. She doesn’t bite, but she will sometimes lick lol. 

So she covers my nose with her mouth and then starts laughing out going Ahhhhhhhhh! And her face is so bright and funny. It just lights up when she does it!

It’s really cute, but also slimy haha 

Why is she doing this? I like to think it’s her version of kisses, but I know she seems too young to comprehend that."
AnonIntrovert08	2021-04-30 11:08:24+00:00	Parenting Rage...please help	"I feel the need to preface this by saying that my DH isn’t a terrible person. He has many good qualities and is in many ways a great partner and father. But this particular thing has become a major issue. 

My husband is really struggling with anger. Our son (age 7) is smart, verbose, strong willed, and currently being assessed for ADHD. Husband finds it very difficult to control his anger and attitude when DS misbehaves...which leads to escalating behavior/attitude from DS and they just ramp each other up to yelling and total disrespect. To my ears, DH sounds so venomous when he’s angry. He talks about feeling his blood pressure and heart rate rise and his head feeling like it’s going to explode. To me that just seems like an abnormal adult reaction to normal childish misbehavior. 

DH has such a short fuse, I feel like the smallest things set him off (example: DS brushes against the wall absent-mindedly and DH says, “Don’t touch the wall! How many times have I told you not to touch the wall!” And then this somehow turns into a huge fight). In my opinion, many of these power struggles would never happen if DH could just learn to choose his battles and not point out every little thing. DS must sometimes feel like he never does anything right. He recently told DH that he feels afraid of him sometimes. DH’s interpretation is that DS is trying to manipulate him by saying that. I think DS was trying to be honest; DH can be fun and pleasant to be with BUT he can be frightening when agitated. 

In general I feel like DH expects DS to behave and reason like an adult. Honestly, he expects more self-control from DS than he is willing to put forth himself as a fucking full grown adult. How can someone expect a child to learn to be respectful when disrespect is modeled? DH will say “BUT I’M THE PARENT.” Meaning it’s OK for him to act that way. To me he looks like a tantruming toddler who wants to look big and strong; it’s hard for me to respect that in a grown man, so probably hard for DS too. I just...expect better from an adult. I’ve tried telling DH privately that I never want DS to speak to another person that way, so please don’t model that for him. He doesn’t see anything wrong with it. He’s the parent. He’s the big maaaan of the house. 

I try to play peace maker and get them both to calm down and de-escalate. Then DH is angry with me for what he views as me not taking his side. Accuses me of disrespecting him and choosing DS over him. I’ve told him so many times that I’m trying to help them both calm down and speak respectfully, but he does’t ever really get it. We’ve discussed this over and over. I’m so sick of it and hate that I see DS emulating husband’s behavior (he hates when DS does it but doesn’t realize that it mirrors his own behavior). After DH and I privately argue the same soul-crushing argument, he will come to realize that he was out of control and talk about doing better. Then a few days or even hours later it all happens again. 

Bottom line - this is a huge problem. DH learned this behavior from his father (who DH acknowledges had major anger issues and was frightening to him as a child). I’m afraid my son is learning to do the same. I resent DH. Last night after the kids were in bed we fought about this (again) and I got so frustrated that I told him I hate him sometimes. It was a terrible thing to say but I can’t bring myself to try to correct what I said. I don’t hate him exactly but I hate this part of who he is. 

DH will not get therapy (I’ve asked many, many times). Leaving is not an option. Apparently listening to me is not an option to DH. So...what’s left? I feel completely helpless, powerless, and frustrated by this cycle of anger. Any books, online courses, etc. helpful for anger issues? Partly I just needed to vent because it feels hopeless but maybe there’s SOMETHING that could help."

narratoritwasnt	2021-04-30 09:51:54+00:00	Looking for toy/activity/creative suggestions for an almost 5-year-old	"Hi parents,

With 14 months of counting of COVID (we're in Europe) my almost-5 year old son is often home at least a couple of days during the week from preschool (it keeps going in and out of emergency care) and I have a 2 year old as well. The 2 year old still naps during the day and of course on weekends too, so during naptime, I have to have some activities to keep my older one occupied so I can actually get some work and household tasks done. He's getting a bit bored with what we currently have in rotation which means he basically wants attention most of the time, so then I can't get much done. I'm looking for some fresh ideas of toys or activities for him to do that aren't just watching movies. 

Here's what he already likes: books (including listening occasionally to audio books), Duplo (he's starting to get into Lego too), art projects (but this usually only occupies him for maximum 10 minutes at a time), imaginary play. He will still occasionally play with Brio trains and some toy animals and vehicles. Some of his interests are buses and trams, the ocean (he loves Finding Nemo and things like sharks and fish), the movie Frozen, anything to do with Winnie the Pooh, and numbers and letters, he is currently figuring out how to read and can actually do a lot of first and second grade level math problems. 

If anyone has some suggestions of what else to try or some toys their 5 year old really loves that I haven't thought of yet I'm all ears."
Dolla_Dolla_Bill-yal	2021-04-30 09:34:30+00:00	I miss my dad TW: parent loss	"I just lost my dad. I don't know what to feel or how to feel. I know this may not even be the right community for this post but I feel safe here among other parents and peers to just let some of it out.

We were supposed to have dinner together with my kids this past weekend. He post poned because he wasn't feeling well. No big deal, but I'm potty training the toddler this week. I let it slide, I didn't follow up till Wednesday. I couldn't get in touch. Same story yesterday. I asked my brother to go check on him as he lives closer... He was gone.

Dad's hug your babies for me tonight and today, I know I wish I could hug mine right now. Just one more time I would give all the money in the world to hear him say my nickname.

I swear my oldest son (2 yo) knew. He woke up from a nap asking for grampy, all afternoon, on Tuesday. We hadn't discussed anything about a visit, since my dad had postponed (I do this on purpose because I've seen how hard it rocks their little worlds to have plans change at the last minute when they really want something).

I like to think he came to say goodbye. 

How do you explain this final goodbye to a 2 year old?

I hate this. I hate it fully. He was supposed to be here for a much longer time. We have memories he needs to be a part of. It's not fair. 

Thanks for reading if you did ❤️ if you are having trouble sleeping, think of a yellow raft in the middle of the bright blue ocean, with the warm sun and beautiful clear skies above, and a pleasant breeze. Allow yourself to get fully enveloped there. It was my dad's trick for getting me to sleep when I couldn't when I was little."

My family is concerned, and it’s really been fucking with my kids. I’ve only been waiting this long because I am in therapy, but now there are concerns for safety. We are all safe right now, but how much can you excuse? I mean, some of this shit.. well, I can’t keep compromising my mental health for someone who doesn’t see their behavior as abusive or control. Especially without reason. 
Should I waste my time and trying to get him to go to therapy with me? Should I just do what’s been in my heart and on my mind and just listen to my psychologist who wants me to finish this up and then decide? Or listen to my husband who is clearly abusive and manipulative and begging for more chances?"
meat-delivery-system	2021-04-30 07:33:43+00:00	Four Month Sleep Regression	"I’m currently in the thick of this phase with my 16wk old. She is co-sleeping in a sidecar cot next to the bed, and will put herself to sleep after being fed and changed throughout the night (currently waking 4 times a night instead of the previous two), and is being breastfed.

But what is going on with the daily naps?! She has never been a “good sleeper” when it comes to daytime napping; 20-40min and then bam. Wide awake for another 90-120mins. She usually sleeps in a baby sling so that I can get something done around the house, although she will also sleep sometimes from being nursed. Sometimes she will spontaneously fall asleep in her bouncy chair or baby nest.

But damn, the last few days have been horrendous. She is exhausted, sometimes to the point of total baby meltdown, and nothing seems to be consistently working. When she does fall asleep it will sometimes only be for 5 minutes! Then she’s awake again, but clearly still exhausted and once again refusing to go down.

What have been your experiences of sleep regressions, and how have you handled them?"
intlmanofmystery1	2021-04-30 06:33:09+00:00	Super frustrated dad here. Toddler (18mo.) has stopped putting himself back to sleep...	"Every night around midnight toddler wakes up. I go in, change their diaper, sit with them for a few minutes until they’re back to sleep.

For a while it maybe took 30min. tops. However, lately it’s turned in to 2-3, sometimes 4 hours of screaming and tantrums only for them to wake up at 7am again. 

I’m out of ideas here. No matter what I do, they won’t go back to sleep. They’re fully capable of it. They’ve done it many nights before. But this is turning into an every night thing. 

So me going to bed about 10/11 to wake up at 12. Be up until 4, then need to wake up at 5 for work is not going to be very good.

What else should we do? I think he’s gotten too used to me sitting in there with him that he doesn’t want to be alone now. What will often happen is they fall fast asleep, I tiptoe out, then five minutes later they roll over to see one of us not in there and has a meltdown."

I wrestled with this decision but I decided that I couldn't helicopter anymore.  I get home and my son tells me that he got into an altercation with a group of older boys and the things they said to him.  Now I know most parents think their kid is infallible but my son is a soft boy.  My partner and I have had many talks about this (not in a queer Id way, more like fear he'll be taken advantage of way).  So he told me they were cussing he was called a n***** and they threatened to beat him up, and an adult intervened.  But this is the thing, he was more bothered by the curse words than the n-word.  In a way I  realize this is the first time he's heard it as a slur and it doesn't mean much to him.  He was more bothered by s*** and f***.  Idk, I remember the pain of hearing the nword, where he just relays it like they called him stupid or something.  I guess I'm kinda happy that it didn't cut him to the core like it did with me."

cheza_mononoke	2021-04-30 05:32:44+00:00	Moving 2 year old to toddler bed after falls from crib	"My 2 year old (and 3 months now) keeps climbing out of her crib. Every 2 seconds I swear we put her down and walk out and she’s back out of the crib. She’s a climbing ninja. She shares our bedroom. She doesn’t try to get in our bed or anything. My mom got her a toddler bed but we will be moving her to her sisters room when we transition her to it. I don’t like the hazard the crib tents have although I do realize there’s a hazard for her falling climbing out of the crib. She has fallen twice now trying to get out. Besides that she can get out of the crib no problem. She can also open any door. 

My issue is, with our other 2 kids (11 years before this one) we would switch the lock to their baby proofed room and lock them in. We would go in when they cried too hard for too long and calm them, but then lock it again. (At the time this was recommended by their doctor). My husband doesn’t want to lock her in a dark room. I agree. It’s the only thing that worked for the last two. We end up spending an hour each nap and bedtime with her just putting her back in her crib and shutting the door. Over and over. 

Is there a better way to do this? How can we keep her in her crib, or transition, or avoid locking her in?"

Looking for co-parenting with a narcissist resources, with a specific aim/theme with the child's welfare.

I co-parent with my ex who has narcissist traits, and our relationships has improved ever since I recognized what she was and moved my approach to be more goal oriented and less emotional.  However I recently released that it effected our child (8M) who has started picking up her traits and habits.

Examples taken from a website

Believing they are better than other kids 

See getting attention as their right/need to be center of attention

Withdrawal from others who do not give attention or admiration

Not expressing gratitude to parents or others for being kind 

Excluding other children from their playgroup based on superficial characteristics (they are uncool)

Not taking responsibility for their actions and the consequences

Throwing temper tantrums when criticized 

Resentment at being told what to do

• refusal to listen to authority (teachers, doctors, anyone).

I've been to focused on working on how to live with her narcissism and have realized I have neglected my child and how her narcissism affects him.

Any resources or podcasts is much appreciated, more stuff I have found so far is fnarcissist parenting is for when parents are still together."
iamabigail2004	2021-04-30 04:11:25+00:00	Nakedness	"Alright, my son is 4. We have the neighbor boy, a 6 year old, at our house all day 2x a week, while our Nanny takes care of them. After she left today I didn’t realize the two of them had gone upstairs to my sons room. Next thing I know, I’m walking in on them under the covers, completely naked. The 6 year old clearly knew whatever was happening wasn’t a good idea. My 4 year old was an open book about the whole thing, but he didn’t seem to understand what happened very much. They’re both boys. From what I gather there was no touching going on. My son did say this wasn’t the first time the friend had asked him to take off his clothes. I’m totally at a loss. I was shocked. I tried to talk them through it as best i could. The other little boy begged me to not tell his parents. Of course I had to, because I felt like we needed to talk and all be aware of what happened. Think this mama is overreacting? My son hasn’t had very much interaction with other kids, so he worships the ground this kid walks on. Also he’s totally not into his body yet - so I’m thinking he wasn’t exploring it. Any thoughts or guidance?"

I’ve been over a few times to help out and bring food and oh my gosh does holding that little baby do something to my brain. He is so small! At one point I was holding him in one arm and had my daughter on my hip with the other and she softly touched him on the foot and did this sweet little whisper sound she does when she is in awe or amazed. I could have cried a river right then and there. She is so good with other kids and I know I want more than one anyway. Would it be bonkers to have two 18 months apart?
DistractedIdealist	2021-04-30 03:55:40+00:00	Do you think it’s worse when your husband yells than when you do?	"My husband and I got into an argument tonight about yelling. We have both acknowledged that yelling isn’t useful in discipline. We both know this, but of course, we slip up time to time. 

When he yells, it’s very primal and intimidating. He’s a bigger guy with a loud, deep voice. He lifts his shoulders up and gets in my 7 yo daughter’s face, sometimes pointing a finger down. She always gets scared, sometimes hides, but always complies. In these cases, I usually tell my husband to calm down and console our daughter. I try to say to my daughter, what he’s saying, in a calmer tone. He finds this so maddening and disrespectful.

When I yell, I don’t have the loudest voice and my daughter doesn’t really get scared of me. My husband rarely intervenes and just lets it be. Sometimes afterward he will tell me I didn’t need to yell about it, I overreacted, etc. 

He thinks it’s bullshit that I get away with yelling and he doesn’t. I always step in to womansplain or whatever it is and he feels like an asshole. I told him I absolutely wouldn’t mind if he stepped in and told me to calm down when I was yelling, but to me, it looks like he doesn’t see it necessary because I’m not intimidating or seem threatening. 

To boil it down; I sense that our daughter feels unsafe when he yells but not for me. My husband thinks I’m being sexist.

Is getting mad at your child automatically sexist because the masculine parent is naturally more intimidating?"

My son is going into the second grade next year and has recently been diagnosed with ADHD. He is having a lot of trouble learning to read. He has been put in a special class at school but I would really like to find a program maybe on the computer or an application for a tablet that will make it fun for him. There are a lot of tears when we try to practice reading with note cards or do the work books his teachers send home and it breaks my heart. 

I need something that will help him feel more confident in himself. He enjoys puzzles and math a lot so maybe some sort of game? I’m going to start working 60 hours a week soon and I am already really struggling to keep up with all the work he needs to get done.

I would love to know what has helped you guys with your littles!"

I.am.exhausted. I have a soon to be 1,3,and 5 year old respectively. I am in the midst of potty training the soon to be 3/5 yr old. It has been a constant battle for the last 6 months. I finally threw away my oldest child's pull ups to the diaper monster and they have been running around naked. We potty every 30\~60 minutes roughly. They don't self initial though. I don't get much else done and I am constantly stressed but it's a work in progress! My 3 year old will poop on the potty by themselves (self initiated) and pee but only if pooping. Obviously the baby is still in diapers. So that's potty training!  


My husband works from home from 8\~7 in various hour stretches, sometimes at night and sometimes weekends. It's a schedule that isn't consistent so I feel like Im solo-parenting most of the time. I had a career before I had the baby but I quit to stay at home with the kids because the cost of daycare was more than I was making + pandemic so it just made more sense. Ya'll. IT's SOOOOO tiring. I feel guilty because I get annoyed with my kids, I'm usually sleep deprived, and we struggle to get out because of social distancing at a park near here is almost impossible. My oldest isn't ready for school yet because I'm working on potty training, trying to teach them numbers/ABCs and they have absolutely no interest. (We have been working on the letter C for 2 weeks now). I feel overwhelmed and guilty at the same time. I'm ready for the 5 year old to be in school but it's my fault they're not prepared for it.   


I love them but I miss my own identity. I miss ""me"" and even when I have 5 minutes of ""quiet"" I feel guilty I'm not being productive. On top of that, I miss feeling like more than a mom. I miss my spouse and the non-parental side of this, which then adds more guilt. Obviously, they're my kids, but I always feel like I'm not good enough. There's never enough hours in the day to get things done + meet the needs of my family so house chores usually fall to the side. Kids seem mostly happy, but they constantly want to play. I. DON'T. WANT. TO. I have no interest in playing hide and seek where they run and hide in the same spot. Every time. Literally they just want to be chased and I don't feel like it.  


What do you all do to cope?  


Sincerely,  


\~Tired, not enough mom."

Just a little background info. I haven't had a phone for about a year and a half, because my mother thinks i do dangerous things on social medias. There was an incident a while back, but noting too serious. I want to bring up why having a phone would benefit me. I have a lot of mental problems, such as BPD, anxiety and depression and i have no way to contact friends and reach out to people. Its really hard, because my mom wants me to reach out to kids through the school supplied computer, but i would have to email them and i feel like thats really embarrassing at least to me. I dont wanna make new friends through emails. And not having a phone makes me feel so alone and sad, because I have nothing to do in my spare time and my parents will sit there on there phones talking to people and scrolling on Facebook. My parents tell me to have people over, but I have literally no friends, because I have no way that i feel comfortable enough to use to reach out to people. I need ways to try to convince my parents that I will be safe with a phone and use it correctly. She says they were talking about getting me a phone, but I really think I need to help push that along, because who knows how long that will take. Anything will help, thank you :)"

I just found out that our insurance offers mental health services such as therapy and I’ve already scheduled an appointment with his primary care doctor to start the process.

He now lives with my fiancé and I. 
He doesn’t see our mom often because she’s putting work first and hasn’t made time to come and see us. 
He moved to a new city and started a new school and doesn’t have any friends due to Covid.

SnooMuffins6969	2021-04-30 01:15:27+00:00	In need of some advice!!	"A (not so) quick rant! Advice needed!!!!! 

I gave birth to a beautiful &amp; tiny Babygirl in December. She stayed in a the NICU for two days due to sepsis &amp; low birth weight. 

Only a handful of people have met my daughter and I’m very strict with mask wearing, hand washing, sanitizing etc because my baby was born a premie. 

My husbands sister has always treated me like crap because their mom and I had a big argument over me using the washing machine when her other son aka GC needed to use it soon as he saw me loading up my laundry. 

Hubby’s sister had covid around October and continued to party the minute she realized the 14 day quarantine was up. Didn’t bother to retest herself btw. 

I didn’t allow my husband nor his mom to announce the birth of my baby especially to his sister because his siblings were only being nice to me once they found out I was pregnant. I never got a congrats, no one spoke to me unless my husband asked me to clarify anything... y’all know the deal with JUSTNO’s. 

Once we announced on the book of faces that I am home with my baby, hubby’s sister immediately called their mom crying that she was butthurt no one told her about my baby’s birth. She’s VERY obsessed w my baby and has subconsciously admitted that she would like to keep her most of the time as her do over baby. 

She has been begging my hubby to let her carry the baby despite admitting in my face that she goes to department stores EVERY day during her lunch because she gets bored and she works at a local phone store. 

A few weeks after she admitted about going out all the time, she invited us to my MIL house for dinner and I (stupidly) agreed as long as she kept her distance. As soon as we got there, she immediately got up and started greeting my husband and then proceeded to say she was washing her hands so she can grab the baby. I nicely told her that there was no way I’m hell she was getting the PRIVILEGE to hold her and she asked my husband to bring her car seat in so we can put her in there. (why? I have no clue) After I told her the car seat will stay in the car and there was no need to put my daughter in it if I was inside holding her, she lost the happy sparkle of hope in her eye and immediately started pouting and washed her hands anyways to avoid awkwardly walking back to the kitchen. She started touching my baby’s foot and getting WAY to close to us which made me super uncomfortable so I stopped back and walked away. 

Fast forward to my daughters 4 month physical at the doctors. 

My husband texted his brother (the GC) that he wasn’t prepared to see our baby cry when she receives her vaccines. His brother just responded along the lines of that sucks and asked for pictures. 

He then proceeded to ask my husband if he can see her when he surprises their mom on Mother’s Day.... without talking to me about it he told him YES. He then asked if we were gonna let him carry her which my hubby said “sure as long as U wear a mask” this INFURIATED ME because he also made my life a living hell when I lived with them in their parents house and this man also got covid around New Years and kept pestering my husband to let him see and carry the baby.... on New Years. I guess I can give him the “benefit of the doubt” that he “didn’t know” because he told my hubby that he had covid after he traveled back to the state he is currently living in. 

I’m so upset that the same people who took their time to make sure I always felt isolated on holidays or family events all of a sudden want to be a big part of my life JUST because I had their brothers kid. Am I wrong for keeping a grudge? They never apologized, and never will because “they have too much pride” according to my husband. They still don’t talk to me or acknowledge me unless they want to know personal details about me and the baby like “does she breastfeed, how many times does the baby poop” etc 

I don’t want my husbands brother near my baby or me and my husband knew I would be in a vulnerable state of mind the day of my baby’s vaccines so that was the perfect time to tell me he already gave his brother the go ahead to meet and carry my baby. 

How can I talk to him in a mature way that won’t lead to bickering that I simply DON’T want my child to have a relationship with people who hurt me emotionally and psychologically for 3 years straight. Any and all advice is wanted. 

If u read this far... thank u!"
cacme	2021-04-30 01:12:23+00:00	I toured my almost six year old's new school today and had to fight tears throughout.	"Like so many parents, my kiddo's life was absolutely put on hold last March. He was in preschool, excelling, happy and well socialized. Then boom goes the world. Partner and I both lost our fulltime jobs and we all went on lockdown mode. 

Fast forward through the crazy and we made the somewhat desperate decision to pick up and move 400 miles away to an old mountain farmhouse so we could split costs with family and start something new. Our jobs weren't coming back (entertainment industries) and it was that or rapidly run out of money in our old beloved city with very few prospects aside from delivering food. 

So we did the big thing and decided to start a small farm and contracting business to boot. But that left our five year old without his friends, isolated beyond just covid in a rural region where the closest school is literally up hill both ways and a half hour away on the best day. 

We homeschooled. We tried to at least. But between starting a small business, a farm and working part-time and remotely to make ends meet, it hasn't been fair to our dude. He's made huge leaps in math and science and I can't believe how fast he's picking up coding just by playing minecraft on a raspberry pi linux system. But he can't read, at least not fluently. He gets frustrated with the alphabet and writing. And it makes me feel like I'm failing him. 

So, we just enrolled in the far off rural combined school that I was worried would be too white, too behind in academics and too outdated due to its location. I was a privileged, prejudiced nimrod about it, turns out. Even though I always planned to enroll him in school in our new county eventually, I couldn't let go of all the guilt I felt taking away city advantages from him in his education, despite the advantages of growing up on a permaculture farm in a national forest. 

I took kiddo today to turn in paperwork for registration and get a look at the school. The school is brand new. Nestled between rolling hills with a backdrop of the Blue Ridge Mountains and multiple playgrounds, green space and fields to play in. 

I rang the bell and was greeted by the principal no less. He walked me through the paperwork with the front desk admin who told me she knew exactly whose house we now lived in, as she had grown up down the road. 

The principal was planning a fire drill but still found time to give us a tour when kiddo said he wanted to see everything. He showed us every wing, the beautiful gym, the playgrounds, the music room and the magical library. And he even introduced us to kiddo's TWO teachers, in a class of 15 kids average. 

The cake was the lego robotics lab for kiddo. And also the cake was me trying not to cry at not only the excellent display of fine tuned education but also the fact that I was so wrong in my expectations. 

This has been a very long story about how excited I am for my son to go to school in a rural region, and how very prejudiced I still am about rural education coming from an inner city environment. 

I can't wait for kiddos first day, even if we have to be up at dawn to get on the bus. And he can't wait either."

My son was born at 15th percentile weight wise,but he dropped to 2 at 1 year when I went back to work,I took some time off and it went back up to 15th percentile at 18 months,now even I'm home his weight has plateued at 2 years.
When he was around 1 years old I could distract him at mealtimes and he would eat.Now that he's 2 and more aware of his appetite he stops eating when he thinks he's full. He doesn't take any sort of milk since he stopped breastfeeding at 1 years old.I don't give him any snacks,always stick to bread,red meat or veggies/fruits.
Anyone here please give me advice on how to increase his appetite or make him eat more.Im so stressed that he'll go back to 2 percentile."

As of like 3 months ago, there are times he will smack the fork/spoon away when it comes to lunch and dinner time. Especially this past month he has gotten worse. When he does this, i will kick back for a few minutes and then try again, but he will keep doing it so at that point and pack it up and he’s done after like 2-3 bites. Its very irritating.

A few weeks ago we changed him over from the crib to the toddler bed.  After the change he would still lie in bed and squawk for us when he wanted to get up.  He's been climbing in to bed himself almost that entire time, but he's never before today got out of bed on his own.

I was taking a break and I happened to walk out of the office and saw him coming out of his room.  He got out of bed and opened his door all on his own like a big boy.

I'm happy, but sad because it means he isn't my baby boy anymore."

We got a lot of refusal and screaming and push back so we dropped it for a couple months and tried again after she turned 2.... Then 2.5... then 3... You get the picture. She is in daycare monday-friday all day. * She is 100% potty trained at daycare.* But once she gets home, she wants absolutely nothing to do with it. We have tried sticker rewards, bribery, chocolate, candy, praise, modeling, different potty seats and toilets etc etc. I have read all the books. We've done the naked method. Nothing works. On Monday we got rid of the pull ups. They are no longer in the house. The problem is, she wakes up in the morning - she will NOT use the potty - then goes off to daycare. She comes home - she will NOT use the potty - and then goes to sleep and at this point I put a diaper on her for nighttime and she pees at some point during the night. She is capable of holding her pee for hours. She has not pooped in several days since we got rid of the pull ups. She will not poop at daycare. I know she understands what to do and how to do it. I don't understand why she will not do it at home and I am at a complete loss as to what to do."
justastarlight	2021-04-29 23:33:53+00:00	Should I let MIL change diapers?	"So MIL lives with my husband and I. She has been changing my 6 month olds diapers since he was born. At first I had no problems but now I am starting to feel weird about it.

She always changed the diapers of BILs kids and him and his wife has no problem with it. Every time she goes to their house (they have a 2 year old and a couple older kids) she changes their babies and checks them  because supposedly they don't change the babies often and they always have dirty diapers when she comes over there. 

Anyway every time we hand MIL my baby she will check him for pee or poop even if I might have just changed him. If he is crying she will yell from her room ""check the diaper!"" If my baby is just playing contentedly she will check him. I never go too long without changing my baby and he rarely gets rashes

I just let her change him but the thing is I cloth diaper and she never uses them! I only use disposables when all the cloth ones are dirty and I haven't gotten the chance to clean them. I keep the cloth diapers right there and hide the disposables away. But she will go out of her way to grab the disposables even if I always tell her to use the reusable ones! She always complains that they are too hot for him. 

I 
Anyway today particularly annoyed me a lot. I change and feed the baby. Then my husband takes the baby to his mom so that we can eat lunch. She comes back with the baby 15-20 minutes later and askes in Spanish to my husband (since they are Mexican) about the diaper. I reply instead of my husband that I just changed him and he is good. She completely ignores me and procedes to start changing him complaining once again how warm it is! I ask her what happened, did he poop? And she told me no, ""it smells like pee""  and she switches to the disposables again.

I go over and check the diaper she took off and there was very little pee in the diaper! She changed his diaper for no reason. I told my husband and he responded like he usually does when I have concerns about MIL. He tells me it's no big deal. He never sets boundaries with her at all, even when I need privacy and she is violating it. 

I'm thinking about telling her myself to only change him with my permission from now on. BIL and his wife may have no problem with her changing their babies,  but I'm starting to think more boundries are needed. What do you guys think?"
mellie_bellie	2021-04-29 23:29:35+00:00	5yo behavior issues advice please!	"Parenting question on how to steer strong negative behavior back to positive.

5yo boy, really strong emotions.  Doesn't matter what type of emotion it is, the reaction to those emotions are to physically/verbally lash out, whether it's hitting, being destructive, calling people names.  

Yelling is not the way to go to get his attention, it only escalates and then of course, physical punishment (a spank) will not work either, as that would only escalate as well.  

It's gone as far today, as him hitting his grandma with an object, and he's bullying his little brothers (2.5yo boys), and dumped out a whole glass of milk.  I don't know the circumstances that led to these behaviors but I feel like he is trying in some way to get our attention and / or display how he's feeling, but I can't seem to get to the root of the issue to help.  Like - What made him get so upset that he would lash out.  Is it merely because he was spoiled rotten when he was born and an only child, center of attention and now - he has to share w/ his bros?  or are we doing something wrong..??  

I try to be a good example in showing how to express your feelings, setting him aside to take a break from the situation, but it doesn't seem to work.  Trying to explain to him - ""If so and so did this to you, how would you feel"" or ""would you want your brothers to do this to you"" type of thing.

My goal is to:  

1. not shame him - I don't want him to feel shamed or that he is a bad boy; in my heart of hearts, I know he isn't.  He feels really really big and doesn't know how to handle it.

2. come to him with a love and teaching mindset, not parenting with fear.  I mean, to some extent I want him to know not to mess with me as the mom, but - I want him to know, no matter what I love him - I want to teach him the right way for him.

How can I help my boy, any positive, constructive and helpful advice is welcome.  Thank you!"

He is almost 13 years old and is somewhere on the autism spectrum, I don't know much about it but my patience is severely strained and it's only been a week.

He can not do much for himself, and my GF has to be right up his butt about taking a shower or brushing his teeth, doing his school work etc. But I suppose that's kind of normal. He is afraid of the dog, he is afraid of the cat he won't leave the room he's in unless the animals are put away.

His parents have enabled him to be eating french fries and ketchup for dinner, or pizza and 6 cans of soda a day, or he will eat a bag of potato chips as a meal. He can not make a sandwich on his own nevermind cook anything.

My GF went to the super market today and returned with like ten bags of potato chips and french fries and just a ton of junk, and I am so angry right now. I know she just wants him to feel cared about for once in his life but I am just so disgusted by his lack of basic skills, or sense of responsibility, humility, and manners. She is a sweet-heart, and I am being kind of a hypocrit because she is an enabler, and even I take advantage sometimes with my own bad behavior. I want to throw away all this junk food but we're no exactly one percenters... 

My point is that I'm not sure how to start or how strict to be with the kid. I want to teach him to have manners, show some humility, and to make responsible choices for himself.

Younger/smaller kids can be held still if needed, older kids can be explained to/bargained with.
Body autonomy is a tough thing sometimes.
Regardless the GP is a big supporter of believing a parent if they say something is up with the kid, so ordered the tests.

I packed items to try and distract him, I packed a lollypop. I tried to explain to him that we were seeing a special doctor who needed to look at his blood. 

He couldn't have cared less about it. He WATCHED the needle go in. He didn't squirm. In fact he didn't move. When he saw the blood in the syringe he said (almost excited)  ""wow mummy it's my blood"". Seriously this kid! 

Turns out he is anaemic and is on a large dose of supplements and reduced dairy intake for a few months. Doctor was hesitant when saying he would need to be tested again, she was a bit shocked when I explained that wouldn't be a problem."

ThrowRA99942	2021-04-29 21:37:49+00:00	Concerned about development of girlfriend’s 7 year-old son	"So I’ve been with my girlfriend for over two years and am slightly concerned about the development of her 7 year-old son. I know it’s not my place to say anything (and I won’t), but I do worry about it. 

He’s a great kid, but he doesn’t seem to be able to do things most children his age can do. For instance, he has a very difficult time following simple instructions. Even the simplest instructions he just can’t grasp a lot of the times. We tell him to do two things and he can’t remember the second thing right after we tell him, then he takes five minutes to do the first one (take his clothes off and put them in the basket for a shower). 

Then there’s the school stuff. He struggles with VERY basic math. Sometimes he can’t grasp the concept of subtraction versus addition. We’ll tell him to do a subtraction problem and he tries adding them, and vice-versa. He can do things like adding fives and tens, but if there is any other number, he really struggles. For instance, 4+7. He’ll think about it, and answer with 15. Sometimes something like 6+3 could end up being 4. 

He also really struggles with reading and writing. He’s getting better, but he still has a hard time reading and writing simple sight words.

Then there are other things that I feel a 7 year-old should be able to do. He can’t tie shoes at all, he has no ability to read an analog clock, he can’t do anything to make his own simple breakfast/lunch; making a bowl of cereal/peeling a banana, making a sandwich, etc.

I’ve talked to my girlfriend a little bit about maybe giving him some simple chores to do every day because he has none whatsoever. Occasionally she’ll have him put his toys away, but that’s rare and they’re laying all over the place a majority of the time. She usually says that it’s a good idea, but nothing has ever been implemented. I’ve suggested maybe cleaning the toilet or vacuum, but she says no to those because he wouldn’t be able to do that. 

I know it sounds like I might be overstepping boundaries, but my girlfriend has stated many times that she wants me to be a father figure, so I’m wondering if any of you have any suggestions to maybe help him along?"
battlerazzle01	2021-04-29 21:17:13+00:00	When do they start giving kids normal math homework?	"I know I’m not the first to complain but good lord. I should not have to spend almost an hour with my fifth grader so he can get 10 math problems done. 

What’s the most aggravating is when I try to solve the problem first so I know the answer and then I’m questioned why I did it the way I did it. Because “that’s not how we’re being taught”. And it’ll be a whole week of this convoluted five extra steps to get to the answer. Then they have one day where they teach them the simplest way to solve the problem AND THATS IT!!!  They just move on to the next thing. The simple way is never retained.  So when they get to the next section, and that old material needs to be called back, they do the five extra step version PLUS whatever three new steps they’re learning, and by the time he’s done, his homework assignment looks like a chalkboard in a college level astrophysics class. I don’t know what I’m looking at, but I know the answer isn’t 2 and 2/5. He shouldn’t have to explain three weeks of math class for me know how to find the answer to 1 and 1/5 divided by 1/2. 

They’ve already moved into decimals. I don’t know why they’ve moved back to fractions. They’ve already touched on long division, I don’t know why they’ve moved back to reverse multiplication or whatever he was describing to me last week. I genuinely feel like it’s just an over complication of math for no reason and the kids aren’t retaining what they’re learning. 

End rant"

rubberlips	2021-04-29 21:06:29+00:00	"Meeting my newborn (especially during a pandemic) is a privilege, NOT a right"	"Sorry, I really needed to vent to someone other than my husband and sister. 

I'm sick of family members thinking that anyone is simply entitled to meet my 6 week old daughter, especially my brother's on again off again fiance.

My brother's fiance has been incredibly jealous of my marriage and pregnancy for countless, nonsensical reasons, one of them being that my husband and I opted for a tiny, simple virtual wedding in August 2020 while her and my brother wanted to have an extravagant wedding on par with their friends in pre-pandemic times. My brother and his fiancee ended up pushing their original wedding date from mid-September 2020.

A few weeks after our wedding, we invited my parents and brother over for a small lunch to announce that a tiny fetus actually crashed our special day. My brother couldn't attend but when we called him to tell him our exciting news, he unknowingly had the phone on speaker and his fiancee heard.

My brother and his fiancee broke up and got back together at least three more times between that day and now because of her outbursts, jealousy and her refusal to seek any sort of help with her mental health issues (which my brother is convinced is bipolar disorder). My poor brother dealt with so much emotional abuse from her but refused to give up on his first serious relationship. It's sad that my brother's, our family's and his friends' reaction to their wedding not taking place as originally scheduled was relief that he wouldn't be tying the knot with her.

Not wanting to see any drama or get annoyed at my brother's then ex-fiancee's adamant COVID denial, I unfollowed her so I wouldn't deal with any unnecessary stress. 

Fast forward to the week that I'm scheduled to be induced,  his on again fiancee messages me, saying how pissed she was at me for announcing my pregnancy on her ""wedding day,"" the original date their wedding was planned for and never took place. I had no idea that the one day my husband who works in health care was off had any significance, and she never mentioned it when she was over for a really nice steak dinner a week after my pregnancy announcement.

I texted my brother a screenshot of her message, blocked her to avoid the unnecessary stress and tried not to take it too seriously. He apologized to me, explained the situation that I was totally unaware of and then let me know that she had a major breakdown because of her jealousy of me and my husband. I was still stressed, and at my doctor's appointment that day, my blood pressure was so high that I was admitted to the hospital. In my hospital bed waiting for my lab results to come back to determine if I needed an emergency c-section (I thankfully didn't), my brother actually asked me to ""just apologize to her,"" which really set me off. I refused to enable someone who couldn't treat me with respect or get help for their own issues.

I am a huge mental health advocate- eight years ago, I was in and out of behavioral health facilities for depression before transitioning to therapy and finding the ideal dose of my current antidepressant. I've cut out as much negativity and drama as possible during my recovery. I've gotten my life completely together, better than I ever could have dreamed, and I never want to go back to that dark time in my life.

Meeting my daughter has been a HUGE privilege for me. I lost half of my body weight to get pregnant, dealt with postnatal depression and early preeclampsia during my pregnancy, labored for over 26 hours then was readmitted to the hospital 1 week postpartum to treat my infected second degree tearing and blood clots. 

Most of my family members have avoided crowds and updated their TDAP vaccine AND received all doses of the COVID-19 vaccine at my request so they could safely snuggle our baby. 

Meanwhile my brother's fiance is still at it with her jealousy, simultaneously reacting with an angry emoji to my sister's selfie with my baby while texting my mother to arrange meeting my baby. Yes, the same baby that she reacted with an angry emoji to online.

I was afraid to even mail back the RSVP for the wedding set for next month to tell them that I couldn't attend their giant wedding during the pandemic because I have my newborn.

My mother wants me to allow my brother's fiancee to meet the baby, simply to ""avoid starting a war"" in our family, but I'm not budging.

I'll let my brother meet his niece while wearing a mask whenever he can get a day off of work, but I refuse to let his unwell, spiteful, COVID-denying fiancee risk my daughter's health, simply because she is throwing a hissy fit.

Wow, that was a lot longer than I anticipated, but I needed to get it all out.

If you read all of this, thank you!

Whether you read this all or not, please, don't let anyone pressure you into doing anything relating to your kids, especially when it risks their health."
galatitravels	2021-04-29 20:59:41+00:00	To have or not to have another kid? PPD and Loss	"Two years ago, I joined this group when I had my first baby at 29. I had particularly rough PPD but it lasted only three months. My symptoms were deep regret. All I wanted to do was undo the baby. I also had a tough time bonding. By the time my daughter was one, I had bonded, was happy and off any anti-depressants. I recovered quickly. We decided on baby 2, because we wanted another kid and also wanted to take a year old mat leave to travel LOL.

Well, our pregnancy led to a late term loss which was very very very very painful. I grieved the first two weeks, then I was hit by what I think is PPD, and once more I had regret that I have a kid at all! Do you face PPD with a loss too?

So weird.... anyways hoping to see if having another baby really adds value or not. I definitely have reconciled with one kid, but our pregnancy was tough with covid, and the loss moreso, not to mention I am again facing PPD with no kid (URGH). 

&amp;#x200B;

SO one kid or two - how can we manage it without being so depressed? We are expats so lack social support - and amidst covid, enjoying parenting is so hard."
BitchinOriginal	2021-04-29 20:48:48+00:00	Social dilemma	"Hello! I’m looking for some advice about how to further approach a certain situation. 
My kids are very well-behaved for the most part. They’re 5 and 7. They’re good about controlling their volume inside and outside, they have great store and restaurant etiquette, and I’ve really made a point about being considerate to others around them. We’re just regular ol’ lower-middle class people so it’s not like they’re nanny-trained or anything special like that. 

We’ve been having some play dates recently with a friend of mine who has another 7yo and the kid has basically no discipline whatsoever. Screams at the top of their lungs in the car, sprints through the store, encourages my kids to do “bad” things even after I’ve told them not to. They even licked my kid and was wiping spit on him... during a global pandemic. My son started mimicking the behavior, obviously, because that’s what kids do but I told him that it was inappropriate and that “we don’t behave like that.” He knows that and tried his best to behave after that. So when the other kid started licking/spitting at him again he spoke up about it instead of retaliating and the other mom told him not to be a tattle tail!! Instead of telling her own kid to stop harassing my son! 

We’re pretty good friends and she’s the only mom-friend that I have at all, so I don’t want to stop these play dates, I just need some advice on how to handle this situation in the future. It’s also the only non-school social interaction my 7yo has and my 5yo isn’t in school yet, so it’s basically the only social interaction she has at all. She told my kid not to be a tattle tail, does that mean I’m allowed to tell her kid to stop doing certain things? I never want to step on anyone’s toes especially about how to parent their child, but this situation is completely out of control. 

Thank you to anyone who answers, I’m not good at navigating this stuff at all."
Tardb00g	2021-04-29 20:41:49+00:00	Toddler told me a daycare teacher hit her.	"Daughter goes to a daycare I’m not proud to admit I actually pay for which started as an emergency solution to a temporary problem. Her last day is tomorrow but I don’t want to have any of the issues I seem to have every day at a place I pay a full mortgage worth for. 

Ask daughter how day went in car. She said she needs a new school. I said why. She says she doesn’t like the playground. Cool. Side-She tells us first thing every night and morning that she doesn’t like the boys at her school because one of them hits her every day and yells at her. (Since being at daycare, she has become increasingly defiant, aggressive, and really does not like going there. Full on fits, asks days she knows she’s not going if she is just to make sure she isn’t etc.) I ask her how she likes the kids at her school. She says she likes them. I ask her how she likes the adults. She says she likes them. But... not Ms Brittany. Who is miss Brittany? Her teacher is sick at home so miss Brittany watched their class for 4 hours today. Why don’t you like miss Brittany? She hits me. Where did she hit you? On the head. We’re there other kids around? Yes. She said it was an accident and she was trying to be nice. Was she holding you or were you moving around? She was holding me. She went like this: lifts her little arm up and brings it down like a hammer. She showed me right on the front of her head behind her hairline. Get home, mom asks and same story, told slightly different. 

My question is, how do I know when to believe my toddler, how do I make sure I’m not leading her towards any answer, mistakenly, and what actions does one take? I’ve been pissed off and desperate to get her out of this place since day 2 for all different sorts of reasons. It’s getting to the point where I am starting to hold this against my partner who picked the place with no research and has kept her in there for 4 weeks despite all the repeated problems I won’t mention here.  Thanks in advance.

ecw324	2021-04-29 20:39:57+00:00	Looking for help/advice with 2 teenage boys	"I want to apologize upfront that this might be a long post. I’m looking for any help or advice from people who are in or have been in a similar situation. I’m just at my wits end and how to best support my wife and family. So here we go...

We are a family of 6, my wife and I, 2 sons (both from a previous relationship my wife was in) and 2 girls (both are biologically ours). The two boys are both almost 17 and 15. Not because we haven’t tried everything, but they do not live with us full time and are only with us every other weekend. When all of the parenting time was figured out my wife was working an off shift job and their dad quit his job to say he was always available. So things have been this way for 12 years I think.  In reality between sports and surprise trips their dad takes them on, we are lucky to see them 30-40 days out of the year. Have they expressed wanting to be at our house more, yes. Have we tried to set that up, yes. Has it ever happened, no. 

Within the last year I would say they have both expressed a lot of anger towards their mom for the way things are currently. So after lots of conversations with us, and like sit for 3-4 hours talking about life, past and future and things like that, we felt pretty good about where they were at. And these were conversations that they wanted to have. We didn’t initiate most of them. I have no problem sitting down and talking with them either. 

Their mom has gone above and beyond to show them how much she cares and loves them. Simple things like just stopping by their dads to drop them off a coffee or going to their school once a week to have lunches with them, or we have done vacations around things they’ve told us they’d like to see or do. I feel like all we have done is shown them love and support. Hell my wife bought them iPhones and we built gaming computers together and even a streaming room that one of them wanted because he wanted to make YouTube videos. It worked out too as they were able to be here quite a bit more during the pandemic.

It was a few months into them being here more we started to notice both of them were saying things that were very sexist, which did not fly with us. We used it as a teaching moment like you need to be careful with what you say because it can come back to bite you in the ass kind of way. They had posted these statements on their tiktok profiles too. So after that anytime we’d ask them to do something like help carry in the groceries, they’d respond with like isn’t that sexist of you to make me carry them in, or hey help me move this because it’s heavy and your mom can’t move it. They’d respond with, isn’t it sexist to say a women isn’t as strong as a man? Just smart ass stuff. 

It was also around this time that we started doing what we called “gym class”. We’d spend 30 minutes doing something active and 60 minutes doing something without electronics. Otherwise they’d sit playing on some form of electronics all day ignoring other tasks that had to be done (chores). They also expected to be served meals when they were hungry because “you are the parent and you are supposed to take care of me and do whatever I ask you to do. You chose to have kids. That’s the deal.” This attitude does not fly with my wife or myself. Our daughters do not have this attitude either. 

Now during all of this we have majorly picked up on narcissistic behaviors from both of them. Their dad is a narcissist and is also very sexist. So because they see this behavior when they are not here, I get why they act this way. We have zero influence on them. And it has now reached a point where we have not seen either of them in almost two months. Their dad never gets us a sports schedule and he took them on spring break without telling us. So on our weekends there has been baseball or basketball happening. And now they don’t respond to our texts or phone calls. They rarely respond to their sisters. Now if they text us and we don’t answer with if 10 minutes they will blow up our phones wanting an answer. But they can’t respond to us. 

My wife is very heartbroken over all of this and now I am getting to the end of my rope with this. I care about how this is affecting my wife, but I’m more concerned about our daughters seeing this behavior and possibly being hurt by their brothers. Both of them very much look up to their brothers. It feels very much like we have to buy and do things for you to get love from you. And they put zero effort into doing things that show they love and care about us, even though they say they do. Like even if they see you struggling with something, they don’t offer help. I don’t feel like they want to have a relationship or out any work into one. They want us to bow down to them and put all the work in to benefit them and screw everyone else.

So what do I do? Do I tell them that if they don’t want to have relationships with us, they need to come tell us to our faces and then you have to deal with the ramifications of that? Or do we just leave them alone and when they feel like coming back around let them do that on their own or what?

Thank you for any form of help you offer."

I keep having these really troubling dreams where my new baby is here but I don’t recognize him or have any emotional bond or attachment. I can’t recall anything about him, even his name. I’m ashamed to say that I don’t even think he’s cute (supposed to be my own child, wth). My focus is on my first born only. 

I’m sure there is some psychological reasoning behind these dreams. I’m just curious if anyone else has experienced dreams like this? I know pregnancy dreams are wild. Mine were during my first as well. These just make me really sad and nervous."

I produce enough milk but I want to start introducing formula just in case of an emergency. I read online that giving a baby under 6 months water, could be harmful. By that I mean that the baby won’t absorb as much nutrients from the breast milk. When making the bottle with formula I use water. I also understand that 2 oz of water is 1 scoop of formula. But what I don’t understand is how do I know that I’m giving her the correct amount of water, because I worry that I may be giving her too much water. I still want to breast feed but slowly want to also give her formula. Also I was wondering if I needed to boil the water or microwave it before mixing the formula and giving it to her?"

the reason I mention he's autistic is because he's in the middle of a meltdown right now and I feel like that would affect what I tell the parents.

he is currently screaming at the top of his lungs, throwing things, and cursing at me. I don't know how to stop it as this has never happened before to this degree, it's seemingly only because he's at my house, no other reason.

PM_ME_UR_YELLOW_LABS	2021-04-29 20:03:27+00:00	Advice on Blending Families with Toddlers	"Hi! 

I’m in kind of an unusual situation and hoping for some outside perspective/ideas.

I am moving in with my girlfriend in a little over a month. There are a few states between us. I should probably mention I’m also a woman. My daughter is 2, and she has a 2 year old boy just a couple weeks older than my kid, and 3 year old twins. My daughter and I have spent a lot of time at her home, even staying as long as a month. The kids all get along really well, and I adore them. It’s chaotic in the best way (most of the time LOL).  

The other day my girlfriend confided in me that she’s worried she won’t be a good enough mom to my daughter.
When she had her twins, she had little to no support, no family in the area, her husband had a hard time understanding or supporting her, and she had horrible PPD. She had a hard time bonding with her babies until they were a little older. Of course that’s understandable and happens a lot, even with singleton newborns. 
She had a much easier time bonding with her 2 year old when he was a baby. He was an easy baby, and it was just him.

I tried to comfort her by telling her I wouldn’t be moving in with her if I didn’t like the way she treated my kid, that my daughter won’t feel like her kid, at least not at first, and that’s okay. It’s going to take time for it to feel like we are a family and not just visiting, and as long as we treat all the kids the same it will all work out. It’s not like she’s going to be mean to my daughter, she’s a lovely person. 

I’m also much more outwardly affectionate than she is. I think she’s worried that will play a role in her ability to bond with my child, since she’s not really touchy feely. I don’t have many worries about her kids because I’m a total softie and I they’ve been really affectionate towards me. Our visits to her house have been during my daughter’s clingy “stranger danger” phase, so she didn’t like being left alone without me. I’m sure that’s having an effect on my girlfriend’s fears. She’s much better now and will definitely adjust, but it was definitely difficult when I wasn’t in the room and she was having a meltdown about it. That would make me feel insecure too if her kids did the same to me every time she left the room. 

Any ideas for helping encourage/support my girlfriend through this and foster a good relationship between the two of them? 

One though I had was that all her kids have these matching stuffed My First Bears and bunnies. Each of her kids has a different color. She bought my daughter bunnies to match her kids, but they don’t make a bear in that color. She once told me that the bears were the only thing that made her twins feel like they were hers in the NICU. I was thinking of buying a bear and dying it to match the bunnies my girlfriend has for my daughter. I thought it might be sweet to send my girlfriend the bear with a “congratulations, it’s a girl!” card and some nice words? Idk if that’s too cheesy or not. 

So hoping others have advice or opinions on how to help my girlfriend feel more confident :) Thank you!"
deeeelightful	2021-04-29 20:00:56+00:00	The preschool down the street does not require kids to wear masks. Is this normal?	"I just checked the place out and it looks pretty good. I asked about covid precautions, and the tour guide said they've implemented extra handwashing and temperature checks. She said they didn't have to add any extra cleaning because they already had very strict cleaning procedures. When I asked about masks she said that they do not require students to wear them, and presented it in a way that made it sound like an impossible thing to reinforce with young kids. I also could see kids playing on the playground, and literally none of them had masks on (and they were older kids, maybe around 7 or 8).      







      







Now I have a lot of experience with young kids (before covid times) and it is surprising to me that she would say this. I feel like young kids are the most likely to follow the rules, and tend to be easiest to reinforce non-negotiable things (like washing hands!). Am I bonkers for thinking this? Or just out of touch with the reality of this new covid world?"

Recently I caught my manager attempting to steal a portion of the tips I worked for. I confronted her and asked where the missing money was and she gave it to me out of her pocket after I asked. I’ve told the owner about this and he said since I confronted her and that since she gave me the money, he can’t prove she was 100% going to steal it. I ended up quitting my job and walking out mid way through my shift because they had me working with this sneaky manager again. I came back in the next day to turn my shirts in only to find out that the same manager also kept my cash tips from the tables the day I walked out. The owner is sort of acting like this isn’t a huge deal and saying he can’t prove she was going to steal it even though we watched her on cameras take my tip from the top drawer and place it in her pocket. I ended up taking my job back but only because im desperate. I’m moving out of town in 2 weeks and my son is set to start kindergarten this year and I just am not in a position to be unemployed. I need to know what to do. I’m angry and confused about how she’s getting way with this!"
flower_chungus	2021-04-29 19:35:58+00:00	Partner is always comparing how I want to raise my child to his upbringing	"(Long post, sorry!)

I'm 39w and going to be induced on Saturday. This will be both of our first child. Partner is 29M and I am 22F. Pregnancy wasn't planned, but very much wanted and loved. 

I was homeschooled my whole life in a very Christian family (so moral standards were super high and religion was taken very seriously). I had 2 brothers (I was the middle child), we are all pretty close in age but I ended up teaching my younger brother stuff like writing and maths. My mother was also very disabled and my Dad was the breadwinner. They have had a rather bumpy marriage that I got way too involved in. I also pretty much put myself through school as resources were limited. I also experienced abuse within my family. My parents are still together and we both have a good relationship with them as I moved out. 

My partner was raised mostly by a single mother who worked a lot, so he has some really grim stories about childcare. She also had some horrible boyfriends who abused my partner as he was growing up. He has a sister that is roughly 10 years younger than him that he had to take a large role in raising. His mother is Christian, but not at all strict about standards. My partner has no strong feelings for religion. He skipped school a lot, started smoking 13 and was dealing weed by 13. 
 We have a good relationship with his mother and see her on a weekly basis. 

So we both come from contrasting backgrounds plus a bit of an age gap. We are strangely similar though as I have left my church and he has mellowed out and we generally get along super well. 

However, whenever we discuss raising our son, he is always comparing things to his upbringing. For example, he smokes, so I've asked him to be really careful round the baby because it can be very harmful and cause cot death. He's agreed to smoke outside, but is very upset about delaying picking the baby up because ""his mum smoked during her pregnancy and in the room with him when he was a baby."" He's also upset because I don't want to see anyone (besides close family) for the first two weeks because ""his mum went back to work within 5 days of having him."" 

When it comes to discussing things like media, religion, money we are pretty much on the same track but when it comes to hygiene, diet and morals we generally clash. He rarely has any other reason for disagreeing other than ""my mum did this or I had to this for my sister. The only things he agrees was wrong with his upbringing was being hit and being shouted/sworn at.

I understand he had a very difficult upbringing and he is more set in his ways than I am, but it bothers me that he doesn't question his upbringing. It was so hard for me to wake up and realise the issues with my childhood and I have really carefully worked to get out of the hole that I was in and become a functioning adult. There are so many things that I am doing differently to my parents. 

Anytime I suggest that we do something different he gets upset like I'm attacking his mother's parenting/implying his mother didn't do a good enough job. 

I am not. I just want him to see that she did her best, but our best isn't going to look like her best. I don't know how to get through to him. He is super excited to be a Dad, has been really supportive throughout the pregnancy and I don't him to lose that enthusiasm. He thinks therapy is useless due to bad experiences when he was young plus it's very expensive.  

I just don't know where to go from here."

My spicy nugget will be just under 13 months this June when I go on a road trip to visit some family. It's about a 5 to 6 hour trip, depending on stops. Does anyone have any tips for the drive? 

I plan to buy a thing of new toys, and I'm considering letting her watch some elmo on a tablet (but I'm not sold on the idea tbh). I figure we should stop at least once for a diaper change and to let her get out of the car. My partner will be with me, and I'm thinking we can switch who stays in the back with her? 

Any other suggestions? Thanks in Advance!"
amorell0327	2021-04-29 19:03:01+00:00	3 year old night terrors	"My 3.5yo recently started having night terrors (or at least that’s what we think they are). He’s had them almost every night the past 3 weeks. It’s always the same. He wakes up around 2.5hrs after falling asleep. He sits up in bed and starts screeching/yelling/crying. He speaks gibberish and sort of shakes, wiggles around. We just sit with him but don’t try and wake him. We don’t actually do anything, other than make sure he doesn’t leave his bed (he’s never tried). He clearly has no idea we’re there. Then after about 3mins he just lays back down and is silent again. 

It’s really freaking us out! Otherwise his sleep/tiredness doesn’t seem affected. He sleeps from 8:30pm-8am consistently. No naps. Super happy kid otherwise. I stay home with him and there’s been no stress or change of any kind recently. 

Has anyone else’s kid gone through something similar? We’ll definitely bring it up with his pediatrician but I’m just looking for any suggestions or insights. I don’t want to miss something that should’ve looked into. His behavior and happiness otherwise has been totally normal so I don’t feel like it’s actually affecting him negatively right now. It’s more just freaking my husband and I out!"

We have begun the process of potty training our daughter who has just turned two. She is having much success and we’re so proud of her. It has been two weeks and she is quite reliable at letting us know when she needs to go so I am hoping to leave the house a little. 

My plan is to take her on a run using our running buggy, but I am struggling to figure out how to toilet her whilst we are out and about it public. Does she go in the bush? Does she go in the potty? Then what?? I can’t figure out the most elegant solution that meets her needs but doesn’t cause public offence. What did you do?

TL;DR: how do we return to getting out and about without causing a fuss whilst newly potty training?"

I apologize for the length of this post.

***Also if you are replying, please try to be kind. This is not a humble brag post. I am looking for kind discussion and advice. This is not calling out parents with a social media presence, I am wondering how other parents without it manage the pressure! I am super aware that I am privileged beyond belief and that this is something that even bothers me is ridiculous. I am also aware that I sound nuts haha. It's been a long year.***

I am a pastry chef, had a fairly strong social media business presence (for a small city) and ran a successful business at our local farmer's market &amp; from home. 

My mental health took a turn 2 years ago and I was struggling socially. 

I dropped my business, resigned from the market board of directors and started only taking very occasional special orders baked in my home.

A friend strongly suggested I talk to my Dr about anxiety and SURPRISE! I had been functioning my whole life with crushing anxiety and didn't even know it. Long story and a prescription short, and my daily life is so so so much easier. 

Anyway. We've been home for over a year now, our oldest is schooling online and my youngest is a preschooler so we work on that sort of thing through our days. We are an artistic family, are always making/growing/cooking/baking. The kids are sensitive and spirited, they are kind and loving and challenge us every day. We all have outbursts, fights over toys, and sometimes eat buttered noodles for 2 meals in one day. We do our best to guide them gently through the struggles, teach them to believe they are worthy, how to care for themselves, others and their environment. 

My husband and I both manage anxiety. I am a 'type a' person who puts a lot of pressure on myself (I realize this is self-imppsed) to have a clean house, plays with and makes art with my kids, tends to a large garden, cooks and bakes, I don't sit down after dinner until the kitchen is clean, the toys are put away and the bathroom is wiped down etc etc etc. We are also a loving family who are building a strong foundation together. We spend tons of time talking and listening to each other. We both come from families who don't have their shit together. We are doing our best to change that for our kids.

(This makes me sound like I want you to think I'm perfect but I am just trying to get my point across here. I swear like a sailor, love wine, laugh my ass off watching curb, it's always sunny and south park, love horror movies, work very hard on my mental health, smoke the occasional joint, still yell at my kids sometimes, eat McDs and ice cream and am estranged from my brother. I keep it together for my kids. Ha.♡)

Okay, okay I am finally getting to the point! Thank you for staying with me ♡

Here it is: In a world where anxiety is more the norm than not, posting absolutely everything you do/eat/make/feel/how amazing your kid is/parenting skillz are, moms showboating their struggles(this is not the same as getting support online), showing off the super healthy dinner the kids ate, the tea/birthday/sleepover party and the expensive baked goods that went along with it, the matching family pjs, the loving quiet moments between you and your youngest, the latest piece of art/writing/etc your kid made!
and being rewarded socially (online) for doing the basic of things,

My question is this: 

How do I navigate my kids through these inevitable feelings of ""pics or it didn't happen""
How do we gain a feeling of quiet contentment within us, without validation from others? Being happy with not being an influencer, getting likes or views or being a supermommyblogger. 
Just being.... normal!!! 

We all know that there are some days that kick your ass and all you want is for someone to say, ""YOU ARE DOING GREAT"" 
Being an active loving parent/family member can be a thankless job sometimes. We are doing our best in this crazy crazy world and it can be so lonely!

The world is becoming so much more dependent on relationships through social media. We don't live in a bubble. When we deem it age/responsibility appropriate, our kids will have phones. 
I'm not saying I need constant validation. Yet I am human. We need some form of it.  But in a world where it doesn't seem to matter what you do unless it's documented....

Do I even exist?"
abacus_porkrind	2021-04-29 18:00:15+00:00	"My daughter (6) almost referred to a YouTuber as her ""new friend"" and it broke my heart."	"I know things are looking up. I know she's not alone; her entire class/cohort/generation will share a version of her experience but it still sucks to see a young life interrupted like this. She was to start kindergarten this year.  I was worried about all the normal stuff, bullying, peer pressure, bad teachers but overall I was very enthusiastic for her to be among people her own age with similar interests, energy levels, etc.  

My two year old daughter is affected too.  Before this, we had a measles outbreak in my area (thanks antivaxers) so she's basically never had an experience of playing in public with other kids. Now the Portland Children's Museum is permanently closed. My oldest loved that place and sobbed for ages when she found out. My youngest had been once. Maybe twice. I guess she can't miss what she never had but the biggest blow was realizing this is likely why she doesn't like to read with her mom and me. 

From around six months my oldest was at the library every week at least. Story times, free range browsing where she could choose armloads of books herself, other wonderful events (we have a great library).  My youngest finally set foot in the library a few weeks ago. She was delighted. But the groundwork isn't done. That rich, fun experience my oldest and I shared never existed for the baby. 

I know ""this too shall pass"" and they're so young this really can be absorbed by later experiences (I hope). I suppose out of everyone, after those who've lost loved ones, I feel sorriest for kids graduating highschool and collage during all this. But it still sucks. 

That's it. No grand insight or anything. Just needed to vent, I guess."

For much of my life I was fairly certain I probably wouldn’t have kids.  Late in my 30’s I changed my mind and now I am completely in love with my baby and our new family of three.  

I feel like an imposter because other mothers spent their lives dreaming of their future mother duties and I barely gave it a second thought.  I watched most of my friends get married and have babies years ago.  I never had the sense of urgency to do the same.  So when I got married and then, several years later, pregnant I felt like an imposter for being so late on the scene.

An autism diagnosis doesn't scare me too much. I have autism as well so really I'm not surprised. It's just really hard during her tantrums. She cannot Express to me at all what she needs. I have to go one by one: Diaper, sippy cup, food, pain, loneliness, overstimulation, etc. She just pushes each thing away and screams harder. She will barely trip, not even fall over, then scream and sit down on the ground then lay on her stomach and scream. I do my best to pick her up, rock her, say ""I'm sorry you're upset. Itll be okay."" Usually she just gets worse. If I ignore it, she gets worse and it hurts my heart to ignore her crying. I just dont know what to do. I really dont know. I feel stuck and like a failure. Her doctor said to be patient and empathetic because she is struggling to process these deep heavy emotions, but these tantrums last hours every day. I need help."
pfvibe	2021-04-29 17:48:20+00:00	Bf concerned about child genetics	"I am female 19 and my bf is male 22. We have dated for about 1.5 years. 


My boyfriend called me a few hours ago and voiced his concerns about genetics in children. He noted that I have had an eating disorder, struggles with feelings of depression, and anxiety. He is concerned that this would be passed down to children. 


While I understand and share his concerns, I do not think he has the full picture. 

A few years ago I experienced sexual assault multiple times. It resulted in an eating disorder because I thought if I got a flat chest and a flat ass then I would not be provocative or something. I basically just felt really ashamed and at fault for what happened...so I starved myself. I also was left with feelings of anxiety and depression because...no shit. 


No one in my family has/had an eating disorder, depression, or anxiety disorder. 


My point is that my struggles were environmentally and not genetically caused. 


To be fair, I had never told him about the assault because there never was a good time to bring it up and I felt comfortable around him so I just didn’t wanna think back to it or talk about it. 


What are you guy’s opinions on this situation? He wants to end it but I tried explaining to him and I am really heartbroken.

We took our 1 and 2 year old out last night to eat hibachi, it was past their usual bedtime so we were a bit worried but they loved it! And we had to stop by the store to get them new car seats so naturally they each got to pick out a toy, and they passed out in the car on the way home, I feel like this is a parenting achievement and it brought back all the good memories of my own parents and when they would do things like that.

bigglywiggly76	2021-04-29 17:01:28+00:00	Trigger warning!! Pregnant and regretful	"
I’m 16 weeks pregnant and it was planned. However I’ve spent the last 2 months not excited. In fact I’ve been in a deep dark anxiety filled depression hole. I assumed this was due to normal hormones and realizing the loss of my old life, or maybe some depression. However it occurred to me yesterday maybe I don’t actually want this and perhaps I don’t want to be a parent at all. I quickly googled my options and was surprised to feel relieved that I was still able to terminate if I worked quickly. I’ve discussed this with my partner and they are supportive of my choice, and insist it’s my final decision. We used to be committed to a child free lifestyle, then last fall I had a termination. It made me change my mind. I’m wondering if it was too soon after for me to make my choice clearly, or perhaps the influence of leftover hormones. I’m not sure if I’m venting, looking for advice or support, or just wondering if anyone else has gone through the same. Please share your thoughts and experiences with me. Thanks all."

sabeneler	2021-04-29 16:49:11+00:00	Defiance with basic human functions	"I'm officially at my wits end with my 4 y/o. She refuses basic human functions. Everything is a struggle and I dont know what else to try. The one I want to focus on right now is brushing her teeth. 
Context: we have spend thousands of dollars on her teeth already to get them capped and filled due to the 11 cavities she has. Shes 4. All of these cavities developed in the last year (we missed a dental appointment due to covid which I think would have helped avoid this. But such is life).
We attempt to brush twice a day and she refuses. We have bribed, weve put up a chart, we have taken things away, we brush with her, we make it fun, weve tackled her and forced her to. I just dont know what else to try. I cant afford for her to not brush any more. I can't spend any more money on this. 
She doesn't seem to care. She laughs at our frustration, is unmotivated by rewards, and seems undeterred by consequences. I dont like pinning her down and forcing a toothbrush in her mouth, but that's what it has come to for the last couple days. It drives our entire day. It leads to tantrums, it puts all of in the worst of moods. 
Then, after an hour or so sometimes she'll just snap out of it, brush her teeth and all is well. Unphased. 
What the heck do I do to keep this from happening? Its exhausting and is every.singly.day. twice a day."

It’s hard to go to college when you have a kid and have to work. Heck, some teen parents even struggle to graduate high school because they have to work during school hours and miss too many classes.

fortheloveofLu	2021-04-29 16:37:28+00:00	Husband thinks I'm trying too hard.	"So, my husband (45M) and I (33F) have been married for 5 years, together for 8. There is a huge age gap, as you can see, and it has an impact regardless of how much we try to not let it have one. Mostly because he has 3 kids with 2 other ex-wives, 17, 22, and 27 years old. Together, we have our son, 13 months old. 

Whenever I try to learn anything, my husband gets either annoyed, condescending, or makes jokes about my personality. Which is quite literal and matter-of-fact. I'm a warm person, I love deeply and wholly but I also LOVE to learn things and share my knowledge. Some would call me a know it all, I would say I just want people to know what I know (I realize that can be annoying). But, I love to know FACTS and reality, up-to-date ways to do things differently. 

My husband...is the exact opposite. He knows everything already and hates to be told new ways of doing things, by me in particular. That's not to say he doesn't learn new things, he just only does it when he wants to do something in particular like fix something or build something. Otherwise, he rolls his eyes or just stops listening. 

Why is this in the parenting sub? I'm getting there.

When I say he knows everything, this includes how to parent our son. I'm a current full time SAHM (and Master's student, and former Chemist for about 8 years) so I literally dedicate my entire day to my son--learning stuff every day, gathering data (not literally, just giving the idea of how I am) about him and spending what time that I used to be running experiments, now handling the growth and development of our son. 150% all in.

But when problems arise, like transitioning from bottle to sippy/straw/open cup, and I try to talk to my husband about my struggles, he gets upset because he thinks I'm reinventing the wheel by looking up how to teach open cup to a 13mo. I have since given up open cup learning because it was such a big deal between my husband and I. 

I try to explain that onesie pajamas pretty much only come in tight cotton or loose fleece because of fire hazards and he thinks, since fleece is hot as fuck and we run hot at night (as people, not the house, which stays at like 68ish), using tight pajamas is bad, despite my reading that loose non-fire retardant clothing is dangerous. 

My husband refuses to let him go to bed without a bottle despite me knowing from research, and the doc this time, that it's unnecessary at this point. 

With his older kids, he was never around. He's been in the military actively or as a civilian contractor his entire adult life and with that meant going overseas. His oldest was the only one he raised himself and that was almost 30 years ago--shit has changed and updated. 

I bought, albeit probably too many, things to help make life easier throughout the newborn stage. To my husband, they were pointless. But my research 🤓 told me they were useful. And generally, I was right.

My husband is also bipolar. He goes through stages of extreme happiness and then extreme sadness. Happy stage is ""buy whatever you think we need"" I'll be over here obsessing about this new project or new talent I'm trying to master,"" sad stage is ""what the fuck did you get a nose suction tube for? Or a giant flower for the sink? Or what the fuck do we have so many bottles?! I'll be over here thinking my life sucks, my kids hate me, and I'm now extremely unmotivated.""

We get along great, enjoy the same things like going outside, hiking, video games, etc. We have the same parenting views, for the most part, but not all. I tried Ferber, he got worried and felt bad for our son but let me stick to it and now our son sleeps well most of the time (knock on 🪵). Before Ferber, I insisted on complete darkness for naps and he thought I was being dumb but our son slept like shit and I was frantically trying to figure out what to do. Consulted internet experts and he thought that was dumb. But he also had no idea so not sure what the fuck there. I tried to stop rocking our son to sleep because I learned that it could be a crutch  and he thought I was being dumb (it was a crutch and made Ferber that much harder). 

There is so much more that has become less and less because I've just started giving in or not talking about the moves I make during the day.

TLDR I don't appreciate feeling like I'm putting 150% into raising our son and my partner thinking I'm overthinking or doing things that he thinks is stupid or unworthy."

He is remote-only due to a football injury.  His only interaction is with his friends after school.  He has absolutely no thoughts on what he wants to do after high school.  I don't care if he goes to college, junior college, or just works.  I want him to be happy but I also want some direction in his life.  Now, it is to do the bare minimum in school, gaming, and hanging out with his friends.  He is not into drugs or alcohol (it runs in my family so I am very aware), he's very social, he can achieve high grades if he puts in the effort.  But somehow down the road it just doesn't matter to him.  My wife and I have had numerous talks with him.  We try to keep the pressure low but he has 2 years to figure it out and we just want to have an idea of what he wants.  Some of my friends are in the ""let him be, he'll figure it out"", others are ""map a plan for him"".  I am worried about him but don't want to pester him about it all the time.

Northstar_8	2021-04-29 16:11:00+00:00	Questions for parents with children in daycare.	"Long post! 

My 13 month old just started daycare 2 weeks ago. She has been home with my husband her whole life due to covid but he is ready to go back to work. Before she even started daycare I had several issues with the Director of the facility being unorganized, not communicating well, forgetful etc. however I chalked it up to me setting my expectations too high. 

The daycare has video cameras so I can watch my daughter any time which is wonderful but I am seeing very concerning things happening but I’m not sure if I am just being too high maintenance or if this is typical behavior for daycare centers.

Some things I’ve noticed are there are no engaging activities like their website stated they do on a daily basis. The only thing I’ve seen them do “activity wise” is fill a ziplock bag with water and let the kids play with that for a good 10 min. Surprise my daughter bit the plastic bag and they took it from her but didn’t give her anything else to play with.

They allow other children out of their high chairs when they are finished eating and the kids will come to my daughters food and start eating from her plate when she’s still eating, drink from her sippy cup and the teachers do nothing. 

I watched my daughter climb ontop of a stack of cots which had to have been about 4 feet high and she sat up there for a good 2 minutes before attempting to launch herself off head first, thankfully someone finally caught her before she could fall but obviously no one was watching her the whole time. 

Yesterday she came home with a cut and bruise right in the corner of her eye and I was never notified any accidents occurred, they “didn’t see” it happen so we don’t know how hard she was hit or with what. They are supposed to be following up later today about it. 

They send her home completely filthy, clothes covered in food, milk and who knows what else. I had to wipe yogurt out from her ear the other day. 

Teachers will blow their nose and not wash their hands and immediately go touch the children or serve them food. Absolutely disgusting.I’ve also brought this up and I was told they would address it but nothings changed.

The director constantly states they are severely understaffed which does not make me feel any better about what is all going on it makes me feel like they don’t have the resources to properly care for the children. 

I’d like some input from other parents if this stuff happens at other daycares and I’m just being too high maintenance or if I need to find another place for her to go. Childcare is very hard to find right now where I live so I don’t want to pull her out unless absolutely necessary. I also don’t want to leave her there waiting for something horrible to happen. Thanks!"

beigs	2021-04-29 15:26:42+00:00	Can a person die from only getting 3 hours of sleep a night?	"I’m actually serious 

I have 3 under 5, and my husband has been away on and off for work for over a month. By the time I have laundry done, dishes cleaned, toys put away, etc. I sit down for lunch/dinner at 10pm and fold laundry until midnight. Shower, bed at 1-2 depending if the baby wakes up and how many times, then my middle son wakes everyone up at 5:30-6:30. 

We have the color wake up clock, but my 2 year old just doesn’t sleep. He falls asleep at 8 regardless of what time I put him to sleep, and won’t nap. He screams like he’s being murdered if I put him down mid day at this point, and it usually results in the baby waking up from his nap. 

This means that I average 3-4 hours of sleep a night.

Will this kill me before June? 

We’re in lockdown again in my province, so we don’t have help"

He’s recently taken an interest to cooking so we’ve been talking about flavor profiles, kitchen safety, food hygiene, techniques, how to properly clean cast iron vs nonstick... He’s soaking it all up and has been volunteering to do a lot of the cooking for the family. It even gets his little brother (6) excited to help.

I’m just super proud of him for learning, and it’s good to know he’ll be able to survive on his own one day without relying on microwaves and takeout."
HappyAsHappyCanBe89	2021-04-29 14:45:56+00:00	Any advice please - How to stop overthinking and getting emotional?	"Hi all. I've just joined this sub. I've been active on other subs. 



I'm a 32 year old mother to a lovely 4 year old boy. He will be 5 this year. It's looking very likely that my son is on the autisic spectrum. He shows some red flags but not an overwhelming amount. Diagnosis is imminent (he's been getting assessed for over 2 years). He is mostly non verbal (3 words) but his understanding and social skills are good (social skills slightly lacking). 




We currently have help in the form of a private speech therapist and this is helping a lot. She guides me on the best activities and interaction to carry out with my son and she also praises me (I know that sounds stupid but sometimes when you don't get a thank you or an I love you from your child, someone telling you you're doing great is a big boost). 




I have a really strong bond with my son. He is my only child and will be my only child. He also has a strong bond with his dad (my husband). We are family of 3 with a cat and we are for the most part, very happy. 




One thing that is making me unhappy is my overthinking and worry. When I'm playing with my son and doing everyday things, I'm in the moment and it's all great. When night time or alone time rolls around though, I just become overwhelmed with worry about the future for him. Will he talk, will he make friends, will he be independent as an adult etc. Sometimes it leads to me looking through photo albums of pictires of him and crying. I bounce back of course but I feel this is a very negative thing that I do. I have recently started to worry about when I pass away and so does my husband, who will be there for him. Thinking about him alone breaks my heart. 




It probably doesn't help that my wider family is dysfunctional. I have a great relationship with my mum, stepdad and sister 1. However I have no relationship with my dad and sisters 2 and 3. This is mutual, my mum, stepdad and sister 1 don't have a relationship with my dad and sister 2 and 3. Let's just say there's some personality disorders or something going on with those 3 and maintaining a relationship is impossible. This is relevant because my husband is an only child and most of the cousins are mothered by sister 2 and 3 so I feel at some point, my son will have no one. This is very irrational isn't it? Does anyone have any advice about how I can stop my mind going there? Live is for living right? My son will only be young once. Whilst these thoughts and worries don't affect my parenting or quality time with my son, it affects me. 




It's also came to light recently that I suffer from a medical condition (an allergy condition) and testing has resulted in me now being allergic to several things (I never had any allergies before) and I'll need to be on medication and carry an auto injector for the rest of my life and a couple of these allergies are unavoidable and severe but can be controlled with medication hopefully. It doesn't impact my general health now I have medication but it makes me think that I could one day have a severe reaction and not make it (unlikely but by now you tell overthink!). 




Sorry for the rambling guys. Does anyone have any advice for me? I currently take 1 St John's wort daily which helps a lot. I think it's more my emotions I need to get a hold of. I feel lately I cry (on my own when no one else is around) more often than is normal. 



Thank you very much for reading."

"Should a child (aged 10) be forced to practice and be threatened to be kicked off a team (billiards) because they are playing something for fun and socialization? The team is majority just family with his dad as the captain. It is his dad's passion and he asked if our son wanted to play for fun. Of course our son wanted to join to play with his family. (Dad is captain, grandmother, her SO) Our son has fun with it but its not his passion like it is for them. When he does practice it is because he is forced. We spend every single Sunday at the pool hall for league and now he goes twice a week during the week given no option. My husband and I disagree and of course his mother and her boyfriend also agree with him. If he doesn't play to get better, win, and to do cash tournaments then he will not be allowed to play at all.

Illustrious-Music-61	2021-04-29 13:23:35+00:00	How to reach an agreement on meals?	"One my child (16M) said he is tired of eating ""Chinese"" food and wants to eat more ""normal"" food like other people, my wife who runs a Chinese restaurant is not willing to cook any other stuff and neither am I, so I said he is old enough to cook any other cuisine he wants and he got somewhat annoyed. 
After this initial discussion, his twin volunteered to cook for him because he really likes cooking, but I forbade him to be sole cooker as he already helps out more at home, I said he could teach him how to cook and then they can alternate who is cooking because he can't rely on another person making meals for him, this only got him even more annoyed saying ""If he likes to cook, I should just let him cook for both"" and stormed off. 
In this situation, what  you guys think is the best solution?"
Getsome4000	2021-04-29 13:09:40+00:00	So my son let himself out in a thunderstorm in the middle of the night...	"Our son is 4 and has been waking up in the night and coming out of his room lately. Up to now it has mostly been just him popping in our bedroom or like drawing himself a bath or something but this morning after him up and down all night, etc. I see a pile of his PJs and his night diaper in front of the backdoor. I asked him and he stripped down naked and let himself out in the thunderstorm at like 4 AM!!!!??!? 

I flipped. Probably more than necessary but I was freaked out and didn't know how to convey the severity of the importance of - at minimum - staying in the house at night and def when it's raining. Which leads me to my question: How do we effectively combat this without mentally messing him up? I know that locking him in his room for bed is a fire hazard as well as not great for him psychologically but dutch doors are a no-go because he would climb that easy as can be. Any advice/tips are appreciated thanks if you got this far!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - 4 Y/O gets out of bed at night, takes off jammies and lets himself into the backyard during a thunderstorm around like 4 in the morning - no lock/dutch doors as those are easily defeated"
Reddituser1234568905	2021-04-29 12:55:06+00:00	My son is driving me crazy and I feel terrible about it	"My son is a couple days away from being 9 months old, and he is driving me absolutely insane. The last couple of days he has been soooo clingy so I am not able to get any cleaning or anything done (he's crawling and always under my feet) and he just isn't sleeping, usually he takes a 2-3 hour nap around noon and he won't lay down but is crabby and tired all day, and just won't stop crying. He usually sleeps 12ish hours at night, and now hes sleeping considerably less. I suspected he is teething and gave him tylenol but it didn't help at all. The sleep thing wouldn't be such a big deal if he wasn't actually tired but he shows all of HIS specific signs that he is (he shakes his head back and forth, rubs his eyes, yawning, and then the dangerous one is he just throws his head around and doesn't care if he hits it on something until of course after the fact and he's hurt himself, I've asked the doc about this and seeing if maybe we can get him tested for something, because autism runs in my husband's family  but it's too early). He woke up at 5:30 this morning and I am not a morning person and he was just screaming in his crib, I tried to wait to see if he would lay down because I knew he wasn't hungry because he had been fed only 2 hours prior at 3am, so I watched on the baby monitor until about 6 and then went in there and was extremely aggravated and yelling (not like screaming or anything just like raised my voice a bit) and I've been getting so aggravated like this the last couple of days and I just feel horrible about it. My husband and I tried for so long and went through multiple losses to have my baby and I always thought I was meant to be a mom, but now I'm not so sure. I'm terrified of being like my mom, she was unnurturing and unloving and I don't want to be like that, but I just don't think I'm as cut out for this as I thought and I feel absolutely horrible for it. I honestly just needed somewhere to post this and get it off my chest..."
MissTiffanieAnne	2021-04-29 12:41:37+00:00	At the end of my rope with 10 year old	"He is constantly lying. Like, daily. I literally just busted him first thing in the morning, saying he had cereal when he didn't. He put milk and water in a bowl. Why?
It's little things. He went through an elaborate setup the other day to fake making a sandwich instead of just eating bread. I wouldn't have been mad if he said he just had bread; the fact that he thinks he can get away with this stuff is infuriating. It's getting to the point where I don't want to talk to him because it becomes a game of ""find the truth in the lies"". 
He's destructive as well. He's been grounded from everything for a while because he keeps making bad decisions. I guess boredom caused him to peel the paint off his wall. I get it, I would probably be mad and bored too but really? It's not a cheap fix. 
I had to sacrifice my school laptop and set it up so he can only access school websites. Idk why school-provided chromebooks aren't set up that way. He was getting into websites he definitely should not have been. He's doing better but still lying about completing his work. Again I get that it is the end of the year and we are all low on motivation. Just do the stuff and get it over with. He has nothing else to do since he's constantly grounded. 
My other child is a Saint in comparison. Complains sometimes, but does her work and doesn't lie. Idk what I've done wrong with him but it's beyond frustrating. If he's acting like this now, idk what will happen when he's a teen. 
I'm taking him to therapy starting next week. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to help ease the pain and frustration from these situations? He tells me he lies to avoid getting in trouble, but it takes more time to construct these lies than it would take to just do what he's supposed to. I'm really at a loss and any advice would help."

lync111515	2021-04-29 12:06:54+00:00	"My 10 month old refuses to eat solids, help!"	"I have a beautiful 10 month old baby boy. He’s hitting all his milestones perfectly except when it comes to eating finger foods. 

We had an incident a couple months ago where he choked on a puff. He was just beginning to put food into his mouth and having fun with it. He has not even attempted eating since that day! 

I’ve tried everything to get him to eat puffs and Cheerios. I’ve resorted to putting it into his mouth, between his teeth so he’ll chew it, or attempt to. He pukes every time food enters his mouth. Not with puréed baby food. He’ll eat that 3 times a day, reluctantly. He tries to dodge every bite unless it’s something he really likes. I’ve tried giving him a variety of different foods and he just becomes more and more upset. It’s almost like he has a phobia when it comes to food. He’s very interested in what I’m eating so I try to give him bites and he turns his head every time. So I hand him bites sometimes. He observes it then drops it and moves on. 

I asked his doctor what to do, he was no help. He said he would probably be eating in the next couple months. He said that last time... he said he may need speech therapy to learn how to eat but I don’t think I can afford it. I think he’s just scared of puking because so far that’s what always happens when he eats anything. 

Anyone else had this problem or is familiar with speech therapy in toddlers? Any solutions are much appreciated!"

acity4ever	2021-04-29 11:03:25+00:00	Baby feeding help	"TLDR: my baby (2.5 months, girl) hasn't had a good latch while breastfeeding and cannot pull from a bottle.  Advice appreciated on how we can prove latching and bottle pulling.

In the hospital after birth, someone said my baby had a good latch on my wife.  Can't remember if that was the lactation person or just a regular nurse...   Anyways we have had major issues getting her on the bottle - she refuses to suck on it.  She'll just play a bit and get frustrated.  Tried different temperatures, different people, wife leaving the house, different bottles and nipples (6 different bottles), tried different positions, tried bouncing, etc...  Baby doesn't like to suck from a finger and won't take a pacifier.

Saw a lactation specialist Tuesday and they said it's a poor latch and also they think she has a high palate.  She said the baby is only getting the foremilk from breasts and no hindmilk because she hasn't been pulling much if at all.  She's really only getting the letdown.  This explains why she feeds so often still (like once an hour).  She will sleep for like 3 or 4 hours at night one time but then be up every hour to feed cause she's hungry cause she gets enough to last her that long apparently. We made an appointment for next Tuesday with a speech specialist who apparently can help with latch and also an ENT doctor in a few weeks.  

We are using a 10mL feeding syringe to get some hindmilk into baby for now... Also have tried a small medicine cup and that seems like it could work (tried it once).  But I'd like to see latch improvement and bottle pulls improvement ideally.  Is that feasible now and how?"
dextermorgansnanny	2021-04-29 10:26:13+00:00	Send prayers.	"Don’t use my story for anything. Period. 

Y’all say a prayer or send good vibes. My family member called me Monday night to ask if i could keep her youngest who’s three. He’s got serious “i don’t like to listen issues” and i asked if i could take one of the other siblings because it’s WAY easier to put him to bed and keep an eye on him at night if i do. I’ve got a 5 month old myself. Well. Siblings had school so i couldn’t have one of them. 

He went to bed about seven thirty and screamed for his iPad for TWO hours. I’m talking holy crap devil inside me screaming but the issue is our internet was having and area outage so he just had to deal
With it. I woke up about six and he was in the livingroom. I assumed he’d just gotten up. Nope. I just now woke up again (second night with me) at four thirty, went out there to check on him in our middles room (they’re at moms) and he’s sitting on my couch. He’s been up god knows how long. I put him back to bed screaming, kicking and crying again. 

His behavior is just through the roof bad and i have kept her older two for years with no issues. I’ve never met a kid who was able to stress me out this much. I’m laying in bed right now crying because during the day it’s constant attention seeking behavior from him.  

His mom was an amazing mom up until last year when her husband found out she was having an affair. It came out that she was likely suffering severe ppd and mental health issues (she’s aware this is no excuse and that’s not what this post is about.) and it was triggered by the birth of her youngest (this kid.)

Since then she’s been sort of absent and her 14 year old has taken over as pseudo mother because their dad travels for work. Like my cousin is home, just not present. It breaks my heart for this kid because when he’s sweet he’s so good. But my god. My nerves are absolutely shot, my usually neat house is a WRECK, and my own kid seems to be in the worst mood because of the constant screaming and kicking. Last night my insanely calm baby had an absolute meltdown until i took her out of my house. My dogs hide. My boyfriend lets me handle the kid and it got so bad that even he said something to him about his behavior in an attempt to correct it and give me a break. 

I love him but he needs so much more attention at home. I cannot keep him until this behavior breaks. I am literally counting down the seconds until his mom comes to get him. I feel so fucking bad about it too."

This is a letter to all of those planning to have kids one day but are still living a life kids-free: 

Dear person with all the time in the world.
I recommend that you take some extra time and enjoy your peaceful beautiful life! I recommend that you take a loooong shower, use some body scrub while you listen to your favourite music or even better, that 1 hour long podcast about how to focus and better your mental health! Also really just enjoy that you can go to the bathroom at any time you want and need. Invite some friends for dinner later and cook ANYTHING you’d like! Spicy food, a lot of onions (!!!), all kinds of veggies that you like and get your favorite wine, get two or three bottles so you have enough to drink some of it while cooking in PEACE! Enjoy an uninterrupted dinner with your friends and discuss the content of the podcast you listened to earlier and enjoy the fact that all your attention is on this one specific topic that you are discussing as these free human beings you all are. And don’t worry if it gets late, you have all the time in the world to sleep in tomorrow only to be woken up by birds singing outside your window at 11AM!!!
When your guests leave then take your time cleaning up or maybe just leave it for tomorrow cause you have all the time in the world and I kind of feel like you should be enjoying it more than you actually are! 

That’s it from me. If some of you have something you want to add to this letter feel free !!"

(TW: death, pet death)"	"Background: My (32F) mom and dad have a dog who is 13 years old, and has been showing signs of illness for a few months. After rapid weight loss and lots of testing, we found out a few weeks ago that he has cancer. Although I live separately from my parents now, I still lived with my parents and their dog for 7 years, only moving out about 6 years ago. It’s been tough on everyone knowing that he’s so sick, especially my mom. She made the decision to have him euthanized tomorrow, as it’s clear he is slowing down and now losing muscle tone. Friends and family have been over to visit my parents and say their goodbyes because he is such a beloved companion. Both of my children love him as we visit frequently and he makes visits to our house too. 

I have been lucky so far not to have a death in the family since my oldest (4M) has been able to understand and recognize a person/beings absence in his life. I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to kindly and gently bring it up that the dog won’t be around anymore. I’d love to be as honest with him as possible, and I have an idea of what I’d say, though I worry because he’s a sensitive kid. How should I begin this conversation with my son?

Platina4k	2021-04-29 07:11:13+00:00	Playground advise for very sociable kid	"Since our kindergarden is closed at the moment and for the foreseeable future, my son longs for social contacs his age. All we can do is go to playgrounds, when they are not too full. 

Now he is very sociable and we taught him our understanding of playground manners. Like ""the playground belongs to everyone"", ""we wait until its our turn"" or ""if you want to play with others' toys, ask first"".

But sometimes they are groups of kids, who play very differently and mean. When he approaches them and asks to take a turn or play together, he gets a ""no"" or even gets shooed away. Which of course upsets him, even though he can take a no for an answer without being totally out of it.

The only explanation and teaching I can think of in such situations is to tell him to except that and play on his own. Or we play together instead. But he picks up these behavior of course. And I wonder, how I can teach him to be more self sustaining. He always seems to take this kind of rejection to heart and wonders, what might be the reason others don't want to play with him.

What do you say to your kids in such situations and make them feel they are worthy of friendship and kindness? I would like him to be resilient to such experiences."

Hey all, 

Any recommendations for post injections grumps? Mine just had his four month shots. My baby is fine with sucking the bottle and cuddles during his actual injection and having a bit of a cry, but for the next 24-48 hours he's absolutely miserable. We've been giving him cuddles on demand and he's basically latched himself on to his daddy like a limpet all day today but he's still miserable, fragile and easily frustrated most of today and almost inconsolable at times. 

He was like this for his six week ones as well and I'm already dreading his six month ones.

At the moment we're just doing cuddles but what works for you?

Long baths? Would that sting the sites? Massages around the area?"
PantsOfThanos	2021-04-29 05:48:51+00:00	10yo anxiety	"My 10yo boy has developed a crushing anxiety problem. It’s been on and off for a couple of years and just thought he was “a worrier”, didnt really get in the way of life - but now is causing him extreme worry, loss of appetite, tears, and scared to go to school or be in public for fear of panic attacks or bursting into tears in front of people. Hasn’t been to school for a few days now due to the panic. It seems to be irrationally centred around the thought of us (parents) dying and him generally “failing at life” - seems to be an overwhelming fear of bad things in the future when he’s grown up.

"I used to be very well behaved as a child and would always respect what adults told me to do, so I am trying to raise my daughter that way too, as adults obviously know more about what kids should do than the kids themselves. However, her dad thinks that at this age, I should give her more slack because she’s too young to understand. I on the other hand think he’s too soft and cannot discipline or direct her properly. He gets irritated when I tell her no a bit too firmly, like yesterday when she was throwing food all over the couch he accused me of “yelling” when I tried to stop her. I just told her a firm no and took the plate away from her. Recently, she started to throw a fit about brushing her teeth, which tonight resulted in me brushing her teeth while she layer on the bathroom floor throwing a tantrum. Her dad was upset about it, saying she’s not even two years old and doesn’t understand why she needs to brush her teeth. For me that’s exactly the reason why I wouldn’t compromise on that - she doesn’t understand that it’s important in a first place! So am I being too harsh? Or dad is too soft? Or is there a middle ground in such toddler battles?"
GhostlySilence	2021-04-29 04:10:46+00:00	Random things my brother (8) has said	"As I was helping him with putting his pjs on he said ""this is cutting my circulation"" I asked him what that meant and he said ""that I cannot do a circle"" and proceded to try to turn into a ball.
A few moments later we were saying to him that everyone had a little tummy (because he said that he was fat, which isn't bad, but would be a lie because he is really skinny) and without missing a beat he said ""mum doesn't have a little, she has a lot"" and literally fell into the bed laughing. 
I love this kid. 
Also if you are asking why this is in parenting, it's because I'm helping my mum to raise him."

I am a single parent to a 2.5 year old daughter who cries every single time I leave her with my parents for work. I try to be as compassionate as possible and explain to her daily that mummy has to go to work today. I tell her that I will play with her as soon as I come back and that I love her so much. She nods in the moment when I talk to her but as soon as I go to leave, she is clinging to me and crying. It makes it so difficult for the both of us! Does anyone have any suggestions for this?

Thanks in advance!"

My best friend recently gave birth to her kid, and she's been feeling as if she has a major loss of identity. Unfortunately for her, she's the only one in our circle with a kid too right now. I'm really worried for her mental health and between the limitations of the pandemic and being far away from her- how can I be supportive right now? What can I say to her/how can I support or assist. I guess for anyone who's been through this, what did you wish to hear/receive? Or what helped ease this transition? I don't want to talk at her. I want to hold space, ensure that she's heard and be there to validate/give feedback as much as I can."

She likes to admire mine (I just wears studs, nothing fancy). Personally I'm not a fan of babies with earrings, because they didn't choose that. I got my ears pierced when I was 7ish, then repierced plus secondary piercings when I was 10ish after the other holes closed up. I don't want to sound braggy, but our kid is awesome with needles (last time she got her blood drawn she didn't even flinch or make a peep), and she's super smart. So I think if she knew not to pull on the earrings, she'd be gentle with them. Any thoughts on if this is an okay or a terrible idea?"

So, obviously, they know it's frowned upon because they only do it when they think they have privacy. I have a nanny cam and sometimes they'll tattle on each other so that's how I know. (They are aware of the nanny cam, it's not hidden but they don't really acknowledge it as ME watching even though I've flat out told them) 

Any suggestions for how to teach them not to do that as a way to solve inter-personal arguments or should I just let it slide?"

tealambert	2021-04-29 00:03:22+00:00	Too old to believe in the tooth fairy?	"My 10 year old daughter came home today with questions about the tooth fairy and I’m a little upset. Obviously I knew this day would come, but I always figured it would be some other kid who burst her bubble. Instead, she tells me it was her teacher. Apparently her teacher used the tooth fairy as an example of a myth. 

It just bother me that her teacher used the tooth fairy as an example. It seems to me, there could be hundreds of other things she could have used. After the last year our kids have had, couldn’t they just have a little bit longer in believing in the magic? Is it reasonable to tell a class full of 9-10 year olds that the tooth fairy, and subsequently Santa, Easter bunny, etc, are myths?"

We are slowly inching towards more normal. We are allowing some activities. My 15 year old dances and is back to in person but only goes twice a week. That is his only face-to-face gathering with people outside of our house. We are allowing them to hang out with friends as long as it is outside. This weekend my 14 year old spent the day at the park with friends and came back to our house to play basketball with some friends after. My 9 year old is having outdoor playdates and is going to a birthday party this weekend. The 15 year old has always been on the more introverted side but we are going on a year now of him being in school online. Is this kind of isolation something to worry about? We enocuraged him to invite friends over all weekend since it was beautiful out but he said he didn't want to."

Niloklives	2021-04-28 23:19:59+00:00	10 month old started talking and then stopped	"We have a 10 month old boy who is very bright eyes and curious.  He sometimes gets so distracted by the things he sees he forgets he's being fed.  He has been trying to talk for months, even audibly saying ""hi"" at 6 months.

He's ten months old now and the ""Hi""s are gone, he used to babble, but thats mostly stopped, at 9 months he even started sayong ""dada"" ""bubba""(his nickname) and ""chicken""(pronounced ""ticken"").  All that has stopped too. We used to reliably get him to repeat the words he was picking up if we said them a couple times. Example: ""bubbabubbabubba"" would get a response of ""bababababa"" now we get no verbal response, though he still turns and smiles.

On occasion he does seem to replicate sounds. Yesterday he looked at me wide eyed and said ""oooooooh"" when I said ""woooah"" which I got him to repeat a few times, but we have recordings of him saying ""hi"" clear as a bell from 4 months ago which we always positively responded to; smiling, laughing, saying hi back, talking to him more, etc. So the fact that he seems to almost ""forget"" is a bit alien to us.

This is our first child, so we're definitely learning as we go.  I'm trying to convince myself and my wife that this is just a phase within his learning process, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried he was regressing somehow.

Does anyone have any insight?

Thanks in advance"

He plays Minecraft, Roblox or watches videos of people playing these games on YouTube. When weekend comes around we are all excited to go out walking, or biking or whatever and he would just get upset because he doesn't want to go out unless it's to a local playpark or some familiar place. I got him to try football &amp; tennis but he doesn't like them. He used to do karate at school club but that's all shut due to pandemic. He says he likes running so I've put his name for a running club and they have a year long waiting list!

LuckyBunny0908	2021-04-28 22:37:11+00:00	I’m at my wits end with 6 year olds attitude.	"My six year old is smart and clever and well rounded socially. But she has an attitude I cannot believe. I think I do well taking most things with a grain of salt but to me this is getting out of hand. Not long ago she told me while she was angry that I “loved her brother more than her”. While I know kids say things in anger, I did try to hear her and acknowledge her feelings. So I set aside some time to make it all about her. I reassured her, paid more attention to how I interact with both of them and set aside activities and time devoted to her completely.

 But her behavior has not improved. Any type of discipline or even just telling her what to do results in eye rolling, silent treatment, stomping, crying or her snapping at me. I have tried discussing with her using her words, the purpose of responsibility, the dynamic of me being a parent and helping her learn to be independent, etc. But emotionally I’m so drained I could cry. I feel like I can’t discipline her with any purpose because she just shuts down. Like she isn’t learning anything. If I implement consequences she will have a fit. But even just telling her it’s her turn to take a bath first will result in a night of silent treatment and glares.

I know deep down I should ignore it, but it is exhausting to be treated so bad and feel like I’m not teaching her anything. 

Her dad says she responds better to softer tones and “asking rather than telling” her to do something. But I think it does her a disservice to coddle her. 

My family says it’s a “girl thing” but my two sisters were terrors and that’s all I see when I look at her behavior. I just need advice"
AngelHoneyGoldfish	2021-04-28 22:09:39+00:00	2yo is having a hard time adjusting to new sis and being away from her daddy. Advice?	"A little background so that you get the whole picture:

My husband and I just had our 2nd daughter in March. We did everything we could to prepare our 2yo (baby doll, books about being a big sister, talking to her about it, taking her to ultrasound apts, etc) but she has had a very hard time adjusting. She definitely showed regression in the first month:  refusing naps, nightmares, screaming and other attention seeking behaviors that I had never seen before. Besides the nightmares, her bedtime routine and night sleep hasn’t changed. She’s a great nighttime sleeper.

Now keep in mind, for the last month, I have been spending more time with the baby and my husband has been spending more time with our 2yo because I am constantly nursing, but I do give her 1 on 1 time as much as possible. This has been difficult for her to see mom give the baby so much attention, but she also enjoys the time with her dad because she’s always been a daddy’s girl.

5 days ago, my husband returned to work. For those 5 days, my daughter hasn’t refused her naps and has overall been pretty good and back to normal. Today was my husband’s first day back off from work and our daughter is back to refusing her naps and acting out. During nap time, she cries for her daddy. He has tried reading to her, rubbing her back until she’s calm, and laying on the floor by her bed until she falls asleep. No luck. 

It seems like she has separation anxiety from her daddy?  She doesn’t act like this when he leaves for work but acts like this when he is home. What can we do to help her and support her?  I feel so bad for the stress my little girl is feeling."
ocean_preneur	2021-04-28 21:59:05+00:00	Raising a Child in a City vs a Small Town?	"I'm unfortunately going through a divorce. My ex is saying she's going to relocate with our toddler from here in Victoria BC up to a small town (Courtenay BC).

Being that I'm in Victoria as is 10+ other family members in my boy's life, I'm biased.

I'd still like to know... **What are YOUR thoughts on raising a child in a small city vs a small town?**

Personally, I love Victoria for many reasons, one of which is that it's a city with many academic and career opportunities BUT it's still not a ""big city"". It has a small town feel to it and plenty of nature in and around it.  

I've been to Courtenay multiple times and while I love the nature there too, I'm not so sure if it will provide the same opportunities for children who grow up there.

Plus, I've read recent (last year or two) reports that say Courtenay is the most dangerous place to live in BC and 7th most dangerous in Canada.

It has a Crime Severity Index (CSI) of 119 vs the average in Canada of 70."
billy_the_kid16	2021-04-28 21:53:10+00:00	Anti-vaxx “friend” making me feel especially uncomfortable at 8 months pregnant.	"Sorry if this is the wrong place for this. 

To start I’m (30f) and currently 8 months pregnant. I live in a pretty close knit community, and since becoming pregnant I’ve made a plethora of friends (they used to be acquaintances, but since getting pregnant apparently that means I’m “worthy” of their friendship I guess) I actually like the upswing in friends because making friends is hard as you get older, and most of them have young children/toddlers/babies, or are actually pregnant themselves, so it could be good socialization for my daughter, and things to do this summer. 

One mom has a “mommy blog” via Instagram that’s filled with spreading disinformation. I’m not at all anti-vaxx and I believe in modern medicine/science. She’s constantly sending me bogus links that have no reliable sources, and is constantly badgering me about having a hospital birth.  I don’t know if everyone in the “mommy group” feels the same, or just doesn’t say anything but maybe since I’m younger and pregnant she feels like taking me under her wing or something? 

Anyway my MIL is actually a ER physician, this girl either chooses to ignore that and still spread her dislike for modern medicine. My thing is should I bother saying something? Tell her to “back off” and risk losing the new friendship, or just let her continue? How would one handle this? I also don’t want my baby to get sick in the future because her child I’m willing to bet isn’t vaccinated, any tips from a seasoned parent?

We were waiting after (obligatory 15 min wait to check you’re all good) and my son was just stood up in front of me looking around and asking questions. 

He then looked behind me and said “mummy?” very quietly, when I asked him what he needed he said, again very softly “why has that lady got a baddie on her face?” I subtly looked around and he was referring to another member of staff with a large birthmark on her face. I explained what it was and he was happy with the answer and moved on.

If he doesn't like a meal he cries and tells us all done! 
Today at lunch he didn't want anything I offered him and it turned into a tantrum. I decided to sit down on the floor with his food and take a bite. My son noticed and came to sit with me and started eating his applesauce because I had taken a bite. We then moved on to raspberries where I would take a bite out of one and he would finish it. I even got him to eat a few pieces of sandwich before he decided he really didn't like the sandwich. This is the first time in months I've seen him eat raspberries! It's almost impossible to get him to try even a bite usually but he just sat and took turns eating little bits with me. It was such a relief to make some progress!"

At first I thought it was a from about unknown food allergy, but I don't think thats it. The food she ate was a common dish we eat often.. I did have atopic dermatitis when I was a young - toddler to almost adulthood- but most of it was based on food and environment....for her, the conditions have not changed - we use the same detergent, soap, her diet has not changed, I dust and air out the house often.  I don't think its seasonal with no runny nose, or itchy throat, no fever. In fact up to this point shes been very hardy, hardly getting sick...

I can see the response already about telling her straight and boundaries, but ladies and gents, those work for people who RESPECT boundaries. As much as she can be a delight to be around 'mother knows best' with this woman sometimes. We agree on some parenting aspects and are polar opposite on others.

I had a traumatic birth with PTSD, mix in that I have trust issues and anxiety, the idea of another makes me freeze up. Not to mention that I got laid off due to covid and now working self-employed to help with bills, using our second bedroom as an office, we're tight on money and space.

She's been hinting at 'we should have another for a year now' and more or less came out and said it when they popped round last weekend. We shot it down with 'we have no money 

but... I know this woman, she's going to give us financial advice next time we meet to persuade us, I know it. This is what she does. You say no, she doubles down. When she can't convince us both, she'll pull my husband aside and try and convince him. If I give my 2 cents, especially with parenting tactics that differ, we'll be undermined and spoken to like children that need to be instructed. This happened in all topics! Conform!

My husband has learnt to fake compliance and go his own way when they're not looking, something I've adopted just for them since they HOUND you to conform. 

It's funny because my own mother who can be a bit emotional manipulative I have great boundaries with, if she crosses the line, I tell her. She pouts but we're good in a day or two. We have a better relationship now than we did in my teens. I feel we've grown to respect each other as adults and just wish we could that with my in law's."
usernametaken4times	2021-04-28 20:53:37+00:00	Our very taciturn (but lovely) daughter	"Long. Thanks for reading!

I need help with my four year old daughter. Just for the background - I also have a 2 year old son and my daughter was a preemie born at 25 weeks. She did well in the NICU and overall doing okay. Both me and my husband work full time from home. 

I have the following concerns. We feel that my daughter is somewhat behind on emotional development.

She screams for everything that doesn't go her way, which means multiple times a day. We have been patient, tried to talk to her during calm times but we haven't made any progress. It is not crying but a loud scream for every small thing that doesn't go her way. She attends a preschool and doesn't talk about her preschool or about her with us. The teacher says she is a quiet kid and even at home, she doesn't share anything that happened in school. Even if we ask her questions, she doesn't want to discuss that. I feel I am not able to connect to her. We also don't have any family close as we are immigrants. I feel her behaviour and her not able to share things with us are related? 


We have tried speech evaluation at our school district but assessing her vocabulary she doesn't qualify for a therapy. Are there any therapies available to help a situation like this? What do we need to do better as a parent to connect with her? Please show us some path! Thanks!"
onwardnow	2021-04-28 20:49:33+00:00	"Teenage son (16M) addicted to video games/screens now has ""headaches"" &amp; does nothing"	"Backstory:  Son 16M always loved gaming.  His older sister bought him a PS4 several years as a gift and he had an iPhone for several years too.  Wasn't really a problem until last year before the pandemic started.  Then he started missing school because he wasn't feeling well, was hard to wake up, seemed moody, etc.  We finally figured out that it was because he wasn't going to bed at a good time, staying up late playing games or watching stuff on his phone.  Grades started to suffer as a result too.  The pandemic hit and he pretty much gave up on school for the rest of the semester, only doing the bare minimum.  Summer came &amp; we didn't change things up too much.  His mother &amp; I  are divorced and he spends part of the week with me and part of the week with her.  

In the fall, we decided to keep him home &amp; do homeschooling because of the pandemic.  That only lasted a month or so before he fell back on his old habits.  I grounded him from his PS4 &amp; Switch.  His iPhone had broken by this point so he didn't have a cellphone any longer.  We had been working with a therapist for my grandson so we talked to her about my son.  She suggested that he start earning back his privileges but he had to admit to what caused the loss of his privileges and come up with ways to earn them back.  He refused.  I have shared custody with my ex-wife.  She thought I was too strict and only went along with the grounding from video games.  While he is with her, she was still letting him watch TV.  And he was the one that was manipulating her into letting him stay home from school for the most part.  He missed the most school when he was with her and barely missed when he was with me.  

After that start of the New Year, he claimed he had a headache that never went away.  That made it to where he couldn't do any schoolwork at all, so he claims.  Took him to doctors &amp; a headache specialist and didn't find anything medically wrong.  Started prescribing some meds to try to get rid of the headaches but nothing has really worked (or so he claims).  Mostly still on a messed up sleep schedule despite us telling him he needed to try to go to bed at a decent time, etc.  I just found out that he's been sneaking video games by playing on a Gameboy he had (that I forgot about).  Because he's been getting away with that, that's why I figured he didn't care to earn back his screen time.  

Now I'm also suspect about his headaches.  Whether he actually has them or if they are as bad as he says they are.  He refuses to go to therapy.  I mean, right now, he pretty much has gotten his way.  He does zero schoolwork, watches TV at his mom's, and apparently now has been been playing gameboy when he's over here, and just sleeping weird hours.  

Because of the lying and hiding his habit, or just finding another ""fix"", I'm afraid that he'll just find something else to do once I take his gameboy away.  And forcing him to keep his door open, only allowing him in his room to sleep, etc, is that really going to solve anything?  Just looking for ideas on how to deal with this.  His mom thinks I'm too strict and also suffers from chronic pain herself, so she tends to go easier on him.  And as a result, he would just rather stay with her than come over to my place when I'm supposed to have him.  

I don't know if he's too prideful or ashamed to admit when he's messed up.  And that's why he refuses to talk to someone else or even try to earn his screen privileges back.  He also feels he's treated unfairly because his older brother had way more freedom in that we didn't regulate his screen use as much, but he was getting good grades, working a job, and having extracurriculars.  I've told my son that he would have the same freedom but he would have to show me he could be responsible too.  And clearly his addiction to screens was affecting the rest of his life.  

Is it time for even more hard love and more punishments/monitoring?  I can monitor him when I'm awake but all bets are off when I'm in bed or when he's over at his mom's.  We've tried to get him to do other things with us but he refuses for the most part."
shydeadgirl90	2021-04-28 20:36:55+00:00	Kid gets a stomach ache when doing things they don't want to do.	"So for example after lunch today we had to run an errand. (stopping by my office to drop off paperwork) kiddo started complaining that they had to go potty as I got on the freeway. We pulled off went potty and got back in the car. I asked them if they were good to go and they started gaging and saying their stomach hurts. So I drove home and they put themselves to bed. 
What is causing this behavior? They've done it on our way to dinner, a their friends house, really anything they don't want to do."
caroline_	2021-04-28 20:04:21+00:00	Bath time mischief 😩	"Hello, obviously I know this problem is extremely bottom tier but please humor me. My kids (4.5y boy, 21m girl) go absolutely nuts at bath time and it drives me and their dad a little crazy. My daughter has seen her brother do everything from slurping water to sucking on washcloths to chewing on rubber toys or plastic balls and so she does it too. My anxiety is mainly that she'll end up choking on something (AND frankly I'm grossed out by them drinking the water they're bathing in). We've managed to get my son to stop a lot of that, but it's next to impossible to get the toddler to follow suit (obviously!). 

I just want a calmer bath time routine. Half the time my son starts the mischief but then gets upset when the baby takes it too far and splashes him in the face repeatedly (or something). 

I'm wondering if other parents here have found themselves overwhelmed by the mischief and chaos your children cause during bath time and if you've found strategies for it? Orrrr this is my life for as long as I've got two kids sharing a bath?

cheers 😌"
d0mback3n	2021-04-28 19:54:24+00:00	How do I separate myself from my brother and sister?	"So growing up I was in charge of my brother and sister as my parents work 24/7 and were always too tired. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its to the point where I was basically their father (went to parent teacher conf's, and did as much as I could, I basically sacrificed my entire childhood, teens, and now half of my later 20's. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was trying to help my brother and sister become better people, but the rules I had set in place, they guilt tripped our parents into me giving back their phones and breaking.

&amp;#x200B;

I had set rules where they only get 2hrs a day on the weekends on TVs/Phones/Gaming because they were spending 60+hrs/week gaming or watching other people gaming or stream on twitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

My thing was, I had moved back in recently because my business fell apart, went through bankruptcy, then found out my taxes are fkd where I owe 10x more than I even made, and THEN one of my closest friends screwing me over for $160k+ because he knows I cant afford a lawyer (bc of taxes situation) and then laughing about it to our mutual friends. 

I was broken. I didn't know where to go. Going to my parents was the worst thing I did. I thought my habits that were built up at the time, and the fact that even tho all this BS was happening, I was in the best mental physical and emotional state of my life (this was before friend issue). 

I didn't realize how bad things were here and I fell apart even more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent god knows how many hours trying to talk my bro and sis into seeing the consequences their choices will have, but they just did that dead eye'd knod, and went back to gaming again the next day. 

My sisters actually evolved. She straight up told me she doesn't care anymore. 

I even opened up to how I started balding because of the stress Im going through and how Im starting meds because of it. She spends like $250+/mo on shit to put in her hair, dye it or all these lotions that she doesn't even use half the time or what ever. 

I sacrificed so much and she told me she just doesn't care. 

I went through the shit she's going through and worse (my parents are a former shell of what they used to be) and I realized that her and my brother are not the type to listen. They'll learn from their own mistakes. 

It really hurts watching this because I can see its just few little tweaks we can implement that can turn everything around, but instead my parents zone out in front of the TV when ever they're ""Free"" (my mom I can't even blame her bc she does a lot of the cooking and cleaning too) and they have so many health problems because they dont even go for walks or take care of themselves at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing my parents parents, made me understand how they came to be. Then seeing my brother and sister, and me having lived on my own for a bit, made everything clear.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't seem to get through and help them. 

I cant afford to waste any more of my time on them at least not form here. I think once I move out again, become financially stable, I can get my parents a chef and a cleaning lady, and help in that manner, but I cant physically be this invested in them anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im not sure if this is the right place to post but I wanted to know how I could be less effected by the actions of my brother and sister and basically my family, so at least I can focus on fixing my own life. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

Guardian to my brother and sister since my teens. 

My brother and sister don't want to change nor care.

How do I let them go in a manner where I can at least focus on fixing my own life because its beyond a mess. 

I can help them once I fix my own life in other ways instead of being there physically, just hire a personal trainer / cook / cleaning person or stuff like that. 

They spend 60+hrs a week on gaming, my sister I think is at a point where she only sleeps during online school and games rest of the time or is on tiktok (last time I checked her screen time on her phone was 15hrs). Its like no wonder the rest of their lives are falling apart they dont do anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did it in my early 20s where I was just over it and focused on myself, I got in shape, built a business, moved out, and felt happiness for the first time ever. Now I feel guilty because I had made it and felt so happy while my family was struggling in the way they are now. 

The issue is though, they CHOOSE to suffer, they don't care or at least wont make an actual effort to change. My mom being the exception. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I distance myself a bit, at least till I can move out?"
Active-Sheepherder-5	2021-04-28 19:32:48+00:00	Son is late to everything on purpose	"I have an almost 3rd grader who is purposely late for things. It's a new phase that I think is borne from a need for control, but it's getting irritating. Especially for me because being late stresses me out. He'll be ready for school but he'll just sit there until the bell rings then leaves so he can be there late. He's doing this during school too, his teacher tells me he is purposely waiting until he's late for recess or library or whatever activity. I've asked the school to penalize him when he's late (in an age-appropriate way of course), which they didn't do before, but beyond that and conversations about being respectful of others' time I'm out of ideas here.

A bit more context: He's not depressed or avoiding activities he doesn't like, he's pretty honest about the fact that he's trying to be late but has no actual reason for why. He says he likes it. He has a lot of control over other things, like what he wears and colors he puts in his hair, etc. etc. I can't/won't react or yell or force him to get ready or do whatever because it doesn't work so I try to let him experience the consequences himself, though there really aren't any. How do you explain the importance of punctuality when there are no consequences for being late?? I've considered being purposefully late for things that are important to him so he can understand why it's inconsiderate but that petty revengeful stuff just isn't my style.

I mean, it's really not that big of a deal at this age but it's becoming a habit and not the short-lived phase I thought it would be. I'm not ""worried"" per se, more curious about how other people have handled this sort of behavior."
Moosar96	2021-04-28 19:28:10+00:00	Getting full custody of my daughter	"Hello Internet! 
I live in Tennessee. I plan on cutting ties entirely with my ex boyfriend, the father of my daughter. A LOT has gone into this decision, I’ll elaborate below and include a smaller TLDR at the bottom. I’m just really hoping that you all can give me some more advice or insight as to what I can expect or prepare for. 

My daughter is 3. Her father is not on the birth certificate (no father is listed) and we were never married. 
He is turning 31 this year, lives with his parents, and has never held a job for longer than a year. (He’s only had roughly 4 jobs, ever) he was recently fired from his job and has been consistently dishonest about his employment and ability to provide support for our daughter. He does give me $150 bi-weekly and he has her every Friday night - Sunday morning.  

We broke up January of 2020. While things have been civil for the most part, he has been consistently shady and unreliable. He will often complain of money trouble, and having a lot on his plate, to postpone child support and move visitation. 
We currently do not have any court orders (visitation, child support, parenting plan, etc) but his step mom gave him $2500 for a lawyer in February 2020 to pay for a lawyer. This lawyer said that would be the only money he would have to pay as long as everything remains uncontested. 
We were able to agree on a parenting plan but the court date to finalize has been pushed back numerous times due to covid. 

I have worked VERY hard to separate myself from my history/relationship with him in order to facilitate a healthy co-parenting relationship. 
But upon healing and growing I’ve decided that I am not comfortable with him being in her life at all. 

For anonymity, we will call my daughters father W. 

I met W when I was 13 going on 14, he was my best friends older brother. He groomed me for a year. Playing “games” and “teaching” me how I was supposed to behave for boys. I vividly remember the silent treatment that he gave me when I was to nervous to “put out” on his 21st birthday. When I eventually “gave in” things quickly fizzled and he no longer spoke to me. 

We didn’t speak for 6ish years. At a very rough point in my life he just so happened to reach out to me and we reconnected. 
At first it really appeared that maybe he had left me all those years before because of age but now that I was older everything would be okay. I moved in with him and his family and ended up pregnant within that first 6 months.

While I lived with him I learned lots of really concerning things about him. 
-he had been using a secondary app on his phone to save every snapchat that I sent to him without my knowledge. These images and conversations were stored on a flash drive, I am not the only girl on this flash drive. 
-he had a secondary Snapchat account that he would log in and out of depending on who he was talking to. 
-he had access to a “one drive” filled with NSFW images of girls from our hometown and surrounding counties, most I knew to be underage 
-he used an app called live.me, he explained to me that if you went to this account -&gt; this follower -&gt; the accounts that THEY follow are underage girls who are likely to expose themselves
-he has *undiagnosed* dissociative identity disorder. 5 additional personalities, with names and ages, boys and girls
-before he turned 18, probably during his sophomore or junior year of high school, he was accused of *something* with one of his little sisters friends. This was taken to court but the only outcome that I know for sure was that he had to attend court mandated therapy which how only completed the minimum before moving to a different county. 

I feel like some of this sounds too crazy to believe and why on earth would I stay. 
I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing by trying to help him be better, and staying with my father’s daughter. 
He regularly belittled me and had me convinced that I couldn’t make it on my own. He would use Snapchat to track my phone anytime I was a work or shop or occasionally out with friends. He would go through my phone whenever he could. 

As I mentioned above, I work very hard to separate myself from our past in efforts for our daughter. But he is consistently dishonest and sketchy. I am really concerned for her future. He truly has a history or predatory behavior and if something were to happen to her or one of her friends I don’t know what I would do. I have only ever brought this to his attention once. He threatened to fight me in court, tooth and nail, to change her last name to his when I told him no. I told him that if he wanted to turn this in to a court battle we should probably be really thorough and address the beginning of of relationship and his mental health. After 15 minutes he called me back, told me that he didn’t want to fight and asked me to promise to never tell anyone what he did. 

As I’ve started to address and heal from my trauma, I’ve started to see things in a different light. Him wanting me to make that promise solidified that he did something wrong, that I wasn’t just crazy. 

I have my own apartment now and I don’t have any assistance outside of what little he provides. It doesn’t make or break me when it comes to finances. I’ve fortunate to have a good job and have kept a good savings fund. 

I’ve talked to a paralegal and she assured me that due to the BC and never being marriage, I can pull the plug right now with zero repercussion. He will have to petition he court for parentage/legitimatization before he has any rights whatsoever, at which point he will have to go through DNA and prove fit as a parent as well. 

Going forward I will only be communicating with him via text or email so that everything said can be recorded. 

If you’ve made it this far. I appreciate your ears, or eyes, so much. I’m just really wanting advice? Peace of mind? Any warnings or insights of things I should be prepared for? To scream into the void? 

Okay I’m done now. 
Thanks all. 

TLDR: My daughters father has exhibited extremely predatory behavior, he groomed and sexually assaulted me when I was 14, he is consistently dishonest and unreliable, claims to have multiple personalities, and lives with his parents. I’ve decided to cut ties entirely to protect my daughter and her future friends. I’ve spoken with a paralegal, and will be proceeding with only text/email communication. 
Seeking any advice and insights the internet’s has to offer."

pixieEmma1989	2021-04-28 18:29:32+00:00	Very short 10 year old!	My daughter turns 10 this week and we measured her height and she's only 123cm. We have always known she was small and she always has been. (I'm only 5 foot so I assumed That she gets it from me). But people have been commenting lately about her being very small and so now I'm slightly concerned. I. Gonna talk to a health visitor about her height. She has no other health problems. Does anyone else have any similar experiences of have a very short child?

SBanks52	2021-04-28 18:28:30+00:00	How do you take 1 year old out for the day? (What about naps)?	"First time mom here and have basically been quarantined her whole life. I’m getting ready to start taking her places like to an outdoor winery/brewery for a couple hours or whatever, but what do you do about nap time? Her schedule is:

7 am wake up
8am bottle
9am breakfast
10am-12 nap
12-1 bottle and lunch 
3-4 pm nap
4- bottle
5- dinner
7- begin bedtime routine

So basically the 3-4pm nap is gonna be hard to swing. Do they usually just fall asleep in the stroller? Just let her sleep in the car on the way home after keeping her awake a little past usual nap time?

Sorry this all may sound so simple and dumb but it’s been weird basically never leaving our house with her so she’s created her own schedule she really sticks to it well."

I went to get my second COVID shot at the VA this week. The nurse was making small talk and asked what I did for a living, and what did I do in the military. I explained that I’d been an Army combat medic in Afghanistan, and that now I’m a stay at home dad. She was horrified!! Why haven’t you gone to nursing school?!? You’re wasting your life this way! Don’t you want your daughters to have a reason to be proud of you??
I politely agreed and endured the awkwardness washing over me til she was done. But now that it’s too late to tell her off: look lady. First of all, my daughters are not a waste of time. The younger is almost 2y, a developmentally critical age. The older is 10y with high functioning autism. She struggles socially and needs all the help she can get. I bust my ass from the minute I roll out of bed to the minute I crawl back in at night. Besides which, I’m rated 100% disabled with PTSD. Obviously medical settings are a huge trigger and I have no interest in fighting off panic attacks 70 hours a week the rest of my working life. I made the choice I wanted to be a professional dad and I stand by it. End rant.

zzstop123	2021-04-28 17:29:56+00:00	How do you leave a partner if you have no job or money for daycare?	"My partner and I both suffer from C-PTSD. While I've been actively working with a therapist, he started then stopped going because the co-pays were way too high (I have state insurance; he has horrible insurance through his work with insanely high deductibles and copays). 

He freaks out at me on a regular basis in front of our kids. Claiming he is my ""caretaker"", how much I've traumatized him over the years and now he's built up so much hate and resentment he can't let it go, etc. Due to chronic health problems and a baby that doesn't sleep, I find myself needing him to take over sometimes on weekends so I can sleep. It is literally a matter of life and death at times. So he'll go all in, burn himself out to a crisp and not say a word, then unleash on me every horrible thing he can possibly conjure. He throws things, kicks things, he goes full on lunatic and nothing will stop him.

Obviously this takes a toll on our kids. He's beyond stressed and overwhelmed and we have no family willing to help (even for a couple hours once in a while) and we cannot afford to pay anyone. We are forced into survival mode, just chronically in fight/flight mode 24/7.

I stay at home, in part, because anything I'd make income-wise would be close to what we'd pay a daycare, anyway. So. How tf would I be able to leave? I have no family. No money. We aren't married. How would I get a job and pay for daycare to be able to leave in the first place????"

Im_bored77	2021-04-28 17:10:02+00:00	How to deal with bad behavior from cousins influencing my toddler!?	"My child is a few months short of 2! Her cousin is 2 already. She isn’t the greatest with sharing, always wanting to withhold all toys from my daughter. When my daughter tries to play, my niece yells out “mine! Mine” her parents just stand there. My daughter repeated it and I instantly shot it down, in front of them... saying “that’s NOT a nice word. we only share. There is no mine.”
My daughter never had this word in her vocabulary. I’ve now had to stop her from saying it a few different times. Both at home and with her cousin. 
Every time we see their kid I feel like it’s a step backwards because she’s reminded of the “me, mine” mentality. 
Since I’ve scolded my own daughter before for repeating their daughter (right in front of them), i figured they’d try to encourage my niece to stop saying it too. Nope. Just let their kid sit there shouting “mine! Mine” at my daughter whenever she wants to play with her. My daughter isn’t even 2 yet and she points to her cousin and calls her mean. 
I’m seriously about to lose it on these people! Do I just start telling my niece that is NOT nice IN FRONT of her own parents!? It’s severely ticking me off that they literally don’t try to stop her bad behavior. I’m hesitant on Seeing them now, scared my daughter is going to come home with a different perspective on sharing/ fairness. Advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you so much!"
gfd54tge	2021-04-28 17:05:11+00:00	Why are toddlers / young children unkind?	"Hi, just wondering if a parent, caretaker, or teacher has any insight. I was walking by a market stall today, and I saw two children play while their mom was busy buying stuff. The older one (4M) was busy dragging a small cart away from his brother (1.5M), who was getting more and more upset and finally started to cry with anger. It was clear that the older kid didn't want the cart (it was one of those toys small toddlers use to walk), he was just slowly pushing it out of his brother's reach, all the while looking at his brother and smiling at the other child increasingly upset reaction. In the end, he deliberately wedged in a tight spot, so his brother wouldn't be able to move it, and walked away. The younger child tried and fail to get his toy and broke down completely, as the older child smiled with glee. As I said, the mom didn't see, and I'm not suggesting this is abnormal behaviour or anything. I'm just curious: is this just random pettiness, or is there some developmental reason behind this kind of stuff? Thanks!"

However, he's lately gotten into the habit of being SUPER OBNOXIOUS when he's trying to get my attention or interact. Like we'll all be sitting together on the couch and then suddenly he'll jump up and get close to my face and start singing Dance Monkey in a weird voice, or just start making weird screeching noises. I would never want him to think I'm trying to reject him as a person or that I don't like him, but he's also clearly acting strangely on purpose. He does a bit of it with his friends as well, but they all do those sorts of things.. Any advice how to shut him down nicely? So far I've just been asking him if he wants to have an actual conversation and telling him I don't like it when he does that, which makes him stop in the moment but he starts up again later. The longer it goes on the more likely that I'm going to say something mean... it also seems to be directed at me instead of my husband."
MessyConfused	2021-04-28 16:43:51+00:00	DD6 is getting bullied because she's white and I dont know what to do.	"So as the title says my Dd6 is in prep (aus) and is being bullied because shes white. 
The other kids have specifically told her this and I have heard it come from their mouths myself. Specifically; ""My mum said we cant be friends because youre white.""

Shes one of the 3 Caucasian children in her class, everyone else is a mix of other races however a lot of them are also related to each other being cousins and such. 
She tells me she gets picked on in class and during breaks so she stays inside with the teachers and goes to lunch time clubs. 
She has also told me they bully her for the food she eats, I like to think I make her lunchbox look cool and give her healthy food which also looks good and appealing for her since looks and texture are a big thing for her. But now this explains why for the past week she hasnt eaten anything from her lunchbox until she gets home. 

I dont know what to do. I was severely bullied my entire school career, i have few friends and poor social skills because of it and no matter who I told the bullying got worse because i told someone or just nothing changed and no one helped. 
Ive explained that none of this is her fault but i dont know what else to do. 
If i step in will I make this worse for her? Do we look at different schooling options?"

I'm hoping you parents can help me as a non parent! I think I had pinworms, not sure where from, but had some bad itching and irritation and finally just took the pyrantel meds. It made me feel way better and I think I saw a dead couple in my stool. So, looking for tips. I live alone but am assuming I got them from my friend's kids...

Yesterday, I took the meds and deep cleaned my place. Vaccuumed. Then wet mopped. Dusted. Cloroxed all surfaces, handles, tables, books, anything I touched. I put all my clothes in a garbage bag and washed on hot. Stripped my bed, washed it all on hot and dried hot. I even tossed my laundry hamper. I showered, but on tight spandex under pajama pants for bed. Woke up, vaccumed again, recleaned the bathroom after use, showered on hot and used soap. I wash my hands and under my nails after I use the bathroom and before I eat.

Any tips of not having them come back? Am I doing enough? Do I need to take a second dose of meds? The box says one is enough.

Do I need to wash bedding every day? I plan to just change pillowcases daily. If I'm fully dressed for bed, is there still a risk of them spreading back to me?

Also, when I shower, I literally soap up my butt and stick a soapy finger up my asshole (gross i know) and wiggle it around. will that get rid of the eggs on there? I then wash my hands with antibacterial soap and wash my labia with feminine wash.

EDIT: I also don't think I scratch over night? I wear spandex and tight pants with a waistband that I tie tight. I wrap myself up in a blanket with my arms out of it. I wash my hands after waking up and clorox anything I touched on the way."

chineequa	2021-04-28 15:46:56+00:00	I cried after a girl (9?) Looked at my son and plainly showed disgust. can I desensitise?	"My son (4) has been through a lot. He was a 28 weeker with numerous health conditions, we have also just celebrated his year cancer free. 

He may have a genetic condition but geneticists are yet to find it. As a result of his start in life he looks and sounds a bit different. I knew I would have to have thick skin from the start but I am apparently yet to develop it. 

A girl was running towards us on the school run (picking up my older son), looked at my boy and loudly said 'EW' before turning to run back to her friend, whisper in her ear and physically move friends head to look at my son.

As we came level I asked 'what did you say?' She replied 'nothing.' To which I said 'I hope it wasn't mean...' and walked on.

Does anyone have advice on how to deal with these situations? 

I've thought about introducing my son to her properly,   kill them with kindness kind of thing? Any suggestions welcome!"
Hippy_Liberal1	2021-04-28 15:35:48+00:00	Is it health to buy a my six year old daughter a vibrator? And why either way?	"Some context: I'm a divorced father with a 6 year old daughter 1/2 time. I've always tried to be open and honest with my kids, we call things by their anatomical names (penis, vulva/vagina, etc...). So my daughter was massaging herself with a massager gun and started giggling when she put it on her privates (over clothes).  I ask her to stop, she asked why and I explained that the gun was for everyone and we don't want to touch something that was on her privates.  She asks if she can have her own then.  Anyway, several more questions and now my daughter wants me to buy her a vibrator.

IDK what to do here, thoughts?"

I’m tired of my teen constantly avoiding accountability through saying “I didn’t know” or “I forgot” when they full well knew. It seems to be a disingenuous trick most teens learn because it’s one of the few things you really can’t prove otherwise. It’s beginning to irritate me because I’m seeing a lack of accepting responsibility and a lack of a good character trait that is accountability. How do I 1. Deal with this behavior. And 2.

Poctah	2021-04-28 15:33:31+00:00	What age for sleepovers?	My daughter is almost 6 and just got invited to her first sleepover. It is her best friend from her kindergarten class that invited her for her bday. I have met her mom twice at bday parties of other kids but never been to their home but it’s only a mile away from us. I plan to come inside and talk to both parents before leaving her for the night just to make sure it’s safe. She really wants to go and has begged for a sleepover for months but with covid people weren’t having them(almost all adults are fully vaccinated in my area so we are doing more now). Anyways Is this to young? Should I let her go? I know at her age I had sleepovers all the time but the early 90s were a bit different then now.

"What are others thoughts re: when it's appropriate to give a 2 year old choices, such as what to eat, what to wear, what toys to play with?

The result is that, when I tell her ""no"" (even on trivial matters), she breaks down and has a fit. Any advice is appreciated!"
nicole11930	2021-04-28 15:19:49+00:00	Road trip suggestions!	"We are going on a very long road trip this summer. First, to a small lake town for vacation, then to visit our (vaccinated) families that we haven't seen in 2 years. We have a 10 yo, 7 yo, and a baby who will have just turned one. We will also have our 2 dogs. We plan to drive 10 hours, stop for a night (a hotel with a pool to get a bit of exercise) another 10 hours, stop for a day/night at grandparents, then 10 hours to the lake. We'll be there for almost 2 weeks, them drive 10 hours to see family for another 2ish weeks, before doing the 20 hour drive home (we'll stop for a night halfway).

Obviously this is going to be a little bit painful. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips that might make it easier? We have a minivan, and the 10yo will be right next to the baby, so she can help pass her toys and everything. The two older kids are great travelers, and will have their paperwhites and nintendo switches. I'm mostly concerned about keeping a newly mobile baby still for so long. Should we try to do a lot of nighttime driving? The baby has never had any screen time, but we may end up letting her use a kindle if we get desperate enough. What would a one year old even watch/play on a tablet? Would passing her back a new toy every couple of hours help? Are there any crayons that would be safe at this age? It's been a long time since we've traveled with a baby this age! 

We aren't doing this until the end of June so I have lots of time to prepare. The goal is for the drive to be as fun as possible; we've been stuck here for over a year so we have lots of lost time to make up for. Any suggestions are much appreciated!!"

We recently moved but she still goes to her old school. Everyone’s still in the old neighborhood so I’d have to drop her off. I feel a little uneasy about it, being far away and not just a couple blocks away if something were to happen. I live in a suburb of Chicago, so not a small town, not that it makes a huge difference but definitely not a place where you know everyone and you can keep your doors unlocked. Am I being too paranoid and I should let her hang out with her friends alone?"

The most common are chocolate and strawberries. Apparently chocolate gives babies stomach ache and strawberries give rashes on the buttocks 🤷🏻‍♀️ I’ve also been told to avoid carrots, bananas, all sorts of cake, spicy food, dairy, cale, wheat and meat... (which leaves me with caviar and cucumber as my only options really).

So have any of you actually felt any difference in your babies behaviour/bowel movements when eating something specific or is it just all BS?"

Turned off the water and found that the tank of the porcelain toilet was spilt down the middle. Neither of the boys had any idea of how that happened in their sleep. They each were adamant that it must have been the other that broke the toilet.  

So, I mentioned that I could borrow a polygraph machine “from my friend in the FBI” to find out who was telling the truth.  After much discussion, we administered the test last night. It turns out that my blood pressure cuff was a pretty convincing test.  They boys were pissed when they found it was not a real polygraph.  

It was a great ruse, but these boys are tough to crack. Oh well, replacing the toilet today.  We still have no idea how it broke in the middle of the night."

He and his daughter (my god-daughter 6yo) were staying at his parents house. I immediately called to talk to him, took the day off work and brought lunch to him and his family and stayed with them for a few hours. I am a father myself and couldn't even imagine what he is going through. I knew how to support him immediately but now that it's been a day I am looking for any advice about what else I can do? I have offered to him, his parents, his brother who is back in town, that I am available to help and will always be here for them, but as many parents do I am afraid he will try to do everything himself. Has anyone who either went through something similar or supported someone who has got any advice for a friend who wants to help?"
BlackMoonLilith23	2021-04-28 13:51:07+00:00	I need feedback on yesterday’s altercation	"I told my 15 year old son that if he didn’t get on the bus &amp; go to school, I would lock him out of the house for the day.  
I said it out of anger.  
He was being defiant, he said he just didn’t want to go.  He was supposed to go back in person a week ago, and I let him stay virtual bc he was stressed that he got behind on his school work.   I contacted his teachers last week asking them to not call on him in class until he is caught up. 

I would never lock my kids out of the house.  I have found making threats in the past to get him to go to school.   So I tried it again.  
Then  I told him he could work in the garage office for the day on his chromebook, but not stay in his bedroom and do school on his gaming computer. 

He refused to go out to the garage office so I said I’d call the police to get him out.  Again, It was a threat, and I realize I shouldn’t have done it.    I dialed but hung up as soon as he said we was going out. 

He called his dad crying saying I locked him out.  I never locked the doors.  And I made him coffee and a bagel and went out to the driveway to soften my tone and try to reason with him. 

I know my approach was wrong.  It’s “worked” in the past, but at what expense?  
He said I was scaring him.  
Now my soon to be ex husband has written a letter from his attorney to mine saying he’s concerned for the children.   I have a good relationship with all 3 of them.  Once in a blue moon when I see blatantly disrespectful behavior, I become a “yeller”. Angry.   I guess there is a trigger point in there that needs healed."
imgrowing1027	2021-04-28 13:43:47+00:00	Son's mom is encouraging poor nutrition.	" 

My son is a bit of a picky eater. He does eat some veggies and he likes most fruit. But he also likes a lot of high carb foods. I'm having an issue with his diet at his moms. She feeds him a lot of high sugar foods. yesterday he told me his mom puts sugar on his celery! This makes it even harder to feed him healthy food when I have him. 

I'm afraid if I push too hard, he will just stop eating at my house and wait until he is at his moms. He is 6 and he's a big kid. Structurally big, although I feel he is also overweight. 

Have any you had to deal with this? What can I do?"
nataliajossu	2021-04-28 13:26:13+00:00	Signs of ADHD?	"My daughter likes my good friend’s family. They have twin boys, only 6 months younger than my daughter (she’s 3 this July). However, I find them a bit troublesome as they tend to hit each other, and my child ends up being hit too sometimes if we the adults don’t prevent it in time. We have to be cautious and be prepared to stop a violent act when someone looks like they’re about to attack. Sometimes the boys will grab her cheeks quite violently, hit her with some toys, and also pull her hair and she’s cried because of it. Some days they’re more calm &amp; that makes my child happier to play with them. At some point she didn’t wanna see them for a while but now that they played again recently I still notice that they still like to hurt others (the boys also tend to do this on each other). My child doesn’t hit back. She’s often just stunned. Their parents feel bad about it. They’re very active boys, they like to get on the dining table so quick &amp; jump on it. They’re still on sippy cups (a phase my child skipped) and if they see a cup with water in it they flip it. Sometimes they flip their plates full of food too. The parents don’t seem mad and just clean it up. That’s something my child wouldn’t do on purpose, and even if she spills something she likes to clean it before I even notice. I feel like the twins can’t contain their excitement and they lash it out with violence. Or is it because they’re boys &amp; there’s two of them? I just notice a lot of behaviors that my child, nor my nieces have done (I helped raise them since babies). I know that kids are different but I’m worried it’s signs of ADHD but I don’t wanna hurt my friend’s feelings by asking her to get the boys examined."

Deafisnotdumb	2021-04-28 12:51:50+00:00	Son stresses himself over grades/sports and I don't know how to help him.	"My youngest is in 10th grade and is 15. He is a good kid but stresses himself out so much about school and sports. He is determined to graduate valedictorian so any little slip up is crushing to him. He is taking AP and honors courses and works himself so hard. His school has switched between virtual, hybrid, and in person and right now they are in person. His stress levels are higher now than they were when he was virtual. He waa freaking out last night because he has a test today and the material they learned on Monday is going to be on the test when he originally thought it wasn't going to be. 

It also happens in sports. He plays hockey in the winter and his coach once said that he isn't the best on the team but no one outworks my son. Now it is tennis season and this is a sport my son excels at. His coach believes he has a chance to play Division 1 in college. The amount of effort he puts in to perfecting his game worries me. 

He is a great kid but so stressed out. I am afraid of him burning out. My oldest was a great student but made time for herself and enjoyed high school. My middle could stand to put in a little more effort himself but he does well and doesn't stress grades. My husband and I are not focused on grades and never have been. We are not pushy crazy parents. I don't know what I can do to help him."
page456	2021-04-28 12:51:00+00:00	What to say to kids about toxic people you cut off?	"Figured I’d try a shorter question. My husband and I aren’t in contact with my mom or his aunt as they’ve been pretty cruel to me in the past and this repeat behavior comes with no warrant, no explanation and zero acknowledgment of their “mistakes” or an apology or attempt to do better.

I believe they’re both semi evil and sick women but that’s a story for another day. 

With help from our marriage counselor we’ve set up boundaries and since these women don’t care to say sorry or improve, we are basically NC.. turns out passive aggressive and narcissist people will actually NC themselves practically when you stand your ground and they refuse to acknowledge how crappy they’ve been. Seems they rather die than say sorry or just be nice.

My husband is mad because I’ve been put in awkward situations where my 5 and 7 year old (mostly 7 year old) have not understood a situation or what’s going on and I basically had to tell my oldest (about each toxic person)” So and so isn’t nice to mommy. They don’t want to talk about it or say sorry so we are on a timeout/break now.” 

To me this is a child friendly way of telling them. In a few more years I’m going to be a lot more Frank. My husband says he doesn’t like children thinking they’re entitled to adult issues or that they think they can put adults on timeouts and got mad and said “How about I tell them the same about your mom that you did with my aunt?” I said “I’ve already told them. I don’t sweep things under the rug..” and quite frankly it upsets me that I’m the one mistreated and yet expected to continue to protect the reputation of two nasty women who have brought a ton of grief to my life. I spent a lifetime doing that and everyone thought I was crazy (because I was losing my kind being treated poorly and covering up because “we don’t tell others family business” and “blood is forever”) and how I’m done.

I want my kids to enjoy their childhoods but I absolutely plan on telling them everything about my dysfunctional parents and why they aren’t in contact along with other relatives. I’ve had enough of people treating me poorly and then covering up for them.

Am I wrong? My husband doesn’t know what he’d say when I ask what we say then.. his reply is he doesn’t know or to not say anything and keep the kids out of this. 

Any suggestions or stories of your own? Feedback?"

I have four kids, all teens now. I had my first child when I was almost 37 and my fourth at 43. I’m 56 now and still have a 13 year old in middle school. Many of my peers are grandparents several times over already and I’m still fighting with lazy, fresh teens to get out of bed and get to school. They think of me as a doddering old fool. In fact, my 13 year old has a friend the same age whose mother is only 31.

Spoiledwife77	2021-04-28 12:33:41+00:00	My son got some life lessons yesterday	"So my son graduated from HS last year amid all the covid crap. He didn’t take drivers Ed in school because we couldn’t afford it so he used some of the money he got from graduation to pay for his online driving course. He got a job pretty soon after and between me and my mom we have been getting back and forth to work. Now I worried that he would struggle with work since he has squirrel syndrome aka adhd . He has never been officially diagnosed but I have friends that say he has several symptoms. 

Let me tell you that boy exceeded all our expectations! He is a damn good worker and even impressed his boss to the point they gave him a 2$ raise after 6 months. Got another 1$ for getting forklift certified. He used his first tax return and some of his stimulus and we helped him buy a car. I have been letting him drive to work (I’m with him) to get him some driving experience. After a long ass time the dmv was finally taking appointments for the driving portion of the test.

We set up an appointment for last Tuesday. We get there and they ask if he watched this particular video , he says no cause we didn’t know anything about it. So they get him all registered and he pre-pays and he schedules another appointment for yesterday. We are on our way there, we get half way there and the car dies at an intersection. So I have him go to the passenger side and push while I steer and push from the drivers side. A nice man helped us push the car off the road. 

We then proceeded to try and figure out what happened. I know a little about cars so I’m looking and I can see right away that there is something sprayed all over the engine. I thought was oil but didn’t smell like oil and didn’t smell like coolant either. So we then decided how we are going to get the car and us home. We have roadside assistance that covers the tow and my mom came and picked us up. I felt so bad cause he couldn’t take his driving test and his car was now broken. 

Now for the silver lining to the story. At least 6 people stopped and asked if we needed help! Once we got the car home and my husband had a look at it we found out that is not going to be an expensive fix. The car blew a heater hose. And for some reason the battery crapped out, possibly cause of the alternator. 
All in all a somewhat cheap fix. Once we get that done we can yet again schedule another appointment for the driving test."
LovesAGoodNap	2021-04-28 11:13:57+00:00	4yo tries to hide it/ downplay it when he hurts himself	"My son has developed this weird habit in the past few months where he will try and hide it/downplay it when he hurts himself. 

Eg in the playground a while ago he knelt on a twig that pierced his jeans and cause his knee to bleed. I heard him say ‘ow’ but didn’t realise he was bleeding for about 5 minutes because he was very deliberately trying to hide it from me. 

Then this weekend I was playing with my 18mo daughter on the swings while he went off on his own, and a few minutes later he reappeared with tears on his cheeks limping a little. When I rushed over to him he just shouted ‘it’s all better’ and held out his arm to stop me getting too close. 

Basically if we’re doing something fun, and the injury isn’t severe enough to make him properly cry he’ll try and hide it. 

Now I understand that he doesn’t want to stop playing, but I need him to come to me if he hurts himself. Ive never been precious with him, if he’s ok to keep playing after I check him that’s cool, I’ll let him do that, but he’s acting like I’m going to put him in a glass box whenever he scrapes his knee. Maybe that’s what they do in his creche. 

My wife would be a bit more precious with him than me, but she doesn’t really bring him to the playground. He’s also fine showing injuries at home (when his sister bashes him which she often does) and if his sister hurts herself or is upset he’ll leave the playground to take her home without (much) objection. 

Any advice on getting him to chill?"

1) it’s the same people over and over again that are asking (mainly hubby’s side of the family, particularly his aunt and cousin, whom has like 5 kids herself) 
2) it sounds like they’re referring to an animal when they say “getting fixed”

I try to think of things to do for her that are fun and her go to answer is no, then she realizes what I said and sometimes says yes. Due to her being at home and me having to take care of her sister while also studying for college I let her watch about 2 hours of TV in the morning and in the evening. In between her friend comes over and they play together or I take them on small outings (going for ice cream for example) or I sometimes do scavenger hunts for them. It depends how the night went and how cranky the little one is.

I am not perfect, I am annoyed a lot because I feel so under appreciated by her and of course her little sister is quite demanding and my husband is a teacher and has to be at school - no more distance teaching.

I feel like I am constantly angry at my four year old and it drives us apart, because she wants to be with her dad. Granted, due to her sister, I can’t bring her to bed and actively playing with her gets harder each month as her little sister gets more and more mischievous.

There’s little time to spend alone with her because we have a lot going on and her sister is very attached to me.

Is this normal? Her complaint? Her always not liking the suggestions I made? 

Today a close friend invited her to an outing in the woods with a trained professional to discover nature and I was so excited to tell her. She simply said no, I don’t want to. No reason why, just no. She knows the friend, she will even go with her best friend, it’s something new to do and also the friend and her best friend are our upstairs neighbors so we spend a lot of time together and she knows them so it’s not like she doesn’t want to go because of them. She just doesn’t want to and I don’t get it. It’s everything she loves, biking and nature.

I am getting so tired trying to think of things for her. I feel like I am raising a spoiled little brat.

Please don’t judge me. I’ve also been doing the Corona thing for a year. I was heavily pregnant when it started, had a traumatic birth with a c-section and a recovery and trying to navigate everything while never catching a break. I am exhausted and so sad that I think I have lost the connection I had with my older daughter.

What can I do? Am I alone here?"

My 6 year old is quite overweight. It is affecting her because she can’t run like her friends, she can’t climb like them. She gets out of breath easily and then things are not fun. She’s left out and she feels like something is not right with her. 

We have followed the cookie cutter pediatric weight loss diet. But it deprives her. She will sneak out behind my back to get a hold of junk food it I do that. Or keep eating something she likes till her stomach hurts. She also looks forward to the eating part of the day more than anything. 

In my understanding, kids that age usually stop eating once they’re full. Am I right? 

Now, I’m overweight myself but I do model healthy behavior. I cook everyday. We mostly eat at home. My husband/her dad is a runner and very fit. 

We have an HMO insurance and the primary care physician needs to put in a referral if we have to see an endocrinologist for her. Looking at me, the pcp probably believes that I’ve given her access to calorie dense food. We’re never taken seriously. 

My question is, a kid who eats healthy for most part and is active during the day is putting on weight. Shouldn’t this be further investigated? 

I don’t discuss this in front of her BTW. I just always have nutritious food around (my husband keeps me accountable honestly). We walk a lot as a family (she doesn’t enjoy of course) or bike ride. 

Has anyone actually got their little kid to lose weight? 
Again, we have high blood pressure and metabolic disorders in the family and I don’t want her to suffer from weight related issues. She’s very beautiful and it’s not about how she looks."
MomsGotCrap	2021-04-28 06:29:53+00:00	"Partying and parenting, where do you draw the line?"	"Just wanted to see if I can ask some more experienced parents to weigh in here, I have been seeing this trend on Instagram reels. These little videos are like tik toks, everyone is doing them you know whatever I'm not judging cause I'm watching them on instagram lol. Anyway, one video keeps getting my attention; it's mom's playfully dancing while pretending to be picking up their future teenagers from at party at 1AM or something. I am currently a mom(27) of a 20 month old lol, so really this isn't like a personal question, just more of some insight of what it is really like to have a teenager who might party? Or, ask to go to a party, do you parents let them? If so, how is it? If not, why not? And when will you let them go party? Now I was not really able to go to parties, I had to lie to my parents (mom+husband), they didn't give me permission to go to parties until I graduated high school. But when I did go to parties by telling them I was sleeping at a friend's house, we would go party and go back to her house to sleep, so I wasn't lying (but I lied when they asked, what we did with our night). Basically what I'm saying is parties and the things we did we're pretty crazy when I was in high school, and I just can't imagine how I'll ever allow my daughter to go with permission, but also don't want her to sneak around and lie like I did. Again this is just a random thought, lol just looking for some input on how y'all deal.."
BrightGarden9	2021-04-28 06:21:21+00:00	Annoying Neighbor Kids	"I have a kindergartener and a 3 year old. We just moved to this neighborhood and we met a group of 3 siblings across the  street and they hit it off with my kids immediately and wanted to play all the time. They came over a couple times a week for a while and then it got to be too much and they would make my 5 year old cry and just be rude and obnoxious and say things like our house is dirty and that I look pregnant when I'm not even pregnant. They would go into our food and start eating all the snacks out of the cabinet. So I started avoiding them because they seemed to be always outside waiting for us to get home. I started telling them no they can't come over. Their dad even told me to tell them not to come over if the time isn't right. So I started creating boundaries and telling them no.   


Then I let the girl come over last week after them not playing for like a couple months and her and my daughter played for a while and it was fine. But she came over the next day and I told her that we were about to eat dinner and she just stands at the door asking when she can come over or if she can come tomorrow and its so annoying because she doesn't take no for an answer. 

Then today she came over again right at 5:00 when we are both getting off work. I was actually still working because I work from home so I was not answering the door, but my husband walked in behind her I guess and she started asking him if she could come inside. I told him to tell her no and he did but she kept saying that I said she could come over and he got frustrated and walked off and told me to deal with her and left the door cracked and then our dog ran out into the street. 

At this point I am so mad because I've been working all day and the last thing I want to do is deal with this kid and chase my dog down the street. And I walked up to the door and yelled at my husband that ""he let the fucking dog out"" infront of the kid and I told her ""no its not a good time"" like really angrily. My husband is pissed and yelling too because he just got off work and doesn't want to chase the dog either. So I feel kind of bad for yelling in front of her...I know you shouldn't yell around kids but these kids are driving us both crazy and we are just like over-stressed from working all day and dealing with all this crap.   


Is it ok that I just don't want other people's kids at my house all the time? I remember when I was a kid I would ride my bike to my friends houses but I don't think it was every day. Between working and taking kids to school and everything else I have to do I barely get a chance to relax and I don't want some other kid bothering me because my own kids are enough work as it is. I know my daughter wants a little play friend, but during the week I'm like so stressed out from all the crap I have to do that I just don't want the responsibility of watching another kid.   


TLDR: Neighbor kids are annoying and don't take no for an answer, but my kids like them. I don't want them at my house all the time. They were cute at first but started being rude and annoying."
GuildensternsDilemma	2021-04-28 06:16:41+00:00	I’m afraid to tell me dad I love him	"Because I’ve never done it before, like many others my parents split up. It was pretty recent and it wasn’t on good terms, to sum it up my family has been riding the waves of guilt, fear, disappointment, and downright bottom of the barrel emotion that I don’t have a name for but the loving soul within me screams when I turn to confront this feeling. I’m not sure where it started or why it started but my mother heartbreakingly gave up on my father, while also giving up on love, and at least partially herself. Writing this now I realize that the bottom barrel feeling might be guilt, the reason my mom left, or at least the final straw, was a message I sent her out of anger and resentment for all of the anger and resentment she had for my father. But of course I don’t know the full story, apparently my father had been forceful with their intimate relationship and even physically threatening. None of which I wanted to know but all of which brings me pain and I swear I can feel the tear in my heart as I talk about it. I’m sitting in my basement room, 3 days before I move out because I can’t withstand the pain this house brings me, because everyone left, and I’m all alone. But my dad is still here it’s his birthday, but every time I think about the love I have for him there’s an evil tainted scar on top of it, put there by my mother, and so I don’t know if I fully love her either, simply because it wouldn’t be fair to my father. It wasn’t anyone’s fault in particular, my mother had an issue with my father, but my father was too intimidating for her to talk to him about it, which I can’t help but see as her being too afraid to stand up to him which means a happy life for our family was not enough for her to throw away fear. But I sit here now in the same position, doing the exact same thing, leaving my father, essentially giving up, because I just can’t seem to face him with vulnerability. It’s like I’m afraid he’ll reach into my stomach and crush the only love I have left for him. And that’s not what I want because I know he’s doing it because he’s afraid, afraid we’ll leave him so he just decides fuck it I’ll push them away myself, one last act of power, even if it sacrifices love. So now I’m left with all of these facts and ALL of the facts point toward the oh so common answer “you need to cut toxic people out of your life, even if it’s a close family member or friend, trust me it gets better” but that’s not the answer I want, love is all powerful in this reality, it can conquer all by surrendering as a stepping stool. But I think love is like a trap, it elevates its opposition so high that it can see everything, a hateful idea raised high enough will look around at the view and see nothing but love, therefore becoming it itself. But maybe I’m naive, or rather, maybe you think I am, I know I am not. But I ask for your advice anyway, and more than anything I could really use a hug, and a little bit of support. Thank you for reading &lt;3 it means everything to me"

Seeing who can get who in trouble first. I put together a “clip chart” where if my kid makes a bad choice I clip them down and if they get to red then they lose _______ for a week. My fiancé (their dad) was laughing that I break lots of the rules I have for them and I was being a hypocrite. I always say I want to “teach my kids now”, because my mom acted as my maid and I never had to lift a finger or do anything I didn’t want to and now, as an adult, I am having to teach myself how to function. 

So, I made a “clip chart” for my kids to clip me down for every rule I break, if I get to red they choose my punishment. This may have been a bad plan, but I am curious about how it will go."
kitterific	2021-04-28 05:03:39+00:00	Pre Partum Depression?	"Is that a thing?

I don’t know if what I feel is depression or something else. Apathy? Reluctance? Exhaustion? I just know that I am not as excited through this pregnancy as I was for my first. Even though it was 100% wanted and planned. I am 24 weeks pregnant.

It is hard for me (30F) to describe how I feel to my husband (34M) and our toddler (2.4M) is obviously oblivious. There is a lot of background and I can expand if necessary, but I’ll try to keep it short.

My husband is the breadwinner of the household. That wasn’t always the case, so I’m left feeling a little.. useless, though I know it isn’t the truth. He has a lot on his plate, especially now. My husband works 50-60 hours/week and is pursing school for two separate masters degrees. He has very little time for much else besides work and studies. He recently quit his job to work from home and makes a good deal more than he did at an office (which wasn’t much). Though, we are getting by financially, money is still a little tight and somewhat uncertain. 

I used to be the main provider until I got pregnant the first time with our son. Shortly before I gave birth, my husband acquired a new job (the one he just recently left) and, after he proved himself there, I was offered a position with my husband’s company. Now, the pay at this company has never been great. Together, we both made minimum wage. I was able to work from home as a personal assistant for $250/week. Yikes. Barely worth it, but it helps me feel somewhat useful while being able to care for our son full-time from home. It pays for a few essential bills. I still work in this position, but am seeking something better. The work has always been demanding and I put in 30-40 hours of active work per week. I am expected to be available at a moment’s notice from 8:00am-8:00pm 7 days/week and assist 3 agents at a realty company. There have been times where I have had to ignore my son to meet their demands. Now that I have my own license, I am looking to move on. Not working isn’t an option because our financial situation is rather unstable at the moment and my husband needs me to contribute so he can focus more time on school for our future benefit.

Sorry, this is getting longer than I expected..

My son is very attached. We all have a great relationship with each other and he has really blossomed SO MUCH with my husband at home. Though, as I mentioned, my husband is his own level of busy and can’t do much of the care. That has always been our arrangement. I am more than happy to take care of the household and caregiver duties to ensure my husband can provide us with a better future. He scoops the cat litter and does the odd task that I ask and I do the rest. I handle the diaper changes, the put-downs for naps and bedtime, meal prep/groceries, play time/stimulation , the wiping of surfaces 5x per day (toddlers are sticky), the vacuuming (so much vacuuming...), dishes, laundry, general cleaning, etc. 

My husband is great about supporting me when I ask, and I try not to ask because his work and studies are both SO demanding. But it’s taking a toll. I’m just feeling burnt out. I don’t know how I can handle a second child. 

Our toddler is a good kid, but he is in the “terrible twos” and we are feeling it through his tantrums. His speech is delayed, so communication is tough. He is making great progress with his speech therapist, but it is still difficult most times. He is the world’s worst sleeper. It was not until he was 19 months old that he slept for longer than 5 hours at a time. I went over 1.5 years on a very broken up 2-3 hours per night (30 minutes here, an hour there) and it was torture. I now average 4-6 hours per night and he tends to only wake 1-2 times. Such a blessing. We send him to daycare for 3 hours/day, 4 days/week. The break is enough to allow me to focus and catch up on my job. He naps about 1-2 hours in the afternoon, lately, which has been great for a bit of a break and getting more work/chores done. It is difficult because he still nurses to sleep, purely out of comfort, so my husband can’t put him down. However, he is starting to wean himself slowly. Very slowly. 

To make things even better, we have no family close by to help. My mom passed away 3 weeks before my son was born and my dad lives across the country, a 22 hour drive away. My husband’s parents are just 2.5 hours away, but not close enough to help, and are preparing to move to Europe. Daycare is limited and based on the school schedule, so we will have to go without care during the summer or pay 4x as much for a different facility. We have no friends or support in the area and don’t even know where to find a babysitter. We are alone.

So, I guess onto the issue... I’m not excited about this upcoming baby. I very much wanted a second child when our boy was younger and sorta talked my husband into how great it would be. Now that I am 24 weeks pregnant, I have yet to feel excited. I feel regret. We have not been as involved in this one because how little we have been able to focus on anything besides work. We have only discussed names on 3 separate occasions and only for a short discussion. He is not allowed to the doctor appointments due to COVID, so his involvement has been severely limited, except for one ultrasound. I have virtually no pregnancy symptoms (not complaining!!) besides getting “fatter” and feeling the baby move. So I am less focused on the physical changes. It’s like.. just not on the radar for us. I know my hormones are acting up, because I don’t usually feel so overwhelmed, tired, and constantly sad or on the verge of giving up. I just feel alone and helpless. But is it just being overworked and neglected in a sense? Am I being too dramatic? Can I properly care for my son AND a newborn? My husband will have an insane work/school schedule for a few years until things stabilize and I’ll be left filling the void. It seems like too much. Once I leave my current occupation, it will be so much easier, but much more uncertain. Can I begin a new career as an independent contract worker and find leads/close sales on my own with a demanding toddler and a newborn? Our little family is so close and happy, how will our boy handle a new addition? We have tried explaining it to him, but it’s all just a woosh. And he is so attached, there are going to be major jealousy issues. I’m just not ready. We haven’t even prepared for the new baby in the least bit. It’s so much. I have so little energy.



Sorry this got so long. Typing it all out has been therapeutic, even if nothing else comes of it.

TLDR: Overworked, tired Mama with an overworked, tired husband and a very attached toddler that already has communication troubles and is bound to have jealousy issues. We have no support network and are alone. Please send help."

KingdomOfDirt	2021-04-28 04:44:45+00:00	Living with In-Law who doesn't have boundaries!	"I like/love my MIL but she doesn't have boundaries and my husband doesn't either. She's extremely pushy/nosy to the point whereas my husband says it's better to just cave and let her do what she wants because she is so relentless it's uncomfortable. I'm a person that's incredibly private and quiet and because she is the way she is and I am the way I am... I have found myself under extreme mental stress. 

My biggest example today is that I was trying to parent my children. I like to do natural consequences and just let the kids learn on their own. Tonight one kid wanted to try and switch bedtime outfits and wanted me to find the specific outfit and dress them. The kid is perfectly capable of getting dressed and finding their own clothes at the point. I said sure to have at it but the lights are turning off in five minutes and I've already gotten you ready for bed so if you haven't figured out the outfit by them you are out of luck. Obviously, the kid didn't like that and spent time doing obvious things to try and lure me into a drama of finding their outfit and re-dressing them. The problem is the whole time MIL kept jumping into the conversation and messing up the flow. Talking over me until I was literally yelling. Jumping up and rushing around to try and find the special clothing the kid wanted. Trying to get the kid out of her shoes (that's my kid's other ploy to try and prolong bedtime. They can take shoes off now but try and make you do it and make it a drama when you won't so they can stay awake longer) I want them to learn the lights are going off in five. I did my job and cared for them... if they choose to undo it that's on them. It sucks to sleep in shoes, it sucks to wear the heavy hot nightgown they wanted... it sucks to try and have to do that in the dark without the normal tuck-in-routine and so forth. This method of teaching has worked amazingly for my kids in the past... IF I can ever employ it! 

Not only that but I feel like MIL robs me of nice mothering moments as well. Like today the kids were painting butterflies and asking about what color the butterflies can be. They asked ME directly but I had to rush to get my words out before MIL cut me off and started yammering on into a science lesson and leaving me in the dust. 

The house is small and paper-thin walls. I can't fart three rooms over without her hearing it and zooming out of her room to interfere with everything. 

I've set boundaries before but the other family and she included always act like I've done something really horrible to her. My husband is slowly starting to break out of his routines but it's not fast or good enough. For example.... kid has a bathroom issue the other day and we had company over. Husband took on the issue and kept kid fix everything in private so they weren't embarrassed but as soon as he and they came out of their bedroom MIL in front of everybody loudly asked what was going on???? Husband snapped back none of your damn business because he just got to deal with a very emotionally embarrassed child that didn't want everyone to know anything about what happened. Everyone (but me) GASPED and I just laughed which got more GASPS from the family. and he immediately apologized 
 to her. 

Anyway, you guys are more than welcome to jump in with thoughts, advice, or criticism if you want. I'm mostly just venting. I know what I need to do... make boundaries and enforce them but that's hard when your hip deep in emotions and family."

"Considering Montessori for my wilful, stubborn, spirited, delightful, hilarious and moody child when he turns 3. I have visions of the transition period being chaotic as he gets used to new expectations. I love what Montessori can offer in terms of confidence, courtesy and responsibility (which are things that I really want to instil but I’m not sure I’m doing a great job of it at home based on current results! ). Also we are behind in potty training since birth of second child = regression. So….maybe in my heart of hearts I’m concerned that it won’t be the best fit for my son. Don’t want to squash my square peg of child into a round hole and set him up for failure. On the flip side, I’m hoping that Montessori could help him with preparation for school (he’ll be attending regular school). The Montessori school is accredited and highly regarded so I’ve no concerns that they are “Montessori” in name only.  
 
I don’t want to move my son from a play based school if it sounds like he won’t thrive in Montessori (I have horrible thoughts that he will be reprimanded all day long) ."

I've always worked a 9am to 5pm schedule but lately I've been thinking of switching to 3rd shift for a couple of reasons. I've had sleep issues my whole life and am more of a night owl. I also am getting so tired of working a 9 to 5, I just crave a different routine where I'm available to be with my daughter and take her to appointments when needed.

I've  recently come across a specific job that would be from 8:00pm to 4:30am that I feel would be near perfect hours. I can get home, cook breakfast for my daughter, and sleep in until my daughter is done with school. My daughter is still schooling online from about 8am to 3pm so I'll be asleep but she can wake me up at anytime if she needs anything. She tends to be pretty independent with school. Then I'd have free time with her until about 7pm when I would leave for work.

This schedule seems great to me but I've always heard how hard night shifts can be so I'm a bit worried that I may be overlooking a certain obstacle. I also have seen many people posting about how they have less time with their children when working nights,  but I feel like I'd be having more time with her, if not the same amount.

I should also mention when I'm away at work I plan to have her sleep over with a family member and I'd pick her up on my way back home. So childcare would be covered.

Just wondering if how you all managed a 3rd shift job and any pros/cons that I may not be thinking of."

She’s clingy and wouldn’t go to her room unless we convince her and one of us goes with her. As of lately she’s been co-sleeping most days. Should I stop her? What are the cons of co-sleeping?
rorymiloever	2021-04-28 03:21:34+00:00	Idk what to do of my partner who I'm with literally 24:7..	"It's a long story but we have two kids a two year old and five month old. I'm tired. 

We live at my moms and it's. A pretty bad situation like we can't use the house and her husband is just I could go on forever but it's not reasonable to live her tho we have for a year now.. me for two years him the last year .. 
he has not saved any money besides his tax return to move out.. 
he plays online poker snd is here 24:7. I'm tired of being around him!! I can't escape him in my moms house we are in the same room nonstop. He doesn't help enough with the kids and I get like an hour every other day of alone time. I'm so tired and my personal space is so exploited. 

I have a splinter stuck in my foot for about a month and can't get to a dr or anything bc not able to leave my kids I've had to cancel dr appts, I have so much stufff I need to Go out and do but can't bc of being with my kids 24/7 and yes I grocery shop and do all that with them but some things I can't do (not allowed to bring them to dr with me bc covid) and honestly it is exhausting to even do stuff out with a 5 month old and 2 year old a double stroller doesn't fit in my car, so I put my infant in a stroller and carry around my 30 lb toddler while I try to grocery shop etc and ITS HARD 

I'm so tired. I'm having a breakdown today bc my foot hurts from the splinter.. my back just started hurting.. and I see myself being completely neglected and idk what to do anymore"
TankedInATutu	2021-04-28 02:59:44+00:00	But Do They Really Though?	"Apologies in advance for any weird grammar or formatting, it's late and I can't chill out enough to sleep. I had an exhausting conversation with my mom earlier that I can't shake off. Lots of parenting related topics and philosophies were brought up with me (after acknowledging that none of it was immediately relevant to me because I only have a toddler) landing in the camp of ""when reasonable give kids of all ages grace and space to be as ridiculous/emotional as they feel compelled in a safe space and also their boundaries deserve respect just like any adults"" and her falling more in with a ""kids need to know that the world won't cater to their wants and needs"". 

There are definitely things that my parents could have done differently, but they were objectively good parents. The missteps were minor in retrospect and came from good intentions. But I can't wrap my around my mom's stance. Yeah, the world doesn't care about your feelings but that doesn't mean no one cares about your feelings. And why does a kid need to learn that lesson, but the adults don't (the inciting example was grandma wants a hug, but jr. doesn't like peoole touching him)? What's wrong with making sure kids know that it's okay to ask that people respect your preferences? Obviously there's a lot of gray area because too far one way is full of entitlement and the other way is laying the foundation for an adult who doesn't know how to respectfully and confidently advocate for themselves. 

It's silly, but this is swirling around my brain and stopping me from sleeping. I recognize the merit in teaching kids that they can't always get their way, but I don't feel like I benefited from that attitude. At least not the way my parents went about it. But I also haven't been at this parenting thing very long. I'm tired and have entirely too much work to do tomorrow to still be awake."
Mysterious_Ebb5229	2021-04-28 02:54:36+00:00	How do you get your toddlers to sleep through the night???	My 21 month-old will not sleep through the night. She'll go to bed at around 9 then wake up in the middle of the night around 2 or 3 am and then be up until the next day. She takes only one nap a day and be up by 3pm and still wake up in the middle of night. Even if she's tuckered out from the park she'll still wake up. I'm trying to get a good schedule going for everyone but it's really hard when she wakes in the middle of the night and won't go back to sleep. It throws her entire schedule off.

i_do_not_know101	2021-04-28 01:31:37+00:00	My 17mo boy can’t eat anything but this one barley based baby cereal	"Idk what else to feed him, whatever else I give him, he either chokes on it or has some sort of delayed allergic/ symptomatic reaction. 

The only thing I feed him is breast milk and Heinz barley baby cereal. 

I tried feeding him smashed bananas, boiled sweet potatoes, peas, carrots, potatoes, and boiled egg. My husband gives him those squeezable fruits bag things every once in a while and he can’t even handle those things. He starts having reactions like jerking awake in his sleep while crying loudly (which doesn’t happen if I follow my breast milk and barley cereal routine), his nose and area around his mouth turns reddish, he rubs his nose and eyes a lot as they turn red, and overall becomes more whiny and just sticks to me while being in a bad mood the whole time (he usually runs and plays around and is in a good mood with the regular diet routine ). Either that, or he cannot get it down his throat cuz he can’t chew properly and starts chocking violently, even if it’s a very soft, small piece of food.  

I’m worried he isnt getting all the nutrition he needs to be getting to grow up strong and healthy. His teethes came is about a mouth ago and he started walking about 5 months ago, I don’t want anything else to be delayed. I also don’t want to feed him the same barley cereal 4-5 times a day, but rather give him a variety of new flavours to try out. 

I don’t know what to do, I want him to have variety and be healthy."
undulatus9	2021-04-28 01:31:25+00:00	"Noticing insecurity about looks in 6-year-old step daughter, unsure of what to do"	"So I am a step mother to a 6-year-old girl. I have known her for about a year and we have bonded very well. Recently she has started to open up to me every once in a while about her disappointment with her looks- lamenting about how she has brown hair and wishing she had blonde hair like her favorite cartoon characters or random children at the grocery store. She also has told me that she dislikes being pale and wishes she could have tan skin. She also is constantly talking about the eventual children my husband and I will have, and is obsessed with the possibility that it will come out with blonde hair and blue eyes. When she looks in the mirror sometimes she gets sad and her mood is a bit sour for a while. I asked my husband about this and he said that he's never heard her say anything like that, so I'm not sure if this is a new development from something at school or if I'm the only person she's opened up to (I'm the first female figure she's ever had in her life besides her grandmother). She has even started to criticize aspects of my appearance, like my curly hair, and tries to ""straighten"" it with a hair brush. I've talked to her about keeping comments to herself regarding others' looks but I have a feeling that it might just be her imposing the standards she's learned from somewhere. 

 These comments are very disconcerting to me, mostly because at 6 she should not be concerned about her appearance, at all, but also because I was exactly the same way as a child. I had a dismissive and emotionally abusive mother that criticized my looks and had always wanted tan skin and blonde hair growing up. I'm sort of at a loss here because I can't talk to her like I would a peer, and I'm worried that maybe there's something going on at school, at grandma's (grandma and grandpa are her babysitters when we are at work) or if she's just watching too much media. How can I make her feel better? Is this something that would warrant therapy? Or is my questionable childhood just causing me to overreact?"
constellationally	2021-04-28 01:25:05+00:00	My husband is upset I painted our son’s nails	"My son’s (6) favorite color is light blue. Three nights ago, he offhandedly told me, “Too bad color nails are for girls.” 
I took a brief moment to think and then told him, “Colored nails are for anyone who wants them.”
He excitedly told me he wants light blue nails, so I got light blue nail polish with the groceries yesterday, and tonight, we painted them together.
We were sitting there in the bathroom together while they dried, him watching something on Netflix and I was reading a book, just keeping him company.
My husband was walking by, said hello, and then stopped in his tracks and said, angrily, “What did you do?”
Son was oblivious, engrossed in his show.
“We painted his nails light blue, his favorite color!” I replied, keeping a smile. 
He mouthed, “What the fuck?” at me (the “fuck” was audible) and walked away.

To be fair, he didn’t know we were going to do this; he works long hour weekends (Saturday-Monday) and wasn’t around for the conversation. I didn’t really anticipate it being a point of contention.
I don’t think I’m being unreasonable in painting my son’s nails at his request, and I’d really just like some advice about how to navigate this impending conversation with my husband (sure to happen after the kiddos go to bed) while he is engaging in.... toxic masculinity? Am I overreacting in assuming this is toxic masculinity?


tl;dr Painted son’s nails, husband upset about it, need advice on how to approach conversation about it"

He loves spaghetti but will take what little bit of ground beef that is in his bowl and literally throw it on the ground (naturally we are trying to stop this, but it's a work in progress). He likes chicken nuggets too and will eat oven-baked ones, but we've tried giving him shredded chicken covered in a sauce that he's eaten before and liked. That too ended up on the ground. My MIL has tried endlessly to give him beans (both whole and refried) and those are also a 'no'. We are at a loss, he's not malnourished or underweight and he gets enough fruits and veggies amongst other foods, but we'd really like him to get more protein in his diet.

any tips for getting him to eat his meats?"

Both older kids are wanting extra cash and have a TON of free time.  I have also been ill recently.  Each morning recently they ask how I’m feeling.  If things are rough, they offer to watch the younger kids.  

I am effusively appreciative and give them as much cash as I can- to the point that we have about the same amount in our account as each of our kids do, lol.  

Occasionally they act resentful of the setup.  I ask them not to offer if it’s not something they want to help me with.  But they keep offering for two reasons- to help me through this tough time and also to earn cash.  

Any thoughts as to how we can clean this whole process up?  I’m filled with guilt, they’re resentful, and yet in ways this setup works for all of us."
veronicab27	2021-04-28 00:28:43+00:00	2 year old throwing tantrums and harming himself	"Hi everyone! This is a long one and kind of rambling, sorry! I have an almost two year old son (21 months to be exact) that within the past few months has started throwing what I would call extreme? temper tantrums. He was the easiest baby, and up until now has been the most easy going, sweetest toddler. Some are so bad he almost makes himself sick, will bite his hand so hard it leaves marks, or will hit himself in the head or face. He usually will throw a tantrum when I tell him no or won’t allow him to do something he has set out to do. For example, todays tantrum was because I told him he couldn’t swim in the duck pond at the park lol. I tried holding his hand and redirecting him, he threw himself down on the ground, snatched his hand away and started walking back towards the pond. This lasted well over five minutes. It got to the point I decided to leave the park because I could just not calm him down or redirect him. I was so embarrassed. I’m just not used to him behaving this way. At home he’s a relatively laid back, easy going toddler (every once in awhile he’ll hit himself if he’s told no) He also pretty much has free reign of his space at home. Meaning he has toys he can play with, books to look at and a big couch to cozy up on. Same with our backyard at home. It’s fenced in and he has many activities that he can hop around to. Very rarely is a temper tantrum thrown at home. I should also mention him and I are home the majority of the week. One day a week he spends the day with his grandma and cousin aged 2 1/2 while I work and one day we usually go shopping or out to eat with his grandpa. I’m wondering if these tantrums and the hitting are partly due to him not receiving a lot of time with other children or in a more structured setting? My husband thinks it’s his age and he’s too young to go to daycare/preschool. I’m sure I’ll get over my embarrassment of the tantrums but I’m also really concerned about him harming himself. Any insight or advice would be so appreciated."

Should I be cooling the food significantly before putting it into the Tupperware to prevent any sort of melting/warping/weirdness with the plastic lunch Tupperware?  All my Tupperware says it’s microwave safe , so in theory I should be able to just toss the hot food in and put it in the fridge/ lunch box  until morning. 

Also, should this be on another subreddit? Like a Tupperware subreddit? Or is this a parenting issue? I was not sure, but I figured I would ask here since parents pack lunches pretty frequently.

Two days in I get a text saying she never really liked the school and she was doing just fine remote and she should just stay remote and start fresh in September, which is true. She's always gotten straight A's during this time. However, I feel like she needs to learn a lesson that we can't always get what we want and she needs to owe me back something for all she has done.

annacondah	2021-04-28 00:05:50+00:00	My 8-year-old is a VERY picky eater &amp; tries to puke up new foods. Advice? (Possible TL;DR)	"Good evening, everyone! Just joined the group and have a huge predicament on my hands. I'm doing the best to my ability with this so any advice is greatly appreciated. Apologies for weird formatting as I'm mobile. 



My child is eight &amp; the only grandchild on both sides of the family. I've been working since she was an infant, so I do admit my absence &amp; the grands' prominent presence in place share blame with her being an incredibly picky eater. If it isn't chicken, potatoes, toast, yogurt, or any basic fruit (generally speaking), it's a no. When I try to introduce new foods, it's drama: eating all but the offending food, arguing, and tears mainly. Now I don't stray too far with new foods, so it's been mainly carrots, corn, and spinach (Spinach is cool with her). I'm also not lpud or aggressive about it. To be honest, even one bite is a victory some nights. This particular night, however, was ROUGH. 

A couple nights ago, I made a simple dinner of grilled chicken, roasted potatoes &amp; **zucchini**. A pretty harmless addition, right? NOPE. After 20 minutes of the usual trying to get out of it, she tried a bite with some chicken resulting in dry-heaving &amp; near-hyperventilating for 5 minutes until regurgitating the forkful onto the plate. Not what food she had eaten , but this one bite. I got her calmed down, cleaned up, and dinner was over. 



I'm really at a loss over this &amp; don't know the next step to take aside from trying again in a week or so. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
page456	2021-04-28 00:01:20+00:00	How to tell child you cut off toxic family ?	"Without getting into too much, I have a covert narcissist mother and my husbands aunt is passive aggressive and a nasty person as well. These women likely both have their own issues as they can’t seem to explain why they are bad to me but I finally had enough of forgiving and forgetting and mentioned them to our marriage counselor through various sessions.

She agreed with me.. these women are toxic and if someone cannot be loving and kind to our entire family then they don’t get access to our kids or continue to get to engage with me and make me miserable. 

Aunt in law was given a chance to talk and ignored all emails and letters (she got them as we attached tracking) and narc mom Will boundary stomp and do something literally 8 times in a row you’ve asked them not to.. she won’t say sorry so we are not in contact either.

I’m mid 30s but finally now learning to stay more composed and hold my ground and expect an apology and changed behavior to move forward and neither of these women like that or will do it.

My kids are 2, 5 and 7 and the older two (mainly the oldest) press and ask where they are or why we can’t go visit etc. My oldest really wears me out.. 

My in laws invited crappy aunt over knowing I was coming with my kids and I said nope not going in.. won’t be having dinner.. this lady is nasty and I was ticked my in laws failed to tell me
She was there knowing the issues at hand.

My son nonstop bugged me about why he couldn’t go inside abuelitos house and presses nonstop..

Instead of telling my kids Their grandma is psycho &amp; tried telling their dad their mom needs to be on heavy psych meds (yes she is sick) or that their aunt purposely won’t write my name on anything, hands out gifts in front of me making sure I see she got me nothing, said I “still look pregnant”.. and all the other nasty details.. I finally just said “So and so is not nice to mommy so we aren’t hanging out now. They have to think about it and we have to talk one day maybe but right now we are on a break ok?” And I stress to my kids that everyone has to treat all members of our family kindly.

My husband got uptight about this despite him knowing an agreeing his aunt is awful to me.. bc I’m “involving kids.. “ when I was pretty mad my in laws (his parents) put me in the awkward and crap situation to have to explain to my son.. 

I feel like I gave an age appropriate explanation and I’m irked my husband has the audacity to act like we have to keep protecting crappy people and their crap behavior 

Did this my entire life for my narc mom while she backstabbed me and made me look crazy but I was raised under that whole idea we don’t talk about family and blood is blood.. and I always covered up awful shit she did but finally got sick of it the last few years seeing she wasn’t a person making mistakes but a real toxic person 

My husband quipped “ok well how about I tell them about your mom then?” And I said “I already did! Told them we are on a break from grandma too bc she’s not being nice to mommy..”

I’m sick of hiding the shit others do and have debated telling my kids the entire truth as older teens.. I’m tired of looking like the bad guy personally and dealing with two covert narcissists is really hard.. they are very conniving and the type who will absolutely plant poison in your kids head ever so subtly to set you up as the bad guy so for me it’s
Important for me to be honest and open with my kids and I felt that was about right for their age.

My husband doesn’t agree and it truly angers me. Am
I wrong? He said I’m getting kids involved in adult matters and I don’t agree.. what should I do or say?"

I got the stuff together and told her to wait one minute while I got the last things we needed.

When I returned 30 seconds later, my 5 y/o was gone and the shattered blender was all over the floor.

I went and found my daughter in her bedroom under the covers thinking I would be mad at her. I wasn’t. I first asked her if she was OK and then asked her what happened. She said: “I didn’t know it was made out of glass.”

It made perfect sense. The blender doesn’t really look like glass to a 5 y/o. She didn’t mean to break anything. It was an honest mistake. She had been really looking forward to making this smoothie.

I never got upset. I realized it wasn’t the right thing to do. It accomplishes nothing in the end. Trying to be a better person than I was yesterday."

Lemonintolemonade	2021-04-27 23:12:03+00:00	Advice - daughter never shows affection	"Daughter is 8yo, has always been very moody. She’s hard to please - never satisfied. She’s also very sensitive, and keeps a lot to herself. 

I encourage her to talk, say what’s on her mind, and express her emotions. She says it’s hard and she would rather not. 

I used to question myself and think the way she is was my fault. My 2yo daughter is the complete oppositive (extra affectionate, expresses gratitude daily, etc.), so I now think it’s part of who she is, and not a consequence of my parenting. 

I try to use positive parenting as much as I can, I have read all of Janet Lansbury’s books and really think I’m providing her a safe and loving environment.

I would like to teach her the importance of treating people who loves her with attention and consideration. For example; when I drop her off to school, I go for a hug and say « I love you », and I’m lucky if I get a « bye mom » back. Same thing at night, when I tell her I love her before she goes to bed, she stands awkwardly and only replies « goodnight mom ». I would like for her to express her feelings but it seems so hard for her to do. 

Am I crazy for pushing her to think about how to treat the ones who love and care about her? Should I just accept her the way she is and keep on doing my thing even though I basically never get a reaction from showing my love and affection?"

Have a baby, lose the weight, get back to work. 

If you’re lucky to have a support system, or extended family to help with your children,  I am envious. 

Today was like any other day trying to get childcare for my youngest of 3 children. I received an excellent job opportunity at a school, but my child is too young to attend. Every nursery school is full, she’s on half a dozen waiting lists. 

I called one woman and she said she charges $18 per hour, and I was told I would only be making $15 per hour.. I forgot to mention that I will also be responsible for my other child’s tuition. 

Basically I will be earning nothing except validation from society that I am actively working. Also the biggest factor is I just want to do what’s best for my children, and give them all opportunities to socialize and thrive; even if I don’t earn a dollar. But how can I afford to pay more than I even earn?

My middle child was just diagnosed with T1D, 4 months ago. So when I got this offer at this school, I was happy that they had a preschool program for my child to attend. I felt safer knowing that even though I wouldn’t be in the same room I was just upstairs. 

I graduated in 2020, with 3 kids under age 5, in a pandemic; with multiple honors. I have worked hard and I push myself to keep trying but it just feels like it doesn’t matter. 

I have no support, and my husband is never home because he is financially providing for our family. Currently I am working in food service on nights and weekends when he is able to be with our children. I am not too proud to stay at a job that puts food on the table, even though my education makes me “over qualified”. I am just grateful to be employed and have any opportunity to help provide for my family. 

What kind of American Dream is this? One where my husband and I are like two passing ships and we never see each other? A life where I get asked about my marital status and children in job interviews? A life where I feel like I’m not good enough? Consistently putting my own needs last and feeling like an empty shell... 

Well I declined the job offer, it’s done; and so is my faith in the American Dream. It is more like an American nightmare that I wish I could wake up from. I want to live somewhere that society places a higher value on family and not corporations. I want to live somewhere where employers ask me about my skills and not my personal life and children."
Nixiiebaby	2021-04-27 22:59:30+00:00	"What would you do.... Kiddo, 14M Doesn't want to live with Dad...."	"This might get long.. and if it does, I'll add a TL;DR.

\*deep sigh\*

My kiddo, 14M, does NOT want to live with his dad. 

\- We have week on week off custody, with both of us being his (M) legal guardians.   
\- I (N) have remarried (A), dad (J) has a live in girlfriend (S).   
\- I live closer to his school (private school) than his dad now does, but only by maybe 10 minutes.  
\- I have three other kids, two older (by marriage) and one younger (with current partner). His dad has two 'step' children, one older and one younger.  
\- I am one of those froofy peaceful parents that doesn't parent from a place of anger. I don't spank and my punishments are usually losing privileges. His dad will take zero advice from me and is 100% anti-ex wife. (We've been divorced the better part of a decade, at least. I lost count because YAY I'M NOT MARRIED TO HIM ANYMORE!!)

The last several months have been building up to a much bigger explosion than any of us were anticipating. The usual ""I want to live with my mom, I like her house better."" Fine. There's no reason you can't go to your dads.. there's nothing wrong with his house. Anxiety spikes for M, he starts falling behind in school more and more, escalating to missing school entirely because, according to J, he (M) wasn't ready on time and he (J) had to work (from home.) Unexcused absences are Zeros and bring down his grade. At my house, M is the priority and even if he is late to school, he gets there. (He's usually never more than 15 minutes late and first period is home room, so it doesn't count against him.)

Anyway! Almost a month ago, M was making noise about not wanting to go back to his dads house - per usual. He hates the transition. I suggested maybe we try Sunday exchanges, because he often complained of having to take his backpack full of laptop and meds to school on Monday for transitions.. and this way would reduce the amount of stuff he had to take on Monday. His dad agreed. Sunday came, and nope don't wanna go. I text his dad and say ""hey, Team M needs to have a meeting and talk about what is going on. When can you come over?"" He says ""Sorry can't, but you're welcome to come here."" We took him at his word and packed kiddo up in the car and headed over. J seemed taken aback that we took him up on the offer but invited us in, regardless. Apparently, he forgot to tell S that we were coming over and coming in.. she was not happy. M couldn't put his thoughts into words, but kept shaking and crying and begging me to take him back home with me. I put on my brave face and told him he'd be fine. After we left, M overheard his dad and S talking about ""the audacity"" I had walking into HER house and overstepping my boundaries and how NOT OKAY it was. I legit just said ""Hey, your dad loves you. You'll be fine. Talk to your dad about how you feel, work through it if you can."" and when M asked me to voice his main complaint, I was like ""you sure, dude?"" and he was like ""YES. Please. I can't"" and when I did, S was very annoyed, so I imagine her comments about my audacity were bringing up the fact M doesn't like hearing her scream at her oldest kid. I diffused and played it down that it's just louder because the kitchen is next to his bedroom - and maybe they could soundproof that wall to help deaden the sound since he can be sensitive to loud noises. No response from J on that one, but whatever - his house, his problem. That entire week I got texts from M begging me to let him come back. I kept explaining as much as I'd love to, legally I cannot.

Fast forward to last week, it's time to go back to dad.. dad texts and says he's on the way to pick M up and have him ready to go. M nopes out again, I invite J into the house and say ""you might want to talk to him."" And left the room. M tells him all his reasons for not wanting to go back, etc. J got passive aggressive and started saying things like ""If you don't come back with me, I'll sell all your stuff and convert your room."" and ""Fine, you don't have a room at my house anymore"". When M begged him not to sell his stuff, and was crying saying ""I love you but I can't live with you right now, please don't sell my stuff."" J told him he was being irrational and crazy and finally got annoyed and just left, announcing to me he was calling his dr to change his meds because ""He's manic, or something. I can't make sense of it."" I didn't hear all of the convo, and M didn't share with. me more than what I've shared above.  (Yes, he has a therapist who he JUST started seeing and is getting to help unpack a LOT of baggage so quick into her time with him.)

All week, J texts M asking him to call, saying he misses him, etc. M ignores them and asks me what to do. I tell him.... ""Talk to your dad"". I give him advice on how to talk to him, as I've known his dad more than half my life at this point. I tell him to make lists and keep a journal. Write things down, email them to yourself if you need to. Text yourself, whatever works. We make lists together. He plans out his ""perfect world"". (basically, living with me full time and seeing his dad on weekends and some holidays) then he plans out his almost perfect world. He asks his dad to pick him up from school Tuesday and dad is like YEAH! but then several hours later, he sends a text to his dad saying, no nevermind, don't. I can't do it. J texts me to intervene. A and I intervene as much as we can and get him to agree to go to his dads house for the week. (I grilled him to make sure there is no immediate harm, house is clean, no one hits him or touches him inappropriately, etc) By his last class of the day, he starts noping out of everything again, but eventually resigned to letting J pick him up. I got texts from him about half an hour after dismissal begging me to come get him... then 20 minutes later saying nevermind, he'll be okay for the week. At this point, his teachers are emailing and asking if things are okay because for two weeks he was doing great and suddenly he's having a really hard time.. and when I explain he went back to his dad today they are like ""Oh.""

M has been telling me random tidbits here and there about how when he asked his dad about why he spent more time with him than me in the early days of our divorce - dad says ""because your mom didn't want you."" Which is absolutely untrue - he prevented me from seeing him, kept telling his lawyer i was a drug addict, or a shoplifter, unstable, etc. Countless home studies, and drug tests, and evaluations later I proved those were all false. Our divorce was bitter and brutal. J and S talk crap about me where M can hear it and then act like he's making it up.. ""He's crazy"", ""He misheard"", ""You're twisting my words"" or my favorite ""It was just a joke.""

I want to consult a lawyer to see what my options even are, but my husband isn't ready to go full blast just yet. In our perfect world, my kid is happy and healthy and spends equal time between his dads house and mine.... but I am also willing to go full mama bear.   


So, what would you do?  


TL;DR My 14yo kid doesn't want to live with his dad because his dad is being emotionally abusive. He's falling behind in school because of the anxiety and depression from having to spend time at his dads house and wants to live with me full time. Ex and his partner aren't taking it seriously and acting like I'm just trying to use our son against them."
plukhkuk	2021-04-27 22:24:36+00:00	Separation Anxiety made worse by the pandemic?	"So my baby just turned 8 months a few days ago and for about a week has been showing all the signs of separation anxiety. She would even cry if I go to the kitchen or the bathroom even if her dad stays with her. It's quite terrible to be honest. Today I took some me time so I could nap/relax and just stayed in the bedroom with snacks and tea for over 3 hours. She cried so hard! It was tough but I seriously needed a break.

So I know that having baby interact and leaving her with other people - family and family friends helps with the separation anxiety but due to lockdowns my baby only ever spent time with me and her dad. I started going out more with the baby but I feel that we lost so many opportunities for my baby to get used being around other people.

This is especially worrying for me because in about 2-3 months I'm planning to go back to work and put her in day care... it just seems it will be very hard for her and me..."
SNewton97	2021-04-27 22:22:46+00:00	How to handle a complaining child.	"So my SD is 8 years old and this has been an issue for little over a 2 years now and only seems to be getting worse. My SD is a major complainer. It's gotten to the point where I don't want to take her places or do things with her because I know she will always find things to complain about. 


For example(and just because I want to rant about it), we took a family trip to the zoo not long ago. On the drive to the zoo, she complained about the time of the drive and how bored she was(even though she has an iPad with games and books). Once we got to the zoo ticket booth she complained about the how loud the people were and how hot it was(it was 75°f and a lovely spring day). We then got in and started walking, after just 30 minutes we got complaints about how her feet hurt, she is too hot and sweaty, we are going to fast, but when we slow down we are going too slow. She even started complaining about how her shirt was too tight, even though it is new and fits her well. We tell her we will break fo lunch at the midway point, soon we get complaints about how she is just starving and can't wait untill 12, how we didn't bring the snacks she wanted, her water is too warm, she wants to sit over at x spot and not where we sat down. Once her father and I had enough of it(after the millionth comment of how miserably hot it is) we tell her we are leaving. Now we get to listen to complaints about how she didn't get to see her favorite animal, how long of a walk it is back to the front, how her water is still too warm and now her shoes are now uncomfortable. 

I try to acknowledge her complaints but not feed into them. I don't jump to fix every problem and we have explained to her how the constant complaining makes everyone unhappy. Sometimes I feel like she just complains so she can hear the sound of her own voice because most of the time the complaints are ridiculous. Like her complaining about her shoes being uncomfortable, the shoes in question are new running Nikes that fit her very well and she said previously are very comfortable. 

I have gotten to the point where I don't like taking her places with me because I know she will find something that makes her unhappy. I recently left her behind when I went fishing with my dad. She was upset about not going, but I knew she would only want to be there for 30 minutes, and my father and I would get to listen about how hot it was, how its too muddy, how bored she is, there is too many bugs ect. 

I want to do things with her, but she just makes me want to pull my hair out. The complaining gives me anxiety and I know it makes everyone around us either upset or annoyed. I also don't want her to always be looking for the negative and being the person that's excluded from fun things because of it. 

So my question is how do I get her to stop with the constant complaints? What can I and her father do to help curb this behavior? 

Also, there is nothing wrong with her like sensory issues or health problems. She is a very normal, healthy girl."
awilliams123	2021-04-27 22:15:17+00:00	I hate the food fights	"My kid ruins every meal. Doesn’t matter what it is, could be taco night, could be chicken nuggets, could be turkey dinner, she literally sucks the joy
out of every meal by complaining and fidgeting, and making a gigantic mess of her plate, getting up every 2 minutes to ‘pee’ or ‘oh look a squirrel!’
I am sick to death of it. She hates every food and is usually still sat at the table in front of her food long after everyone else has had enough of her shit and long gone, and then I am stuck trying to negotiate the rest of her meal down her face.
I can’t make a simple enough meal for her. I want to just exclude her from mealtime, because it’s just too agonizing. She is 5, and I realize she is still so very young, but these days everything is 3x as hard as it was before this covid shit and I’m out of gas.
I just needed to rant after making a fabulous meal for the family and being left with nothing but rage because of her. She is lovely all other times. I just don’t want to fucking feed her anymore.

End of rant. This felt good."
bluelinebrotha	2021-04-27 22:08:38+00:00	"Issues with shyness, wetting pants and the bed"	"My son, who is 6, is a very, very quiet kid in public. He's very shy and won't usually engage with people at all.

&amp;#x200B;

He is by all accounts, a ""mama's boy"" and must at all times be physically attached to his mother. Either by hugging, hanging off her leg, or in the same general vicinity unless he's playing with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

At school he will pee himself because he's too afraid to ask his teacher to go to the bathroom. He will also hold in his poop and have accidents during sleep. He's afraid to make friends and often tells me he sits alone at recess and ""doesn't have any friends""

&amp;#x200B;

At night, it has been a nightmare. He goes down fine but every night he either pees or poops in his bed. There is nothing we can do stop this other than putting a pull-up on him. The room smells awful as you can imagine and it's very hard to keep clean.

&amp;#x200B;

The other problem we have is that he is emotional and cries about...everything. A paper cut, you'd assume was the surgical removal of his finger or a broken bone. If he doesn't get his way, total meltdown. If we want to go somewhere, total meltdown. If he is in a meltdown or you ask him about school, the meltdown continues and he gets angry and cries more that you asked him.

&amp;#x200B;

As a father I know I could be more available in his life. I work long hours and my wife usually takes care of them more than I do. I worry that his behavior now is solidified into his personality, and his immaturity will never improve. I've read countless stories about bed wetting, peaceful parenting, and kids being attached and afraid that they will lose their parents. None of the advice has worked and his behavior and meltdowns are getting so bad we are considering taking him to the doctors to see if they can refer us to a mental specialist. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are at wits end. My son is incredible SMART and in touch with the world. He is not autistic or special in any way, but he has some demons that he needs worked out. I don't want him to stay back a year and we may do tutoring to help him with reading and math this summer."

My little brother stares at lights and the sun sometimes. Like he will glance right at the sun over and over again. He likes to stare at the light bulb light. I don't know if this is part of his ADHD. Anyone else has this problem with their kids/siblings? 

When he does stares at bright light bulbs or glances at the sun, I tell him to don't do that because it will damage his eyes. He does it anyway.

bumbaclotbae	2021-04-27 21:10:02+00:00	Can babies vomit on command?	"To me this sounds pretty ridiculous but my wife is trying to convince me that our 10-month old can vomit on command. Today he started coughing like he is choking and then started vomiting in the middle of his feed. She was feeding him solids - chicken and mashed potatoes. She claimed that's what he does when he doesn't like the food because he simply can't communicate that he doesn't like the food to her. I didn't question any further because these kind of discussions can quickly lead to heated arguments.  


 I get worried because I notice that she sometime feeds him, what to me, looks like large portions for the baby. I mean at the end of the day I know she knows what's best for our child because she handles everything and spends the majority of her time with him. She's done a fantastic job and I know there is no way I could compare as a parent but every time I question anything to do with the baby or the way she feeds him - the situation gets real sensitive and she gets super defensive and angry. Anyways I feel like the whole ""baby vomits when he doesn't like the food"" was just something she made up in order to hide the fact that maybe she's in the wrong on this one..."

I've bought new shirts several times but they all get stretched out the same in a one second act. How can I get my toddler to stop doing this? I've wasted so much time and money on new shirts that all get destroyed so quickly, so easily. My toddler hangs off my shirt the same way she hangs off my hair. It doesn't matter if my hair is tied back or not, she'll grab on and use my shirt or my hair to stand up, crawl on to me, crawl over me, or just because she can. There's been way too many times where she just leaps onto me and hangs onto my hair or shirt. There's no way to avoid this, I've never taught her it was okay. I've always said no and showed her where my hand is or my shoulder, and to do this instead. But ""no"" has always meant ""yes, do that quicker with more effort"". I am so uncomfortable in my own clothes, it's driving me insane. My toddler is 16 months, she's been doing this to me since she was 3 months. Help me, I just want to be comfortable 😭"

Ducklanding20	2021-04-27 20:28:29+00:00	My son has been acting odd at my parents house	"My son (1 year) and I had to move in with my father and his gf. My son has been around them countless times before for sleepovers and such and they are great with him (I think) and he’s usually always so excited to see them. Since we’ve moved though my son will not leave my side. He screams if I leave a room, just doesn’t want to be without me. Which I just assumed was a new phase that coincidentally happened at the same time as our move. But the second I dropped him off at me ex’s house he was fine and had no tears for missing mom. So I’m thinking okay, he must just miss his home and is adjusting to my parents. 

Today we went to visit my grandmother, and I had warned her beforehand not to take it personally if he acts standoffish/just wants mom. Well, the second we show up he’s all smiles, wants to cuddle her and play. He had never been to her house before either and all he wanted to do was explore, didn’t matter if I was present or not. 

Now growing up, my dad was always the good parent. He was very loving, not strict, has continued to be a great influence as my siblings and I have become adults, and was a complete 180 from my mom so I even have something to compare it to. So I cannot wrap my brain around this sudden reaction from my son. 

My initial mom instincts kick in and my brain goes to something must have happened that has caused my child some sort of trauma with them but the last time he was alone with them he seemed perfectly fine and normal when I picked him up and, honestly, that would mean I don’t know my parents. They’re the most loving and supportive people I know, example being that they’ve allowed my son and I to move in rent free until I get on my feet. 

So I’m just at a loss right now on what’s going on. He’s perfectly fine in any other house that we are in, I’m almost leaning towards my parents house being haunted. Like I can’t even go pee without him clinging to my leg which is so out of character. What can I do to make him more comfortable in our new temporary home?"

I’m wanting to try for another baby. But regarding my age and the fact I’m still in university has garnered comments along the lines of ‘throwing my ambition and goals away to child rear, while only having 2 years of study to go.’

Why do some people (mostly non parents) assume you can’t complete goals during pregnancy/ life with young kids. Since having my baby I’ve managed do full time uni, with no help other than husband and daycare, and also gain a part time job.

I guess I'm just worried he won't be the same easygoing, loving kid he has always been since he was born. I'm worried he will change suddenly and drastically, and im worried I won't know what to do, being so used to how easygoing he has always been. 

It's worth mentioning he's also special needs and maturity wise he is closer to a 7yr old. He's a sweet child and he really doesn't have any behavioral issues. I'm just worried puberty will be like a behavioral light switch for him and if so I'm worried I won't know what to do or how best to handle it. 

I guess I'm just curious about anyone else's experiences. If other parents here had kids that were easygoing from the start only to become nightmares upon hitting puberty and how they managed that. Or if it didn't seem to change their easygoing demeanor."

She used to let both me and her dad put her to bed on alternating nights with no issues but recently, as in the last four months or so, only will let me put her to bed. 

She sleeps in her bed all night and is potty trained but won’t let anyone else put her to bed but me. She spends one night each week with her paternal grandparents and sleeps with her grandmother, since they don’t have a separate area for her to sleep there. 

I’m a stay at home mom and she spends most of her time with me. Dad works long hours five days a week and has the weekends off. We’ve just barely gotten her used to me leaving alone on the weekend so she can spend time with dad but bedtime is still difficult.

* Able to adjust remaining time by increments of 5 minutes or less.
* Able to disable the iPad when time runs out.

Peyroniselegantcurve	2021-04-27 18:36:53+00:00	HELP!! I don't know what to do	"I have an 8yo daughter with some issues. Today we got a call from the school principal saying that ""Tia"" was on the playground during recess swinging on the swing set. There was a girl swinging next to her, same grade different class. The girl was telling Tia how her dog had died last night. My kind, sensitive and filled with empathy daughter says to the mourning little girl, ""why don't you get a gun and kill yourself.""

WTF? Seriously. I don't know where this comes from, (well I possibly do, probably the internet?) but her mother and I NEVER speak like that.  And she LOVES animals (no she's not abusing them) which makes it all the stranger. 

This is pretty out there and extreme but, my question is: Tia has two rats that she truly loves. In order to teach her some empathy, I was thinking about either telling her in the car on the way home from school that her rats had died. Or just not saying anything at all on the way home, put the rats up at a friends house, and either telling her they died or not really saying anything at all just telling her they're gone and that's it. Or legitimately giving her pets away as punishment.

I don't like the idea of lying to her, we try to stress the importance of being truthful. Would the shock hurt her more than it would help her,""

I am much more into the organizational side of things, keeping track of routine, taking him to the playground or biking to the park, eating healthy, listening to music and have reading time etc...we spend a lot of time together, and laugh and enjoy ourselves as well.

But with daddy it is just sooo much more fun.

I am more than happy that my child enjoys time with daddy but also wonder if I should make an effort to be more  outgoing. However it doesn't really come naturally to me and I also can't help to make sure that things work as they should (hygiene, meals, bed time etc...).

Is it ok to just be myself, or should I make an effort to be more relaxed and funny overall?

We have been racing toward a deadline for the past week and will continue to do so till the end of the week. We'd been looking forward to a much needed weekend. 

She lives 400 miles away so we don't see each other regularly but speak on the phone frequently. She and her longtime BF are having relationship issues. I try to be there for her whenever she reaches out to me. I would really love to be there for her now in person but I am exhausted. This is not the first time she has asked to come last minute. I should add that she somehow manages to bring up my mother and other family members who are happy to host her on short notice so this of course presses my buttons triggering a deep seated sense of inadequacy (yes I've had years of therapy). I should add that she is fully vaccinated but my husband is awaiting his second and I am scheduled for my first. She knows we dont spend extended time indoors with anyone outside our pod. We do not have a spare room so when she visited in the past we gave her our master bedroom and we sleep on the floor in the living room. 

Should I just let her come or would I be an a-hole if I tell her we can talk on the phone and could see her in person with more planning? I struggle with boundaries."

My partner typically likes to not call out when kids lie, but it just messes something in me, especially because there's 0 need to lie. But I also think it's my issue, because the lies are most of the times not about important stuff.

How/where do you draw the line? Do you let your kids get away with more innocent lies?"

We need  something in our backyard to make it so the kids have something to do in the backyard.  We don't have a heck of a lot of things for them to do outside.  We'd like them to spend more time out there playing.  We were thinking a swing set.  Being 8 and 5, I don't know how long they would use it for.  I was thinking pool, but the 5 year old isn't a swimmer yet, and our backyard would need a lot of grading to make that happen.  Also in Ohio that makes it a 3-4 month a year thing."

1) Getting old sucks.

So I was putting groceries away and lost my balance — a tuna can fell off the shelf and hit his under eye area. The injury looks like a little cut, but no bruise. Daycare asked my husband about it twice today! Do they really think I’m abusing him? If they bring it up again what should I do? I want to get angry at them — they know our family and my son, how dare they insinuate I would hurt him? But then I worry that being defensive won’t help. What should I do. I don’t even raise my voice to my son... that someone actually thinks I would physically harm him makes me so sick to my stomach. My son is my life. I love him! I am in my third trimester and a bit clumsy these days, but it was an accident... sigh... I feel bad. Should I send them a preemptive email right now explaining the situation?"

Kgrawlings	2021-04-27 16:05:39+00:00	2yo has meltdowns on what we call “solo” bedtime nights.	"My son will be two next month, and most nights I am the only parent home to do the bedtime routine and get him to sleep (my husband donates plasma after work twice a week for extra money, and at least one day a week goes out to get footage for his YouTube channel after work). It has been like this for en entire year, and my son hasn’t showed any sign of it being something he has a problem with until a week or two ago. On nights when my husband is home to do our big family hug (that’s essentially the only difference between solo nights and joint nights) and kiss him goodnight, he gets into bed without argument and smiles at us and calmly watches us leave the room and goes to sleep. Lately, on “solo” nights, I will hug and kiss him and put him in bed, and he immediately chases me to the door when i try to leave the room. I generally go back into the room and read him a book if he’s too upset, or sometimes take him to my bed to watch an episode of his favorite show and then put him back in bed, but after about 20 minutes of humoring him, I just have to put him in bed and leave the room. He will stand right inside of the door and scream at the top of his lungs, sometimes for 15 seconds and then go back to bed and go right to sleep, sometimes longer. I don’t understand the change in behavior, bedtime used to go very smoothly whether his dad was home or not. Nothing about our routine has changed. I’m at a loss."

Right now my in-laws help and he will be going to daycare soon, but I am wondering if anyone was willing to share their schedules with younger kids?

When do you and them wake up? When is breakfast? When are your drop-off and pick-up times from childcare? When is dinnertime? What do you do between dinner and bedtime? When is bedtime for them and you? Do you offer a bedtime snack? What chores do you do at night or in the morning to be ready for the day?

Thanks so much!"

me and my fiancé are totally okay if she works for now while I stay at home with my son. 
he clings on to me then anybody (for now!) he wants me before wanting anybody else. it’s been like that since he was 6 months or so. he just loves his dad and just has a preference. 
i get the idea that when I tell someone I’m a stay at home dad I’m “lazy” or “don’t want to work” but no that’s not the case. I love working, I love the outside world lol. we just want our son to be home with one of his parents for now. 

i can now take him out for walks, go to the park, fun outside activities as it gets warm ( I live In Wisconsin) 
I just enjoy interacting with him and being in his presence.

Our daughters nursery asked what they want us to focus on in the coming months.

I suggested we put ‘Building a sense of pride and eagerness when learning. And to be rewarded for her individual thoughts and ideas’. But my wife thinks they do that anyway and they should be focusing on potty training.

I was wondering what other peoples opinions were on whether she has a point?"

I don’t have any kids yet but my spouse and I are starting to more seriously consider conceiving.  My spouse has depression and panic disorder.  I’m nervous about how having a child could impact their mental health, and I am scared to tell them that because it feels cruel.  I’m also nervous about how it will impact my own mental health, and everything I’ve been reading is just saying “the well parent just picks up the slack”.  Is it so selfish of me to be scared of that?  I obviously want to support my spouse, and I want them to experience being a parent, and of course I would be there to do my fair share of things.... but I’m still really anxious about what that will look like.  Any advice is welcome.  Thanks.  And if there’s a better place to post this, just let me know."

I've noticed it get smaller, but now it's gotten to a point where it's hardened and won't shrink anymore. I got a referral to a neurologist and after a CT scan he's recommended surgery stating that bone has hardened over the bump (essentially the lump over his skull has now been covered by more bone). The doctor is saying w/o surgery the lump will never go away.. hesitantly, I've scheduled surgery...

I don't want him growing up with a sizeable lump on his head, but with surgery there will be a permanent scar across his head. All of this is very frustrating for me because this is my first and only child and I'm trying to make the best decision for him. Has anyone heard of any outcomes/solutions outside of surgery?

Tyler_origami94	2021-04-27 14:11:23+00:00	Advice on changing co-parenting schedules?	So I got my son into preschool at one of the schools I work for. That requires me to take him to school since I work in a different county than his mom's other child goes to school in.  His mom and I are not together but we co-parent really well. Currently I have him every Thursday after work to Sunday night around 7pm. Once school starts in August I will have him Sunday night to Friday after work and she will have him on the weekends. That is going to be a big change for him. Any advice on how to ease him into this transition?
realitytvismytherapy	2021-04-27 13:58:52+00:00	What’s it like on the other side?	"Parents of strong willed toddlers / preschoolers who have lived to tell the tale... does it ever get easier? And WHEN??? 😭 My feisty 4 year old is certainly much more mature than he was at 3 years old (3 was brutal!) but he still has a long ways to go. He just gets so mad and cranky sometimes! We’ve tried every parenting tip in the book, have worked with professionals (he has anxiety, selective mutism, and “gifted” (school’s words) intelligence), and we’re honestly just at a complete loss. He is such a sensitive kid who feels his emotions very strongly which is good on the sweet side of things (he’s so loving, empathetic, and kind) and bad on the other side of things (he can be so grumpy, irritable, bossy, unreasonable, etc.) It’s like his sensitivity is a blessing and a curse at this age. He’ll be 5 soon and I’m hoping there will be some more significant improvement next year. He wants so badly to do the right thing but when he gets upset in the moment, it’s like he just can’t control his emotions at all and all his progress goes right out the window. Some days, he is a delight! Other days, it’s like he wakes up on the wrong side of the bed and is moody all damn day. On those days, every little thing sets him off. I guess it’s better than when he was 3 and every day was a challenge. But it’s still very tough, especially lately when the moody days are far outweighing the good days. We’ve got a baby at home who’s going through a clingy phase and it’s just all very overwhelming right now. Does it ever get easier / better?"

I have a good rapport with her step dad too. My daughter is usually with me on the weekends and at mom's during the week, although lately with covid, she's been over during the week some too. My problem is that my daughter often misbehaves and is disrespectful and mean when she's at mom's house. She is always super chill when she's with me and I rarely, if ever, have to get on her about stuff. She's got two half-sisters at mom's house that are younger. They're both hyper and loud and my daughter, especially being a teenager now, can't stand them. Her mom is also not a neat and tidy person. Her house is always a disaster. It's not unsanitary, but there's always crap everywhere. That house is extremely chaotic whereas mine is quiet and peaceful. It's not like she's on vacation when she's with me though. She has chores, school work, etc. I think she's just miserable a lot of the time that she's at mom's house, causing her to act out or be in a foul mood. I'm not really sure how to deal with this. I don't want to offend her mom or stepdad by implying that these issues are their fault exclusively, but I really feel like they need to take a step back and realize that they promote a chaotic and stressful environment at their house. They aren't bad parents by any means. My daughter is well taken care of. But this bad behavior is getting worse and worse. And now stepdad is texting me all the time that I need to come get her. They're also well aware that we don't have these issues at my house. Does anyone have any tips on how to approach this situation? I'm at a loss. My daughter says sometimes that she wants to live with me all the time but I know for sure that she doesn't mean it. Thanks for reading."
RussellZoloft	2021-04-27 13:32:24+00:00	Our family cat doesn't seem to have too much time left. . .	"Our son is almost 4.  The cat has been part of his life since day one.  He learned how to crawl by chasing the cat around the house.  Our cat is about 18, and seems to be slowing down every day.  One day I'm going to come downstairs and he simply won't be with us anymore.  I'm an adult, I'm mentally prepared for it to happen, but after 18 years, I know I'm going to be broken up.

Our son has ""tv"" knowledge of death, he's sees characters die in movies and will say ""he's dead"" or something of that sort, but, hey, the next time we watch it, he's back, so he clearly doesn't understand the permanence of it.

I will never lie, that cat isn't going to live on a farm somewhere or any hogwash like that.

To those of you who've had the experience of losing a pet with a very young child, any advice you can give so I'm better prepared when it happens?

Thanks for reading!

What we like/love: orange slices, strawberry, arrowroot cookies, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, lightly seasoned ribs, eggs.

What we have an okay relationship with: broccoli (is hit or miss depending on the day, white rice, yellow rice, apple slices (green apples), French fries.

What we despise: mashed potatoes (he still hates them and will actively get mad at you if you trick him into trying it again lol), pineapple (same as mashed potatoes), kiwi.

His absolute favorites right now are mango slices (he’ll try to shove the whole thing down his throat so you have to watch him like a hawk), the arrowroot cookies (he has quite a few teeth so it think it’s the chewing factor), and he still really enjoys bananas on occasion.

It’s hilarious to watch him make faces at things he doesn’t like! Mashed potatoes still produces the same result and the same look of absolute betrayal that is priceless. He liked sauerkraut better! What are some notable reactions your littles have had to foods???"

My husband had my son (21 month old) for the first two days and my mom had him for the last day. When I came back, my son was so happy to see me he latched onto me like a koala in a tree, but shortly after that moment, he was throwing tantrums left and right, crying over everything for seemingly no reason. Woke up this morning and it’s been the same thing, just non-stop crying. He won’t even eat his breakfast because he’s too busy screaming, and he’s a good eater, he also angrily threw his sippy cup at me, which he’s never done.

My husband and mom said they could tell he missed me, but he didn’t act like that the entire time I was gone, so I’m assuming a lot of this behavior is attention seeking or due to stress or something. He’s also not one to throw tantrums often, he’s a pretty chill little guy. I’ve been away from him before, but not for three days, so I wonder if he’s mad at me? Anyway I took the CDC’s advice and have been ignoring the tantrums, but I honestly don’t know if I can stand the noise much longer. I fear that this is just going to be another full day of screaming and I don’t know what to do. I want him to calm down and eat so that we can both enjoy the day. Advice?"

username10661914	2021-04-27 13:16:14+00:00	My 16 year old wants to move to italy	"A few years ago he discovered his talent for dance. Long story short, he’s been recruited to attend a dance school in Bologna, Italy

His immediate reaction was very positive and excited. I’ve told him he’d be leaving his family (he’s very close to us and his siblings) and his friends, plus he doesn’t speak Italian, but he’s still adamant that he’s going to go

The thought of him alone in a country who’s language he can’t even speak terrifies me. And while his ability to make friends exceeds the rest of the families, I have no idea how independent he is. On top of that, I know these school are incredibly tough, and I don’t want him to suffer more than he has to

Plus, rather selfishly, I’m going to miss him greatly. He’s the sweetest child, so expressive and such a good brother to the others (19m,18f,14f)

I know I’ll end up letting him because it’s what he wants and I trust him to make his own decisions but it’s not sitting right with me at the moment

Also, how safe is a career in dance? I don’t want him to end up jobless in his 30s. We have a friends who owns a big dance studio and she offered him a job but my son says he’ll never fancy doing that because of the mountains of admin"

MrsBobber	2021-04-27 12:51:44+00:00	Unexpected Pregnancy	"I’ve recently found out that I’m pregnant with my second child. As much as I have been wanting another, my husband and I resolved to adopt since my first pregnancy was an absolute nightmare. If things run a similar course, I will not be capable of caring for my (almost) 2 year old right around the 6 month mark. 

I’m feeling so guilty about this. He doesn’t deserve to have mommy sick like that. We had previously been rocking him to sleep still since we weren’t planning on starting the adoption process for a couple more years- so why put him through the trauma of sleep training? Now we know that we need to, and have started to gently try- but as any parent knows, there’s nothing that feels ‘gentle’ about it. New baby is due just before Christmas, so I feel guilty that we’re ruining Christmas for him. All around I just plain feel guilty. I’ve always been someone who has felt that there’s very little excuse for unplanned pregnancy since birth control options are so plenty. Guess I’m eating my words now! Or eating my thoughts I guess, I’ve never shared that shitty judgement with anyone before really. He’s still nursing, so I’ve started to wean him as well, which has been pretty hard on him. I’m pretty much dried up now and he’s very frustrated with losing that source of comfort. 

Ugh. Parents, tell me how having number 2 went for you. How did your first react? How did you help with the transition? What can his dad and I do to make this as positive of an experience as possible?"

Magicsurroundings	2021-04-27 12:07:37+00:00	The power of the sticky note	"So like so many parents,  I’ve been struggling for a while. I have a 13 month old and a 3.5 year old, and was working from home with no help for 7 months into covid- until I got laid off. My husband sold his soul to USPS so he is rarely home these days. 

My 3.5 has been testing me to the extreme for months. I am not proud to say I have lost my cool and yelled multiple times. I have lingering PPD and have had a hard time regulating my emotions over the course of the year. Some days just feel really hard. Anyway- I knew I needed to change asap.

It’s not a perfect solution and there are still things I need to work on- but sticky notes around the house have been extremely helpful for me. It’s also kind of cheesy and I felt a little silly putting them up but 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

I tried to use some gentle parenting mantras that I resonated with. Simple things like “bring the calm”, “I am in charge of staying calm, no matter how my child behaves”, “all feelings are okay”. I put them in places where tantrums/stubbornness tend to happen most- for us that’s the kitchen and around my 3.5 year olds bedroom. 

I’ve been doing this for a week and have not yelled once. When I feel overwhelmed in the moment- I look to a sticky note and repeat the mantra before addressing my child. That’s a huge improvement for me. Yelling is just not who I am, it’s not what my kids need or deserve. Before covid I was not like this and I’m ready to move on.

Im sharing this partly for me, to mark my progress. But I’m also interested to see is anyone has other sayings they like to remember in times of tension with toddlers? Or parenting podcast recommendations? I usually have a podcast on during the day and feel one specific to parenting could help too. 

Thank you if you made it this far!"

"Over the past 2 weeks our 1 year old daughter has been screaming murder, and when I mean scream, I mean like the exorcist movie scream. We put her in her crib at around 8pm and she usually fusses a little until she falls asleep, however over the past 2 weeks, an hour or 2 into her sleep she wakes up in absolute hysterics! We try console her but it just doesn’t work, the only way she stops is if mom picks her up and lets her lay on top of her. She won’t accept me or accept sleeping next to us, she has to be on her mom. 

This is affecting our sleep and has take a toll on both of us. We don’t know what to do. 

Has anyone gone through this? Any advice? Whenever I look online I get night terror as the culprit, but she stops immediately after her mom picks her up and lays on her. 

She falls asleep on her mom and as soon as we try put her back in her crib, she wakes up screaming murder once again. Last night this went on until 4:30am. We try swapping but LO wants nobody but mommy. Our LO ended up asleep on her mom while mom was upright."

I'm going to be moving into a house close to our current one. 

We've spent time planning how we'll ensure they feel comfortable in both homes and we have room decorations for each of them.

But I'm not sure how to tell them.  Because of the move,  they'll be with us for a week and then with my sister in law.  There are a few other things happening around then as well (my wife and daughter are going to my niece's graduation - she lived with us for 5 years and I call her my half-daughter at times) so we want to tell them soon. It's a chaotic time and this won't make it better.

I love my son to death and the last thing I want is for him to feel forgoten, since i know that the new born will take alot of focus and energy probably from all of us. And my son who is 6 years older might have to stepaside alite ( he is the only child as of now) and that will probably be a big change for him.

I dont want to lose my connection to my son just becouse I have to split my attention now.

And since I only have him  every other week, and this child will be here everyday im scarred he will feel.. idk what but im just scarred.

So I know im taking out the loss beforehand here. And I dont realy know what i want from this post. maby get some input from people in simular situations?"

darknesmyolfriend	2021-04-27 09:18:06+00:00	Am I overreacting or could he be hurt?	"My son is 3 months old. Seems to be on track development wise. Very clingy to me but I’m his only involved parent.

I broke a tooth down to the gums yesterday and was able to get into the dentist fast(it was bleeding and hurting so bad)

Our neighbor drove me &amp; watched the baby for the 2 hours I was in the office.
When I came out a person I’d never met was in the back with my baby and he was screaming.
Neighbors said he just wouldn’t stop crying and her friend was trying to help.

My sons eyes were so swollen they could barely open. There was crusted stuff under his eyes.
He didn’t want to eat for about 6 hours after that and just wanted to be held.
He’s always clingy but he’s 100 times worse now.

I’m scared that something happened to him or maybe the stress of new people upset him.


Should I take him to the pediatrician?

What are signs someone abused him?

His nose was a little discolored and I keep thinking what if they pinched his nose to stop him from breathing?

Am I panicking over nothing?"
Beastmodexxlsixty9	2021-04-27 07:15:55+00:00	A hurting father!	"I have wanted to post something like this for a while but it's hard putting my thoughts and feelings into sentence form.

M/51, father of 2 teen boys. My ex wife left me almost 13 years ago. We lived together for 5.5 years and then were married for about 6.5 years.

We were very happy and never fought until the last 2 years of our marriage.  There was no infidelity,  no substance abuse, no physical abuse or mental. 

Long story short we failed each other. We couldn't seem to get on the same page anymore and found ourselves fumbling and not being able to understand where each other was coming from or what we needed from each other.

With a month of planning and help from her family she emptied out our house a d nearly everything it it while I was working a 7am to 7pm shift.

Fast forward to the hear and now. My kids live with there mom. Her and I are civil and even celebrate birthdays and Christmas together purely for our kids.

The problem is that when my oldest was 6 he was dealing with his own issues that sadly most probably have when there parents split. He had separation anxiety and it was very difficult for him when his mom dropped him off at school. There were times he didn't want to see me and at the age of 6 his mom stood in front of a family court judge who gave a ruling that if he didn't want to come spend time with me he didn't have to and I could t make him but also if he did want to his mother couldn't stop him.

So basically I've seen him without his mother present about 2 times in the last ten years. You might be thinking I'm leaving something out, there has to be a reason he won't see you. Some form of abuse, neglect, or something but I swear there was none of that.  

I'm a good loving supportive father who would die for his children. His 14 year old brother has spent every weekend for nearly 12 plus years with me. We are extremely close and I just want to the with his brother who's now 16.

I've had some heart to hearts with my oldest. He knows he can talk to me about anything. I've tried for years to spend time with him and I've exhausted myself mentally trying to figure out why he won't see me. I've asked his mother but she says she doesn't know.

If I text his younger brother I get a reply almost instantly but with his brother I get a reply about 1 out of 10 times I reach out to him. He knows where to find me when he wants a ride or new sneakers but he won't come over or go out with me or even talk on the phone.

I hurt every day because of this and I know if the boys had lived with me all this time there is no way I would allow them the choice of whether they want to see there mom or not. A 6 year old shouldn't be given that choice. It also hurts that she never tries to encourage him to see me.

She knows I'm a good dad and a good person. She knows she can trust me and despite past hurts and heartbrake we do our best to co-parent.

I'm just at a loss. I never wanted this for my family. I never could of imagined how everything has turned out and most of all having a son who shows no interest in being a part of my life 9r me in his.  I need advise or encouragement or something? 

Thanks if you've made it this far."

My ex and I have been co-parenting since 2014c and for the most part have had a good relationship. We are both remarried, my wife is very involved in the co-parenting, her husband is not. 

Tonight my ex texts my wife that our oldest is grounded because he threw her iPad and broke it. She then texts “he said he wants to live with you guys full time. And in anger/humor I said ‘Honey Dad doesn’t want you full time lol.” My wife told her that is not the case. Ex responded “I know, he said it to hurt my feelings, I can’t let a nine year old win.” Then told my wife to, “stop taking everything so seriously.”

My son has already indicated that he has resentment towards my ex because of how she left (bailed in the middle of the night) and had many several comments to his brother about it. 

My wife and I get my sons tomorrow and already have a plan on how to talk to him and reassure him that we love him and would absolutely have them with us 24/7. However, I have no idea how to address my ex and let her know just how messed up what she said was, and how inappropriate it was for her to tell my son that I wouldn’t want him.

Any advise would be appreciated, thanks.

TL:DR. My son told his mom, my ex wife, during a fight he wanted to live with me full time. Ex told him I wouldn’t want him full time. I’m pissed and need help with how to address it with her."

dita_von_toes	2021-04-27 05:54:42+00:00	14-month-old formula intake increased?	"Hi everyone! I have a 14-month-old baby girl. I pumped breast milk  and supplemented with formula until about 8 months, at which point I switched to exclusive formula. 

Around when she turned 12 months, I started tapering off her formula intake at the doctor’s suggestion. The doctor said to aim to decrease intake to about 500ml (~17oz) around 12 months, and she was doing well on just about 300-400ml, sleeping through the night which she has done since about 7-8 months.

However, a few weeks ago she had her first cold, and after this her formula intake spiked again. She started waking up sometimes at night to drink more formula, and started needing the late night feed again, which I had already dropped previously. She’s also possibly teething and learning to walk.

I’m curious what your experiences are, and if it seems normal that a baby her age would taper off formula and then need/want it again? She eats a lot of solid foods though her appetite can vary sometimes. Her weight at 12 months was 85th percentile (just under 24 lbs).

And also, how exactly does one go about more deliberately decreasing formula intake? I’ve googled this but there are so many different instructions online, not sure which is really the right way to go.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you!"

I also recently deleted most of my social media w the exceptions of Snapchat, Tiktok, and Reddit. I also play a game on my phone that I just also deleted because I feel like I waste too much time on it. Every so often I see things that make me realize how I’m not really present with my children. Sometimes them wanting to talk to me seems like too much work and I end up zoning out. I feel like complete crap because of it. I know a huge part of it is my phone and I’m trying to quit that but just playing with my children and talking to them sometimes feels like a huge chore. I love my children and I take care of their basic needs and cuddle with them and love on them. I guess I just want advice on how to be present with them and stop zoning out when they’re talking and find more enjoyment when playing with them."
sinuhe0123	2021-04-27 05:34:48+00:00	3 year old son just started touching his butt area.	"My oldest son turned 3 years old a week ago and today I noticed that he would go into his room a lot. I didn't think much of  it since he's very independent. My wife was working in the room next to his and on her way out she noticed that my son was grabbing his butt area with his undies down. She was weirded out since it's the first time she saw this behavior and told me about it. Throughout the day my son would go into his room and I would follow him very quietly to see what he would do. One time I saw he was putting a small monster truck ramp against his butt (again with his undies down) and another time (this really shocked me) he got a toy screwdriver, he was about to insert it down the middle of his butt cheeks and I made some noice so he would stop. Every time I caught him doing something with his butt he would cover his face with his hands, like if she was ashamed and run into the living room. Is this normal behavior or should I be concerned? Anyone else experiencing something similar with their kids? Any advise helps. Thanks for taking the time to read this, good day."
mikethereddit	2021-04-27 05:34:45+00:00	Youtube has been great for my kid (6M)	"I was generally opposed to the mindless surfing he wanted to do. But he's obsessed with animals, and he was learning animal facts from the videos, so supervised searching became ok. Then I noticed he was learning to spell a lot of words so he could search for stuff. Then since the animal comparison videos all reference Usain Bolt when discussing top human speed, he started learning about the Olympics and the various track and field events. The last 2 days he's been drawing dozens of pictures in honor of Jackie Joyner Kersee, who he considers a queen because she jumps the highest and the farthest and runs fastest too. I don't really know why that's changed my stance, just that I never would have thought to introduce him to famous track athletes but Youtube knew what would spark his imagination.  Still not unsupervised,  but I'm impressed and wanted to share - Youtube definitely can lead a kid down a bad path to inappropriate stuff, but it can also open up new worlds. Probably that's obvious to many but I was surprised."

Also, can you really love another child like the first?

Please give me your insight!

FYI he's homeschooled so it's not like he goes to school all day while I can be with baby. I'll need to spend time with him while I care for baby during the day."
octoberelectrocute	2021-04-27 04:36:25+00:00	Is my child's drawing disturbing? (x-posted to r/askatherapist)	"I already have my 5 year old son in therapy to deal with the trauma of my Dad's death and his father not being in his life due to addiction. His drawings are usually happy and creative but today he drew a drawing of my Dad dead. The level of detail he drew indicates my Mom told him more than he should know such as the fact that he was cremated wearing an Arkansas Razorbacks shirt under his funeral suit. We personally thought it was kind of funny the way he drew a cartoonish caricature of death with crosses for eyes and his tongue sticking out. He also drew an Arkansas Razorback on his shirt. I sent it to my Dad's sister and she got upset and thought it was disturbing. I intend to take it to his therapist but the fact that I wasn't that concerned makes me wonder if we just have a dark sense of humor as medical people or we just have a healthy idea of how a child should process death. Here is the link to the drawing.

Fistina_Aguilera	2021-04-27 04:18:07+00:00	Helping to deal with death of Grandpa	"Sorry for the text barrage;
My wife recently( a week ago)  lost her father to COVID.  About 2 weeks before, her favorite cat died, an absolute cuddle monster that has been with us through a really rough road. The loss was hard on my wife especially, because the beginning of April is the anniversary of our son's birth and one week later the same for his death. And this cat was her source of comfort through that and a series of losses.


Our daughter (31 months) understands that he is brother, she knows his pictures and that he's sleeping in his NICU incubator.  She understands his importantce to mommy and daddy and that him not being here makes us sad and that we miss him very much.  She's come up to me and said ""me miss me brother, don't be sad anymore dada"", gave me a hug patting me on the back.


She also has grasped the loose concept of them both being gone somewhere else and that kitty is cuddling with brother.


She knew grandpa was sick and at the doctors and even got to video chat with him two nights before he died and he looked good, they said I love yous and laughed.  She was at my parents and I went to take our daughter to my wife and Nana and explain what happened.  His name was never mentioned at my parent's, it was general wife's dad, or him and the word death was never used explicitly, which was intentional to have the discussion with my wife present.  From knowing he was sick and in the hospital, that people were at the hospital saying goodbye, were sad, and him being gone, she pieced together that he died.

I buckled her in and she looks at me and says momma, daddy said, no more grandpa,  grandpa gone now, grandpa die.  I was shocked that she pieced that together and we get to nanas and she tells them both she has hugs and kisses for them to not be sad anymore.  We were relieved things were going well with her understanding; until they didn't.

Shes had nightmares every night that we finally found out were about his car being there, but him not and that it made her upset and wants cuddles.  I tried letting her sit in it to help the anxiety and she keeps using the term 'lost' for him.  I think maybe she thinks he's missing and can't find his car?  But she also knows, and can use: right and right, to-too-two, and nail(finger)-nail(metal fastener)

Now she's terrified of being alone at Nana's or even being with Nana alone.  Today she was and wouldn't let her touch her, change her diaper, go for a walk once she saw his car.  She just sat there watching Nanas iPad for hours and the only response was me sad, me miss grandpa.  Obviously we all feel awful, because she just needs her granddaughter and its not happening.  We're going to try a few day break from seeing her, but if that doesn't help, im at a loss.  Maybe she just needs time to process.



And I hear her crying as I write this.
Anyone have any suggestions?"
mosh_java	2021-04-27 04:17:30+00:00	What i should have done?	"Today afternoon i was collecting my daughter (3.8 old) from the Montessori. And i was waiting outside for here, then he teacher came up with a form and telling me there was an incident with my daughter being hit another kid and the head using a TOY and she had a small bump but she is fine and nothing is serious.

The other kid: is a girl that has a special need (not sure what issue she has, but she has a special teacher all the time with her and the girl is really active an aggressive sometimes), my daughter told me before that she got scared of her before because she never leave a kid enjoying eating sweets by themselves).
Anyway.

The form was explaining the incident and i have to sign that i was i informed.

I signed as all i care that she is fine and i understand that you cannot blame kids from that age and i want my kid to understand not everything around is all the time nice.

Then my daughter came out, she looked fine but when i asked here about the incident she told me that girl hit her on the head with a mop, and we arrived home she went to the mop we have she told me: like this one.

After this i got sad, like what i have should done? Should i have reacted differently to the teacher?! That feeling of im not protecting her is eating me."
HeadIncident	2021-04-27 04:09:41+00:00	Is it weird to give my teen our old bed?	"So my husband and I are talking about getting a new mattresses for our kids. My daughter would get a new one, but my 17 year old son expressed an interest in having mine and my husbands old bed because his current mattress is a full and mine is a cal king. There is nothing really wrong with my cal king mattress except I am a plus size person and so it is kinda worn down where I sleep. This way my husband and I get a new mattress and my teen gets a bigger bed. I see this as a win-win. 

Here’s the issue is my husband thinks it is totally weird for our son to use our old bed because we have had sex on it and doesn’t want to give it to him. I think he is making it weird by making a big deal out of our kid sleeping somewhere where we’ve had sex.

What do you think Reddit?"
sadboicollective	2021-04-27 03:51:51+00:00	How do I build up my son without putting a load on his shoulders	"I know we all think our kids are geniuses and can do whatever they set their mind to. 
But for me growing up with all my family saying I was ""super smart"" or "" you'll do great things when you grow up"" i felt a huge burden on me as a teen/ young adult to the point of depression, especially when I had to drop out of high school to support my mom and sister. And realizing I am of average intelligence at best. 
I would support any career choice my son (who is barely 2 now) and life style he chooses. However I feel inclined to praise him and pump him up the way my family did (out of habit I guess) but i don't want to burden him the same way I was.
Any resources you guys may have about positive reinforcement that doesn't make him feel i expect ""greatness"" from him, just to do his utmost best at everything he does.

I don’t feel like I’ve noticed any real sleep regressions until now and I don’t know how to tell if that is what’s going on but I’m losing my mind. I have a four week old baby and in the last week my almost 2 year old son refuses to go to bed at night. It’s almost 11pm and he’s been kicking and screaming and crying for hours. He’s okay if I hold him but as soon as he’s put back in his bed it’s like he’s being murdered. I’m legitimately surprised the cops or CPS haven’t shown up to my house for a welfare check. Is this normal? Is this just some awful stage I have to wait out? Is there a way to help him get through whatever he is dealing with right now? I’m sure the addition of the baby is probably making all of his emotions project differently but I am at my wits end.
ssaskcab	2021-04-27 03:41:02+00:00	Stubborn tempered 20mo baby driving us insane!	"This may be more of a vent than anything but does anyone have any advice about how to deal with a head strong stubborn 20mo toddler? And none of this annoying ""just distract"" or ""redirect"" crap because that never works on him.

So he's our first child and has been pretty isolated growing up due to covid lock down so mostly only sees us and his grandparents predominantly so I believe it has stunted both his language and behavioral development. We try to teach him the best we can but my wife and I work full 40hr weeks and don't know if we're doing things right. He just only recently went back to daycare but the problems we have with him has only seem to have heightened when he comes home probably because he's stressed at the new environment and vents when he gets home. 

The problem we have with him is predominantly getting him to try expressing his thoughts more. We've heard him speak about 10-20 different words but he gives up so easily when we try to teach him words and has a temper that can get ignited over the littlest thing and would become fixated on it. Daycare says he's a good eater but we're skeptical cause every meal time has him throwing food away and never eating what we feed him except for the few items he likes. And what he likes is just carbs and sometimes proteins. 

When he's playing, fed, and in good spirits he's lovely. But the problems are when he he gets annoyed and frustrated with whatever. Times he would want a toy or object that we can't give to him and that will trigger a tantrum and no matter what other toy or snack or etc we give to him as a redirect he'll throw away repeatedly. Sometimes the tantrum starts cause he throw something away and he wants it back. We're trying to teach him to not throw things if he wants it so we don't give it back to him especially when it's meal time. 

It's come to the point where everytime he cries about anything and everything it's just like nails on a chalkboard and it both infuriates us and annoys us that he can't seem to progress to expressing or at the very least ATTEMPT to try express what he wants aside from pointing and groaning. He cries so often now that we honestly cannot tell when he's legitimately feeling ill.

I would characterize myself as a patient man while my wife is a hot head. But honestly I am at my wits end. I don't know if this is normal nor how to make this better for him or my wife and to ensure he doesn't become some sociopath. Sometimes I think we're hostage to him and he's torturing us with his consistent meltdowns every single day. It's gotten to the point where a day free of a meltdown is a godsend. I feel guilt for actually wanting to neglect him when he's crying for the 15th min straight of the 6th meltdown that day, but what am I to do?!"

Delllthrow	2021-04-27 02:57:07+00:00	Mother who's teenager (17M) is making money but completely unmotivated in school.	"During the lockdown, my teenage son became very adept and passionate about investing and sports betting, while also making a very substantial amount of money--over 100k since the pandemic started. However, he has since shown no motivation in school. He started off the school year getting A's and B's but has since deteriorated into not even bothering to hand in assignments that will take any considerable amount of time and does not seem to care about his grades at all. Just last week he received a 42 on a calculus test because he couldn't be bothered to pay attention at all during class or even attempt to learn any of the material. Keep in mind, he has had a 3.9-4.0 gpa throughout high school and scored a 35 on his first and only attempt on the ACT. He claims he has no interest in going to college, but I believe he is being severely shortsighted. My husband and I have the ability to pay for all of his college tuition, and he has the ability to go to a very selective college. How does he know he won't find something he truly loves doing and is passionate about in college? For what it's worth, he does understand he is very lucky he wouldn't have to take out loans, worry about finances in college, etc., but has often told me to ""save my money"" and just let him forgo a college education. I also believe he will become lazy and aimless without a real job when he becomes an adult if he doesn't go to college. My husband thinks he is basically an adult who can support himself and should be allowed to make his own decisions, but it pains me to allow him just to basically drop out of school when he so obviously has a lot of potential. I have thought about essentially forcing him to put forth more effort in school and go to college, but I have very little leverage and do not doubt he would move out immediately when he turns 18 if I did, as he has shown willingness to spend time (days/weeks) away from home before as a result of my frustration and anger directed at him due to his lack of effort and commitment in school. What can I do?"
scarabic	2021-04-27 02:34:37+00:00	My wife and I disagree about how much leash is safe to give the kids.	"I won’t say we live in a safe neighborhood because I understand there is nowhere in the world that is completely safe. But to the extent that you can live somewhere that is *more* safe, we do. It’s a sleepy, affluent town of 60k people, a large share of them retirees. I grew up here and we’ve been here about 8 years.

My wife, however, lives in what I consider a state of fear. I don’t even question her rule that our kids aren’t allowed to go to the park at the end of our block on their own. We have a 9 and 5yo and things came to a head this week because I installed a swing in our front yard (where the good tree branch is) but my wife told the kids they cannot play on it unless mom or dad are out there watching them. 

When I protested that not being able to play in our own front yard was too restrictive, she rattled off a litany of “multiple incidents of child trafficking” which have taken place in our community.  When I asked for details, it all boiled down to someone in a car tried to talk to some kids at some point. I don’t dismiss it, but neither do I think we live in a hub of human trafficking, and I don’t want to set my kids’ boundaries for life based on the fact that thanks to the wonders of Nextdoor and our PD Facebook page, we now hear about every single crime incident that occurs anywhere in our municipality.

We are kind of stuck because I don’t think she will ever allow either of them to ride their bike three blocks to visit a friend’s house, and it seems a horribly constrained and limited childhood to me.

I grew up under the “come home before dark” set of rules right here in this community (actually over in the more rough neighboring town, which is still itself pretty sleepy). Crime statistics were much higher all those decades ago. And I’m sure I saw a car roll by and pass a few words with us while we were out playing. None of that was reason to huddle indoors. I’m fine with my kids being much safer than I was but being unable to play on the yard while we are all home... that was too much.

When I asked my wife to put these reported incidents in some kind of perspective, she was outraged and asked how many incidents of human trafficking I needed to take things seriously. I asked whether it was appropriate to keep an eye out for a few weeks after such an incident, or if we had to keep our kids indoors forever. 

Clearly neither of us is looking at this right. How do you navigate this?"
mustbethedragon	2021-04-27 02:30:08+00:00	Gaslighting vs disagreeing?	"My 15 yo daughter has accused me several times of gaslighting her. I'm really struggling to get perspective with this. When I disagree with her or set a boundary, she throws this at me, and I'm really trying to check my actions. I want to understand better what gaslighting means, and I need help taking apart my thoughts about our interactions. 

Example: She went to her boyfriend's Friday evening. I asked her when she was coming home, and she responded 10:30. I texted twice when she was late, then called at 11:15 to see where she was. Her reasoning was that she meant she would leave their house at 10:30 (which would still make her late, but whatever) not be home at 10:30. This makes at least the third or fourth time she's been late or he's been late leaving here, always with an explanation as to why it shouldn't count (his sister bailed, his mom fell asleep, misunderstanding).

She just now asked if she could see him this week since she'll be gone over the weekend. I told her that there would be a clear time that I expected her home and a consequence for being late. She got mad, saying there was a good reason for every time she was late. I responded that it's been a consistent pattern ever since she started hanging out with him a few weeks ago. She accused me again of gaslighting her because we didn't agree on what ""coming home at 10:30"" meant and because I ""cut her off"" when she wanted to go through ALL the explanations again (which I have already listened to and there's no new info about).

Here's how I see this interaction:
I disagreed about the meaning of coming home at 10:30
I'm irritated at her repeatedly being late with preventable excuses
I feel like I'm the only one concerned whether she gets home on time
I've already heard her explanations 
I want to know that she'll be home when she says she will next time she goes to his house

My question: Am I gaslighting her? Where's the border between boundaries and gaslighting?"
NerdyDadGuy1981	2021-04-27 02:09:01+00:00	Please don't forget that Dads are co-parents too	"I don't know where else to put this so I guess I'll drop it here for anyone that might listen.

Without getting into detail, today was really tough and involved a medical emergency with one of our kids while they were at school.  I got there as fast as I could, before my wife, and the whole vibe was one of ""mom will be here soon to decide what we need to do next"" with me right in the room.

I calm my child down, give the info to the paramedics, ask for details about what happened, etc.  My wife gets there, we sort it out with the pediatrician and we're on our way.  Later on facebook she gets messages about how awesome a mom she is, how tough a day that must have been, etc.

Now, I know none of this is malicious or intentional.  The people at the school are awesome and I have nothing but respect.  And, I love that they support my wife... and they know her more so of course they're going to show that support compared to me who is only involved in school activities outside of the typical school day (my wife picks the up and drops them off so knows them better).

But, as a dad it still sucks a lot to go through something traumatic like today and not have a single person ask how you're doing or give any encouragement at all while watching my wife get comfort and support.  

When I talked to her about it she didn't have anything to say except ""I'm sorry..."".

Makes me feel like I'm doing thing wrong as a Dad.  So, please, don't forget about us too."

I’ve heard from another momma that their baby is having trouble sleeping. Mine, 9 months, woke up an hour after she was put down and will not be going back to sleep anytime soon. She never does that. 

Could be teething but I’m definitely blaming the moon. (JK)

Our dogs are walking around like they are lost and the chickens aren’t asleep yet either at almost 10pm. Has the full moon affected you house too? I’m very curious if this is a real phenomenon or an old wives tale."

Kids have spent maybe half a year around him, she moved in with him this last weekend. He is really good to the kids, they always wanna just go to his place. I'm very comfortable with him and so are the kids. I just don't know when it's appropriate for them to stay at their place basically. Thoughts? And also she hasn't explained my to youngest sleeping arrangements 3 year old girl, and a 11 month old boy. Our oldest boys has their own room with beds."
sandqueenoverlord	2021-04-27 01:23:47+00:00	It's so embarrassing.. my four year old is the rock thrower	"He's four years old. This has been a new thing. We have new neighbours that live  behind us that we share a fence with. He's allowed to play outside with the neigjnour kids if he wears a mask. And lately, he's co fessed to throwing rocks. The first time, I heard what had happened. The boys (who are like five and seven) started calling him names and taunting him. They called him a baby, a weirdo, and an idiot, and kept calling him a girl even after he had said ""I'm not a girl, I'm a boy with long hair."" I went out and said ""let's play nice, everyone. We all want to have fun, right? Please no name calling."" It continued, and then my son came in crying, and told me, ""Mama, you're not going to like this. I threw rocks at those boys. I got so mad! I was so frustrated! They hirt my feelings, Mama. They keep calling me names and being mean to me. And I threw rocks at them."" He had a time out, and I made him apologize. 

Fifteen minutes go by, some other neighbour kids come out (the upstairs neighbors of the house behind us). They get along with my son. For a while, I hear talking and giggling. But then I start to hear one of the other boys yell ,again,""You're a baby! You're a weirdo! Go away, baby! You idiot!"" And sure enough, my son comes inside crying and tells me he threw rocks again. So I grounded him for the night. I told him that I agreed that it was not nice of those boys to call him names, but that it was not okay to throw rocks at them. I told him he was grounded because he did it again after apologizing and saying he wouldn't do it again. I explained that, the biggest reason he was in trouble was because what he did was dangerous. 

Now, tonight, it happened again. He was outside for maybe ten minutes tops. He came inside, told me he threw rocks at the boys again because he wanted to play with his dump truck with them, and they said it was stupid and that he was stupid. I go outside to go get his truck after grounding him for the night, and the boys father said ""Can you not let your kid throw rocks at my boys? He almost him them!"" I said ""Yes, that's why he's coming inside, he's grounded for the night"" I didn't really know what else to say, and I felt really embarrassed. 

I don't know what to do. He gets grounded for the night. And he does it again. I've told him to just stay away from them. But he isn't in daycare, and I guess he's desperate for friends. I've tried telling him that each time he tries to be friends with them, they don't want to, and they end up being mean. I really don't know what to do now. Like.. I can't have my four year old play in our backyard anymore? Every single time he goes out there, those boys pick on him. He just wants to be friends. He tries to share his toys through the fence (something I've been trying to get him to not do). He just wants to play and make friends. And I don't know. He has long hair, so he's being made fun of? Is this what Kindergarten is going to be like? He is going to get grounded and have time-outs every time he does something not okay or not safe. Name calling, hitting, spitting... it's a time out until it happens more than once. Then it's inside for the night. I just feel like I don't know what else to do. I'm at a loss. I've never had this happen before. Any input or others stories would make a Mama feel better. Thank you for reading!"
riceisright56	2021-04-27 01:23:03+00:00	Our 3-year-old won't stop reciting books he likes.	"Pretty much what it says. He's gotten into a phase where he almost never seems to listen or respond to what we're saying, and instead just recites and reenacts books that he likes. It was cute at first but it's starting to become annoying and at times worrisome. Has anyone else run into this? What did you do?"
booknerd381	2021-04-27 01:18:37+00:00	Only The Pink Yogurt...but they stopped selling it	"My son loves yogurt.  He's been getting fairly picky about foods lately, and one of the odd things he's recently started doing is that he'll only eat the pink yogurt.  Yogurt is like, one of six foods I can get him to eat, so learning that suddenly only the pink yogurt will do has been a bit of a head ache.

This weekend after I learned about the pink yogurt debacle I decided I better go to the store and stock up because now we're only using half the pack of yogurt, and I'm greeted with an isle free of pink yogurt.

Specifically, it's the Yoplait kids yogurt.  There used to be eight packs that came with two flavors in each pack.  This weekend, though, every single package was one of the ""mixed flavor"" varieties that come with two colors in a single cup.  That was what caused the problem last week (there's no explaining that strawberry banana has pink yogurt in it when there's yellow yogurt in the same cup, and mixing it just makes orange).

I usually keep an extra pack on hand because, as I mentioned, it's one of the few things he eats so I don't like to run out if I can't get to the store for a few days, so it's been a few weeks since the last time I bought some, and a few weeks more since the last time I bought the non-mixed flavor cups.

I really hope the pink yogurt comes back.

In the meantime, does anyone have any recommendations for other brands of pink yogurt I might try?  I'm down to three cups of pink left, so we'll be out by this weekend."

He still fits it but he’s def outgrowing it. A friend of ours donated a Britax Clicktight car seat that has both a rear and front facing option, with the front facing option starting at 20lbs. So per their, guidelines he should be safe to face forward. We wanna go ahead and  install this new car seat not only because my son is growing, but because he gets car sick and I’m wondering if facing him forward would help. I looked up an article about it, but they say that you’re supposed to keep them rear facing until they outgrow the convertible car seat (65lbs for mine). 

When did y’all start facing your kids forward? Do you think it’s too early for me to turn him around? Per his last doctor’s visit, he’s about 30 inches, if that helps."
bjnowtmj2mrw	2021-04-27 00:44:24+00:00	My 12yo son wants to stay at dads	"I divorced my ex when my son was just a toddler.  it was amicable and we aimed to make everything fair. Time between our homes were split down the middle of the week(3 days plus everyother sunday). Ive always lived on my own and then eventually with my now husband and two little ones.  While my son's dad remained at his childhood home with his parents. My son's grandfather is a sick man and needs to do dialysis in a hospital setting 3 times a week. 

Last year was challenging for everyone. I was making sure our household was safe knowing if we were to transmit anything through my son, grandpa would have a very hard time. We were still alternating visits until December. When my son came for his turn at my home when I got the call from his dad saying the grandpa tested positive for covid.  I was scared. I had a newborn and a toddler. My son left with his father after spending the day with us. My husband tested negative. My son and ex tested negative and quarantined for two weeks. Then their second test, just after new years, was positive. To say the least my son was at his dads until March. I consulted with my doctor and he gave the greenlight for my son to come back home saying he has immunity for a few months. My husband prefers an extended rotation, one month between households.  My ex(not willing to change at all) and I temporarily changed the schedule to a weekly visit (I was hoping to compromise at 2 weeks). 

Now the numbers are going up in my city and surrounding areas and my husband is saying one month rotation or none at all. 

I've spoken to my son about staying here for a month and he doesn't want to change the schedule. At first he said even two weeks would have been too long. He says he doesn't mind and would rather stay at his dad's. He says he likes it better there. More electronics and later bedtimes. Even though I have the two little ones, I always included him as much as I can. Doing activities here and there like baking, video games, board and card games. 

Ive been trying to explain that our house would be safer for him but he still wants to stay with dad. I told him that if he chooses to go to his dad's come the end of this turn he might have to stay much longer than intended. He wants to stay until end of August. I feel like I'm losing him. I want him to be safe and I know that because we are doing everything we can to remain so. I don't know why I'm posting this.  To vent I guess."
RoxyMcfly	2021-04-27 00:05:40+00:00	I feel so bad for my 4.5 year old	"My poor daughter has been home for a year. Summer wasn't too bad because even thought I was working from home, she was able to play and swim at my parents while I worked.

Her daycare was where I worked so it was closed.

Come September I tried enrolling her prek near home. Due to anxiety about naps, because she stopped them once she was home and they made her lay down she was crying the whole nap time ans refusing to go. So I took her out when the school said she had to and wouldn't let her color quietly.

So she has been home with me ever since. She is bored. She is demanding. She wants my attention all day every day. However my work is demanding. I have meetings and calls. I tried so many things like getting her learning books to help her right and learn number and letter recognition. I got her a laptop to do hooked on phonics. I have purchased toys and other activities. Everything I could do I have tried but she just doesn't want me to work.

She also has sensory processing disorder, which makes disciplining difficult. She is in OT, and also has a cognitive therapist she sees. Like I am doing everything I can to get and keep her on track.

The reason I feel so bad tonight is that although she literally doesn't listen to anything we say, ignores us when we are talking to her, just defies us at every turn, I feel bad cause I think she feels like she can't do anything right. I don't want her to feel that way. We always praise her when she does listen and does what she is supposed to like not throwing her food on the floor or behind the couch just cause she is done. When she helps us clean up all the messes she makes. But those things are rare and no matter the approach, no matter how gentle or stern we are as soon as I go to speak to her about throwing food she puts her hands over her ears and says I'm scaring her. I'm not yelling, I'm not being mean. 

How do you try to discipline without having to tell them every time they are doing something they are not supposed to do, when all they are doing is blatantly doing it?

How do I be better?"

Delllthrow	2021-04-26 23:40:24+00:00	Teenager (17M) is making money but completely unmotivated in school as a result.	"During the lockdown, my teenage son became very adept and passionate about investing and sports betting, while also making a very substantial amount of money--over 100k since the pandemic started. However, he has since shown no motivation in school. He started off the school year getting A's and B's but has since deteriorated into not even bothering to hand in assignments that will take any considerable amount of time and does not seem to care about his grades at all. Just last week he received a 42 on a calculus test because he couldn't be bothered to pay attention at all during class or even attempt to learn any of the material. Keep in mind, he has had a 3.9-4.0 gpa throughout high school and scored a 35 on his first and only attempt on the ACT. He claims he has no interest in going to college, but I believe he is being severely shortsighted. My husband and I have the ability to pay for all of his college tuition, and he has the ability to go to a very selective college. How does he know he won't find something he truly loves doing and is passionate about in college? For what it's worth, he does understand he is very lucky he wouldn't have to take out loans, worry about finances in college, etc., but has often told me to ""save my money"" and just let him forgo a college education. I also believe he will become lazy and aimless without a real job when he becomes an adult if he doesn't go to college. My husband thinks he is basically an adult who can support himself and should be allowed to make his own decisions, but it pains me to allow him just to basically drop out of school when he so obviously has a lot of potential. I have thought about essentially forcing him to put forth more effort in school and go to college, but I have very little leverage and do not doubt he would move out immediately when he turns 18 if I did, as he has shown willingness to spend time (days/weeks) away from home before as a result of my frustration and anger directed at him due to his lack of effort and commitment in school. What can I do?"
EstelSnape	2021-04-26 23:40:23+00:00	How do I deal with a grumpy grandpa?	"For some context my dad (71m) fell on the ice Jan 2017. He suffered from a brain bleed and since then his temper has been on a hair trigger and he has trouble filtering his thoughts at times.

My (36f) husband (34m) went on an overnight business trip yesterday and my parents wanted to help me by taking my girls (4&amp;2) for the night while I kept the baby at home. 

As far as I knew the girls were good last night and this morning. It wasn't until I met up with them for dinner that they said my 2yr old had been difficult (saying no, being a 2yr old). At dinner she was tired and acting up. I was going to bring all 3 home but mom wanted to take the girls home with them to bathe them and bring them back to me. 

I wasn't keen on that because I saw dad was getting cranky but he got crankier when I said I was going to take them with me. 

2yr old was not pleased and was being resistant toward my dad. He got upset and said ""You are just not a good kid!""

It hurt to hear him say that. Yes she was being difficult but nothing out of the normal for a 2yr old. 

I don't know what to think. It hurts that dad says things like that out of the blue. How do I proceed with my dad?"
Complex_River	2021-04-26 23:11:04+00:00	Is it really that bad to raise a kid vegetarian?	"I was raised vegetarian and have never had meat and so I'm raising my kid vegetarian as well. I see this no different than raising a kid with any other personal values I want to share. 

However, I get regularly and severely criticized for doing so and I dont understand why. People, even complete strangers, have even gone so far as to try and convince or trick her into doing it. 

I make sure she has a healthy balanced diet and that she would never judge anyone else for their dietary choices or personal values, but these things are never the things being criticized. 

She's only 5, but she knows that if she ever wanted to I wouldn't judge her and it's always up for discussion if she wants. 

I have heard everything from ""she will be a social outcast"" or ""she will resent you"" to people basically implying (or a few times outright saying) that its abusive for me to force her to miss out. 

Is there something I'm missing here? It seems super weird that SO many people are SO critical of something that doesn't affect them at all. I've kind of started to feel insecure about it because I hear it from other parents, family, and strangers alike. 

Does anyone have any insight? Am I actually doing something wrong just because it was done to me? Why is this so open for criticizing when other value-based personal matters are not?"

thebadmommm	2021-04-26 22:59:39+00:00	"I [26F] think I’m going to give my Ex full custody of our kids [3F, 4F]."	"I gave birth to my daughters 13 months apart. I was 22 and 23 when I had them. Their dad and I have had a decent life together over the years, but our relationship should not have lasted more than six months. For some reason, it dragged on for six long years. 

We split up in October for various reasons. No matter what he says, he is emotionally and sometimes physically abusive towards me. I was the one that made the difficult decision to move out. He STILL wants me back, even after we settled our case in court. 

Right now, we have a 50/50 custody arrangement of the kids. He pays a couple hundred a month in child support, mainly because he makes almost three times more than I do. He also has a paid-off 3 bedroom house for the kids and 3 paid-off cars. 

Meanwhile, I’m living with my parents. I recently got a new car in my own name, but I feel like it’s not enough. I can’t help but think that the kids would be so, *so* much better off if I just fucked off forever.

**They can live at their house with their dad, and I’ll just pay whatever I can in child support and see them every other weekend.** That’s my loose plan. I can better myself, fix my mental health, get a better job, get my own place and maybe get more custody of the kids after a few years time. 

I’ve had PPD for years, but now I think it’s just full blown depression. I have a sneaking suspicion that I have a touch of bipolar/mood disorders mixed with suicidal ideations. I’ve also been extremely hypersexual. Something bad is going to happen to me. 

I had kids young with someone that essentially begged me to get pregnant. I’m very nice and a pushover at times, so I thought everything would be okay. It was okay for awhile, but our second daughter broke me in every way possible. I no longer feel like an actual person. I feel invisible. I feel like I’m just floating through life without actually living it. I’m like a spirit that’s already passed on, but I’m still living in a body. 

I sleep constantly. I can barely take care of myself. I’m a functional alcoholic. I want my freedom back. I have a small amount in savings, but it’s not enough to get anywhere. I’m completely uninterested in my kid’s lives. Those are a few of my negative feelings. 

At this point, I don’t see a way out other than giving him full-ish custody of our daughters. I need to make more money. I don’t want us to live with my parents forever, even though they don’t really mind. My mental health is in absolute shambles, and I’m not a good mom in any way right now. 

Has anyone dealt with this? Is this a good idea? I don’t know what else to do."

You_Are_Doing_Great	2021-04-26 22:43:02+00:00	Is it selfish to sleep in different rooms so one of us gets a full night's sleep?	"My wife and I are adjusting to having our newborn daughter.  She is almost 4 weeks old now, but has several medical issues that require extra care.  In particular she has a feeding pump and special medications that need to be given to her at certain times of the day.  For her feeding, she needs fed every 3 hours.  We have alarms set on our phones to remind us, especially during the night.  During the day it's not too terrible, but it's much harder to do at night.  We have a basinet on one side of our bed so one of us can keep an eye on her.

Basically once our alarm goes off, one of us needs to get out of bed to get her formula warmed up, mess with her tube to make sure it's good, then start the pump.  She feeds for an hour, after which another alarm goes off to tell us to turn it off and to flush her tube.  At night this means we are both being woken up at 12, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 in the morning.  I was off work for a week while she was home, so I got into a good routine to manage all that.  I would often take naps during the day, because she tends to be up all night.  However, now I am back working and it's been really rough.

I work anywhere from 50-60 hours a week, and 10-14 hour days.  She doesn't work, so her job is the stay at home mom.  Sometimes I will have to close and then open the next day.  This means I would only get around 6 hours of sleep if I am lucky.  With the baby in the picture, I am not getting any sleep.  I have been slow getting back into the swing of things at my job.  I actually dozed off in the office the other day while working on paperwork.  This has never happened before.

I haven't asked me wife this.  I'm afraid I am being selfish, and I need some opinions from you all.  On days that I work, would it be asking too much to sleep on the couch so I am not woken up by alarms and a crying baby?  I would be happy on days I don't work to be the one to work the pump and stuff during the night.  I feel like my wife has the luxury of being able to take naps during the day to catch up on sleep, which I can't do.

So please tell me what you think.  Is this reasonable to ask?"
student-momther	2021-04-26 22:34:26+00:00	Starting daycare. What are some things you did to help ease the transition?	"My daughter is two, and I was a SAHM for the first year of her life. A family member then started caring for her, and she picked up some truly terrible habits. She has a hard time respecting me due to this family member basically coddling her. Additionally, the only children she’s had interaction with were the neighbors of this family member. They rough house BAD and had her cussing at one point (thank god I nipped that in the bud ASAP). She desperately needs structure and better playmates. 

I’ve spent nearly two months researching and observing at daycares in my area. I finally found one that has excellent staff who diligently follow CDC guidelines. The owner seems organized and she has run this daycare for thirty years. She also made it clear she would help us nail down a structure for my daughter to improve some of the bad behavior. 

My daughter is incredibly smart and sweet, but I’m worried this transition will be hard on both of us. I’m hoping parents out there with wild toddlers can give me some helpful tips, or maybe just assure me I’m stressing over nothing haha! TIA!!"

WersomeFacts	2021-04-26 22:26:06+00:00	Toddler Tantrum and Bath Time	"Hey

So any advice to help. I’m at the end of my rope and I don’t know what to do anymore.

Big long backstory. So we don’t have a bath tub in our house so we used a newborn tub then sink then a inflatable pool in the shower. My LO always loved bath time and it was special time if not a little back breaking but it was easy. She never liked the shower and was always wary of it. The few times we tried it she was sad and scared the whole time.

Anyway about a month ago I asked my Mum when she was around to stand by the sink and fill the shampoo rinser with sink water so that I’m not tipping soapy water on her hair so rinsing her hair is quicker. Now my daughter loves tipping buckets of water on her head and rinsing has always been a grizzle but non issue but when she started to grizzle my Mum swooped in and rescued her, winding her up and now she won’t get in the bath since.


I’ve tried getting her cousins in with her, bath crayons so she can draw on the walls while playing in water, small watering cans, goggles since she spent an arvo wearing mine, animal bath mit, cow sponge, her foam shower shield hat thing, giving her the buckets from outside she likes tipping on herself. Not even had soap or anything during any of this just trying to make the bath area a happy place. Got out her newborn tub, called it a boat, let her play with it for a few days before filling it with water and making bath slime in it. Put a giant inflatable pool up and got in with her. 

Nothing works. Even if I eventually convince her to get in the minute I try and help wash her or even get her to do it herself she flips out and wants Nan. She’s 2 next week so not that reasonable I can’t just tell her to sit in the bath. She cries and trembles and just sobs and breaks my heart. I can’t even bird bath her with cloths because, even tho I was getting her to wash me too, the minute my mum said the word wash she broke down again. I can’t even get close to getting her hair wet to wash it. I’ve taken her to my grandparents where they have a bathtub and still nothing. 

I’ve even taken to leaving the doors open when I’m in the shower so she can come in at her own pace and look but she freaks out if she comes too close. 

I don’t know what else to do. I can’t not bath her and it’s coming up to a month of trying everything above and she hasn’t had a proper wash. I can’t force her either cos even tho she’s almost 2 she’ll only listen to directions to a certain degree and I can’t hold her down in water especially since she’d fight and wriggle and sob. 

I don’t know what else to do. Is this normal? Will she phase out of it? I got a new rinser shield off Amazon which doesn’t strap around her head you just kind of hold it like a visor but she won’t get in the water. Filled her newborn tub today and we washed her baby doll but she wouldn’t get in and constantly wanted to dry off.

I don’t think it’s a sensory thing. She still loves her outside pool and dumps buckets on herself out there. (And I don’t want to try wash her in the pool because I don’t want her happy place to become another thing she’s scared of). She loves being wet. It’s the washing concept. She’s fine with the cloths at meal times for her hands and face so she hasn’t suddenly gone off the feel of them. She loves using soap in the bathroom to wash her hands.

My theory is she figured out from my Mum scooping her out that if she works herself up enough she doesn’t have to do it and she’s right but I need a solution. We can’t keep going like this and doing nothing.

And it’s not just a few tears I’m sad, it’s end of the world sobbing screaming begging for Mumma scrambling to get out scared broken down tantrum. 

Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated!!!

TLDR: toddler won’t bath. Don’t know what else to do."

I seem to not be capturing their attention when I read. What can make it more captivating to them? 

Things I've tried: 

* Modulating my voice 
* Reading ""dialogue"" in a different voice 
* Asking them side questions about the characters, setting, etc (etc ""Look, Daffy is going to bed! Do YOU like going to bed?"")"

Consequences so far are not a winning strategy so we want to shift to a reward-based system.  We are hoping there’s some magical app out there that makes doing chores and earning points or money (allowance) easy for him and us. What do you all use?

I asked her where her shoes were that said puppy got hold of them because her room door is supposed to be shut to prevent this.

There's a neighbor down the street w/ a same aged kid that we see sometimes and play with, usually outside in the park. My kid wanted a playdate so we offered the invite for the mom to drop off the kid here for a playdate. Win-win-win, right? the kids get to play and the parents get some time to themselves.

Well, she insists on staying with her kid because she 'doesn't do well with alone time' and just won't take no for an answer.

Anyone else deal with this? How to give this other mom a reality check?"

I am considering taking a trip, 10 hours one way, to see extended family.  My parents will be driving and have invited me and my babygirl along.  I have no idea how to travel with little ones. 

She is exclusively breastfed, but does well with sippy cups and solid foods. 
My husband and I have yet to travel with her, thanks COVID, so this will be her first trip longer than an hour.

mammothswoon	2021-04-26 20:54:36+00:00	So today my almost 3YO son asked me why I don’t have a mummy	"I cut off my abusive mum about 9 years ago and thankfully don’t think about her that often anymore. However today my son just turned around to me and said “where’s your mummy, daddy?”

I tried to keep it as vague as possible and told him not everyone has mummies or daddies and that’s okay. Obviously he’s almost 3 so he asked why about 67 times but I just reassured him I’d always be around.

Thankfully I’m raising one of the sweetest little people and he just gave me a kiss on the head and went back to playing with his toys 

It’s a conversation I’ve always dreaded, I know it will come back up when he’s more aware of everything in a few years and eventually I’ll have to explain things a little more, but I didn’t expect it today. 

How has that conversation gone for any of you guys?"
theoriginalbill	2021-04-26 20:27:40+00:00	Strategies to motivate kids to take initiative and solve more of their own problems?	"I have 3 kids ages 7 to 12. I'm struggling to get my children to take initiative on their personal goals and self-direct. When they have goals, they frame them in such ways that basically mean they want, need, or expect me to achieve an outcome for them. They express a sense of feeling abandoned and not cared for when I don't respond to their baby bird calls for assistance on things that are age-appropriate for them to now be doing on their own.

When I see them figure out how to navigate entertainment apps and games that require complex steps and problem-solving in exploratory ways - I think that they are in fact competent to apply their problem-solving skills and get the same work-reward feelings.

These kids are also all making A's in school, they are on track in all areas, they can listen to instructions and follow them. They are the first in their classes to complete their work, they all get resounding positive feedback in parent-teacher conferences. They get feedback on how they actually help the teachers complete tasks, all show self-initiative to accomplish tasks on their own and even help others in the class. All without being called upon to do so. 

However, they are not willing to be competent to manage basic self-care and life skills at home. 

What are some successful strategies parents have used to successfully motivate their kids to apply themselves to their goals in the real world? 

Examples - General Life Skill Problem Solving

1. Repeatedly asking where things are when they have been told and shown multiple times. Basic items. Tape, scissors, writing instruments, masks. It's literally all in one area. It sometimes feels like they are condescending to me as follows: ""I need such and such"" ... well ok, go get it, why tell me what you need? ""well where is it"" uhh.. where it always is when we have this conversation. This feels like a baby bird who just refuses to chew up its own worm. 
2. Completing craft or other project goals that they claim look interesting but then want to quit when there's some technical aspect that requires a few prep steps or extra effort/practice. Need to rewind a youtube video to get a certain technique down? Forget it. Need to clean off a table from an old project to start a new one? Nevermind, I'll do it later (never does it). But then child drags around the house complaining that they're bored--annnnd that they want to do the craft idea. What? No. Go back and finish the thing that was challenging you to be engaged... 
3. Building outdoors - want to build a lean-to fort against the tree after seeing some pics online? Cool. We go into the woods and collect a lot of building materials - get home - child stares at it and keeps asking 'what do I do now what do I do now?' Told to just start and see where it goes, feel it out. No... instead puts a few things together with spaghetti-like muscle movement, then abandons it altogether - would not even tie some sticks together after given some pointers and beginner steps (translating geometry class and building a 3D structure starting with the faces), I try getting paper to encourage them to draw out some ideas first. I encourage them to fail so they can hone. Nothing works. Shrugging limp shoulders unless I do it myself FOR them.
4. Figuring out what they want to eat and putting that food together - stop telling me you're hungry and that you don't know what you want to eat and rejecting every option I can think of and saying ""IDK"" after any questions and not even really getting up to look around at what's available, but then once settled on an item - become apathetic and obstinant to putting that food together/learn how to put a new food interest together so it can be done independently in the future...
5. Cleaning up space so that it can be available for new activities proactively - really bad attitudes on how to manage their own stuff. Wanna take all of your stuff out for playing and projects? Great go for it - get lost in your creative fantasies. Time to throw everything back where you got it? Not a chance - having a conniption that it's 'too hard.' How is it too hard to put something in your hand to go from point A to B but then not point B to A? The kids have bins and well-organized space. I've made it as simple as possible. It's a matter of general sorting. Craft bin. Toy bin. Book bin. Play blankets/stuffies bin. Done. Instead what I find is an array of legos, magnet blocks, colored pencils, stuffed animals, empty water bottles even sometimes - all scrapped into an empty laundry bin or stuffed in a wooden baby play cradle, or piled on a dresser. What? Why? Why would you place these items in these places instead but it's too hard to put them back where you got them from? Just why? That seems like obstinant defiance.

When this sour, vagrant attitude is multiplied by 1 to all 3 kids at any given phase of most days, it emotionally and psychologically buries me. 

I've tried passively helping, explaining, reasoning, talking about the benefits of evolving into independence and self-direction. I've ad nuaseam ensured my children that they are not in fact living in a dystopian world with a tyrant ruler forcing them into slave labor. I have even had the pediatrician discuss with them that these are all appropriate milestone skills that they should be proud to tackle and dominate. 

They don't behave this way with other adults. It is just with me. They are like puppies aging off the teat and they just won't shake off. They want me to do EVERYTHING for them and to coddle them. And they are falling behind on their milestones seemingly willing to die on the hill of this warped view that if I'm not doing EVERYTHING for them at home--their own hobbies and self-directed developments of their own passions--that they are neglected and unloved and nothing is worth learning for self-direction, self-satisfaction, and self-accomplishment. Whut.

Looking for word-specific things to tell them, and action-specific strategies to apply?"

So everything went will the driver picked them up today. I emailed the teachers to let them know that they will taking the bus. When they got home, I was expecting a phone call or at least to hear the driver honk the horn so that I can get the kids off of the van... nope! I get a know on the door an hour and half after school let's out, and when I open it, it's my kids at the door BY THEMSELVES. I live in an apartment building and the front door is locked and you have to be let in. 

I ask my kids where is the driver and they say that he left once a stranger let them in the building 🤯 I didn't get any notification AT ALL that they were outside and had no time frame of when they will be home. My son the proceeded to tell me that when they got to school he just dropped them off in front of the school building. My 5yo is in Kindergarten and needs to be walked into the back of the building to get to his class room and my oldest goes in through a different door entrance they were left to walk themselves to class. No teachers helped assist or walk them either. I'm furious!"

GirlLunarExplorer	2021-04-26 19:44:01+00:00	How do i find the best preschool for my 3.5 YO autistic son?	"I need some advice on verbiage when making initial contact with potential preschools.

We are increasingly thinking of pulling our son from his current pre-school/daycare, where he's been going since 4 months old.  The teachers are generally fine, although lately seem a little overwhelmed, but the director has made me cry on more than one occasion.  She's just... so ... bitchy? We worked with her a few months ago to get a therapist/aide (provided by us, paid by our own insurance) into daycare with our son so that we could work on social skills, as he's usually off on his own not making friends and not attending to some of the learning tasks (art class, games, etc).  That therapist left and we had to wait 2 months for a therapist to become available, and she was only available in the afternoons.  The director did not like this and has asked me repeatedly to make the therapist come in the morning, as if I have control over her schedule.  Anyway, apparently she's been very difficult to work with, talking with the other teachers in Spanish about the therapist even when the therapist is there, interfering with how therapy is running, acting differently when the therapist's supervisor is observing the session, etc. We just got word this morning our therapist essentially quit, leaving us down to 1 other aide who is in daycare with him 1x a week, (the other 2 days at home).  I'm so mad and upset, partly because the therapist shouldn't have to suffer this type of working situation, but partly because my son loved working with her and now we'll have to find someone new all over again.

We are planning a return to office sometime over summer/fall, so I need for him to be back in daycare full time, so doing all therapy sessions at home isn't really an option.  This also doesn't allow the therapist to work on specific social goals like cooperative/parallel play with kids his own age.  The thought of moving to a different school is really stressing me out but I just can't imagine this back-and-forth with the current director is good for anyone.  What happens if she behaves similarly to the next aide, and that one leaves too?

I've made a list of potential preschools in our area, some centers/some home preschools, but i'm afraid of contacting them about having an autistic child who needs an aide to be with him because I can imagine how many 'no's' I'll get, especially considering the pandemic.  (All his BTs have been vaccinated BTW). 

I need a way of writing to a potential preschool about my son's needs, in a way that makes it seem like he's not a burden (cause he isn't, he's verbal, not aggressive and a total cutie-pie).  I also need a way of requesting aide placement that doesn't shut the whole convo down.  Should I even mention it in the initial email? Like wait for a (virtual) visit with preschool and mention that he's autistic/we will be provide a therapist for you?

How do we present ourselves in the best light that make it more likely for my son to get the care/schooling he needs?"
ave_63	2021-04-26 19:36:46+00:00	The pandemic has given me an urge to move to the woods. Am I the only one?	"So last week I suddenly got an urge to quit my teaching job, sell my house in the city, buy a cheaper house somewhere rural, and start working as a programmer from home, so that I could be alone all  and do what I want with my time.

I quickly came to my senses when I realized my wife wouldn't like this, and my 6yo kid would still have to go to school. Also, I would still be living with them, so I wouldn't really be as independent as I was daydreaming about. So this is not something I'm going to do.

I still find myself fantasizing about this isolated life, and I think the reasons it sounds so good to me are:

* I'm tired of my kid being home from school all the time and constantly getting interrupted by him.
* I'm tired of talking to people on zoom, and not talking to anyone at all sounds pretty nice.

So, of course, moving with my wife and kid somewhere remote would only make these problems worse. Maybe my fantasy daydream also includes living alone without my family, but I know I would miss them and they would miss me, and nobody would be happier that way. I'm hoping that post-pandemic, I'll remember why I like living with my family, in the city, near my friends.

I'm wondering if anyone else is feeling the same way, these days."
predictablePosts	2021-04-26 19:36:02+00:00	My son is nearly 2 months in the NICU and has only seen my face a handful of the times	"Seeing parents faces has to be important for something developmental for children this young right? I'm afraid that if my son doesn't see my face or doesn't connect my voice with my face that he might not understand things correctly in the future. Like how does he know what a smile is if he only sees one any time I have the audacity to take off my mask.

I was just sitting with him in the nicu pod singing and talking with him without a mask so he can see my face and hear my voice and connect that it was my face making the noises. The nurse came up to me and said ""Please put your mask on."" and before I had a chance to put it on or even respond she followed up with ""Sorry about covid"" which kinda struck me as heartless.

It's going to be another couple of weeks at least until he can come out. I know it's less than safe to take off my mask in public but I am vaccinated and I do everything I can to stay safe otherwise. Can I really not have this moment with my child? Is it going to hurt him developmentally?"
hyperbolicHydrangeas	2021-04-26 19:35:28+00:00	Caught 13 yr old son sexting and looking for guidance	"Hello:

I need some assistance working through this situation. My wife confiscated my son's tablet yesterday and starting reading chats between him and his girlfriend. She immediately found very graphic texts between the two kids and later found explicit photos. Even before finding the photos we took away the electronic access and called the girlfriend's mom to let her know why our son was grounded and to let her know that there is a problem. I didn't go into detail when alerting the girlfriend's mom but was honest that there was an issue. 

My son and I have a good relationship; he actually let me sit with him and cry out his feelings last night. He comes to me with questions and we discuss things pretty openly. The same cannot be said for his mom though and she tends to exacerbate problems very quickly. I don't know how to help him a) navigate his relationship with his mom b) understand that his actions were inappropriate and inexcusable and c) restore trust with me since we have discussed things like sexting in the past. He assured me that he wouldn't and he knew what the consequences would be if it was discovered. I want to maintain my relationship with him and keep an open dialogue and am having a very hard time figuring out how to move forward. His mom wants him to see a pastor and, I guess, be guilted into better behavior. I think consulting a family therapist would be a much wiser move, especially given his preexisting religious doubts. 

Anyone want to take a stab at this can of worms?"
Moofabulousss	2021-04-26 19:31:32+00:00	How would you approach this?	"My close friend and I have similar aged children. My daughter is about to turn 3 and her son is 2.5. We have play dates twice a week and formed a covid bubble. Having each other and these playdates has been super helpful with socializing our kids through the pandemic. 

We do have some differences in parenting. I’m a therapist and I specialize on child behavior, parenting support and appropriate discipline. Whether by chance with my daughter’s temperament or by my experience and hard work, she’s generally a pretty well behaved kid, and we have our discipline set up well. My friend doesn’t have much support from her partner and is basically an overwhelmed single mom. There are many things we do differently as parents, and I do not judge those differences, but there has been one concern that I feel warrants a more direct conversation. 

My friends son throws toys, swings toys destructively, hits and pushes. My daughter (or my friend) is usually the target. There hasn’t been consistency in my friends discipline with her son, and he is often given no consequence or many chances to correct his behavior. This highly correlates with how overwhelmed my friend is. When she is struggling with something, she essentially ignores him, and he will act out to get attention(ie hits my kid). 

I have sometimes stepped in to separate them, I have given him direct feedback, and I have talked to him in kid friendly terms about “no hitting” or “that hurts your friend, let’s take a deep breath and go say sorry”. I’ve asked before if my friend would like a hand, but sometimes to prevent my kid getting hurt I have to step in an move them apart/do the parenting for her. I’m honestly happy to help, but I don’t want to overstep my place or make her feel judged. I offer to help when I know she is struggling, I only intervene  for her/with her kid unasked when there is potential harm to either kiddo. It got better for awhile but had become worse lately as my friend is dealing with loss of family member and is more overwhelmed. 

But I think we have hit a point where I may have to be more direct and suggest that we cannot have play dates if her child continues to harm my child without consequence. In a period of two hours today he pushed her and threw two heavy items at her head. One hit her near her eye and she has a small bruise. The consequence he received was intentional ignoring and being forced to say sorry. My child is not allowed to put her hands on him, and is promptly given time out if she hits or throws (it never happens now). It has become part of the stories she tells people that her friend hits her, and I don’t want her to think it is acceptable to be hurt by a friend or to hurt someone without consequence.  My husband has expressed his concern about it as well (to me). I feel certain my friend would be upset if roles were reversed. 

I want to be able to support my friend, especially now that she is struggling, and continue our play dates, so I’m trying to think of a gentle way to let her know my concern has increased. Has anyone dealt with something similar or have a suggest for how to bring this up?"

amberalpine	2021-04-26 18:22:19+00:00	So apparently I'm completely out of touch with what my kid needs education wise.	"So my son turns three in a few weeks. We've been doing the early head start program (low income early childhood education) since September with them only figuring out how to adjust in the past three months. Every week we do a zoom meeting for parents and kids with a guest lecturer on a new parenting topic like discipline, diet, etc. This week's topic was about wellness checkups with the doctor... 

The guest speaker started listing all the reasons to the see a doctor for your kid and she mentions screening for developmental issues by checking to see if your kid can write their own name. I'm thinking, my son only learned to identify all the letters of the alphabet like three months ago, and he's able to recognize his name and others he's familiar with written out, but he certainly can't write his own name. We're still working on replicating circles, triangles, rectangular shapes and the difference between upper and lower case. I asked her about this and without a beat she was like, well you probably just aren't practicing enough you should go to the dollar tree and get some books. But I have like ten of these books and I regularly use them for arts/letters and numbers time to assist as learning materials, I just had the philosophy that even if he couldn't do them having him draw or do other parts of the activity books would make it easier to learn them later on. 

Anyway I'm here feeling like an utter failure. I read so many books, took so much time over the past year to try and make sure my kid had as many opportunities as possible, spend literally every minute of every day trying to make the days are educational and fun... But it wasn't enough and apparently my kid is behind enough for a child development professional to offhandedly diagnose him with a learning disability (she thinks dislexia?) because he is about to turn three and can't write letters or numbers."
katmio1	2021-04-26 18:13:37+00:00	PSA	"Just b/c mom and dad need time away from their kids for just one night or even a weekend doesn’t mean they are “bad parents”. We need to stop this stigma that says your life ends after having kids. While your priorities do absolutely change, by no means can you still not enjoy child-free time every now and again. In case you weren’t aware, it is actually healthy for both parents to have alone time together. 

Times have changed and it’s time to accept that."
No_Cryptographer6183	2021-04-26 17:25:47+00:00	How to raise a kid.	"Ok so for context I'm a psychology student in my 3rd year, also I'm very interested in development psychology.
I've watched a lot of videos on development psychology , read a lot of stuff on this topic on the internet and of course I've read a few books on this topic. Although I am not expert on this topic but here is what I learned so far.

Ok firstly  your kids will be affected by your life decisions, for example if you decide to get a college degree or start smoking or even exercising. These life decisions whether small or big will affect your children even if you still didn't have children.

Secondly when getting pregnant, it's a most that the pregnant mother should never be under stress EVER! ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS!  Because the first three months are very sensitive in the development of the fetus, also healthy food is very important like avocado or sweet potato.

Thirdly breastfeeding it's recommended exclusive breastfeeding (i.e. no other fluids or solids) for six months and then continued breastfeeding combined with solid foods for 2 years. NO POWDERED MILK always feed it the natural way, also avoid bottles, breastfeed it through the breast because it's very important  for the connection that needs to be built between the mother and the baby.
 
4th this is a mistake that parents  always do which is putting the infant in bed all day, you should always take you infant with you whether your going to the park or watching the tv or even when you're having guests, you don't know how important it is for the infant. They're learning stuff like face recognition or sound or color etc...

5th have another kid, never stop at one! Because having more children that aren't 2 years between, will help with the social development of the kid so much, it will also help with the competition between them.

6th develop your kid socially ESPECIALLY before the age of 5, as I said before have more than 2 kids, in my opinion 4 is the best number of having children.
Always try to surround your kid with other kids like having 2 kids, inviting others with their kids into your home like your siblings or neighbors, taking your kid to the park or playground letting them play with other kids, putting your kids in daycare etc... 

7th let your kid do stuff example if they know are at the age of knowing how to put their clothes let them do it, it might take longer than you putting their clothes for them but it's a lot better for their and self esteem &amp; independence.

8th teach your kid some skills before school for example like reading and writing, also teach them how to play the famous sport in your country, it will really help with their self esteem and will make them popular between their peers when they enter school.

9th be neglectful to some extent, DON'T BE OVERPROTECTIVE! Let your kid do stuff and experiment, let them fail in life, let rebel when they are teens, let them learn in life.  Being overprotective will make them naive, anxious, low self esteem, bullying target, dependant etc...

And there is a lot more but that what I know so far!"
Al_Eltz	2021-04-26 17:22:22+00:00	Autism Spectrum Signs?	"Our  daughter (20 mo) is the most amazing blessing we've had in our lives.  She is so incredibly easy, intelligent, and has a sense of humor that  bewilders us. But we've been worried lately.

First-time parent paranoia incoming:

She's  fine running on her feet, heels and all, but she is often tip-toeing  about. She will flap her arm as she's walking sometimes, and likes to  make a crab-like motion with her fingers without an obvious cue. She  will look you in the eyes sometimes, but she does seem to avoid eye  contact for too long. She is very talkative, but she also likes to  repeat some phrasing or words without a cue.

All these things  make us worry about her being on the spectrum, which my brother-in-law  happens to be. We know it won't affect our love for her even in the  slightest, we just worry about the challenges it poses for her life and want to help  make it easier on her as early as we can.

Additional  notes that help dispel our worries: She is more mentally advanced than  physically. She knows her ABCs and has since she was 19 mo. She could  count to ten at 18 mo, and is now counting to twenty. She has an  imagination that we can't understand how she comes up with (we are a  no-screen-time home). She is great at identifying what makes us laugh  and making her own little ""jokes."" She takes direction without flaw,  understanding exactly what is being asked. She is so well mannered I really can't complain. Heck, she can identify most of the birds at our bird feeder (""peck peck"" is the woodpecker, ""Black cheechee"" is the black-capped chickadee, ""Cow boo"" is the cow bird, etc.).

I could brag about  her all day, but I just want to point out that I feel that she is  progressing fine in most ways. We're just worried about the things I've noted above.  Anyone have any input or suggestions to dispel our concerns?"
hlamotte	2021-04-26 17:12:08+00:00	Reflux formulas and meds	"I have an almost 7 week old LO (3 weeks adjusted for preemie) and we are struggling with reflux.  Right now she is breastfed and we just started Pepcid but it seems to only really help at night when we give it and the medication is not approved to give more than once a day.  Even so, the medication is only a slight improvement but she is still having pain and discomfort.  I am thinking about moving to an anti reflux formula to see if that helps but not sure.  I don’t really love breastfeeding so I’m really only struggling with the guilt of switching, not an attachment to it.  Our pediatrician has also given Prevacid as an option if the Pepcid doesn’t work but it makes me nervous to start getting her onto a more serious medication.  

I’m wondering what other parent’s experiences are with switching from breastfeeding to an anti reflux formula have been and/or their experience with anti reflux meds like Prevacid.  Did it help your LO’s, if so how long did it take for you to see an improvement?  Did it not make any difference?  Any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated.  The mental torment of trying to make the correct decision is weighing on me heavily and I feel paralyzed by indecision."
Cranburson	2021-04-26 16:42:38+00:00	Our COVID Newborn Safety Measures	"Our LO was born in mid January, so just hit 3mo. As my wife and I (31 m/f) were combing through internet articles and talking with health care professionals about COVID-19 precautions, we felt there wasn’t really a list or set of directions for what types of precautions you should take. So, I wanted to share with you all what we put together for ourselves in case it is able to provide a frame for the precautions you all take with your (new) family. I recognize that everyone has a different level of risk mitigation they implement in their daily lives during the pandemic, and that different places in the world have varying levels of outbreak severity, so sharing to be helpful in what worked for us because it was really difficult to put pen to paper and actually figure out what we were comfortable with and how safe we wanted to keep the little one.

**Initial protocol set, effective 1/20 in our family:**

We invite the people in this email to join a ""bubble"" to help support us and Baby after birth. We understand these are rigorous asks, however we believe this is in the best interest of baby's safety, and mitigate COVID-19 risk to the greatest extent possible.

In order to enter the ""bubble"" we require a 14-day quarantine prior to entrance, and to meeting Baby. This means:

* Get a flu vaccine.
* Self-isolation with your immediate household - no household should have direct contact with anyone outside of your immediate household.
* Grocery and general shopping is limited to delivery or contactless pick-up (Fred Meyer has a great pick-up system where staff places items directly in your trunk).
* Work remotely.
* Outdoor exercise - maintain 20ft distance from others and wear a mask at all times. This means stay on wide roads where you can move to the other side of the street if you encounter someone else. Unfortunately this means forested areas and small paths where distancing is not attainable are prohibited.
* No golf, or other outdoor activity where you cannot ensure others rigidly respect a 20 ft distance.

Once the 14-day quarantine has been completed, those included in this email will be able to interact amongst each other and with us while continuing to abide by social distancing practices - we feel comfortable welcoming you into our house without a mask, and hope you will help us care for Baby. In order to ensure continued safety for baby, even in the bubble the following ground rules will be in effect:

* No one comes over who has possible symptoms, such as a cough, runny nose, fever, etc.
* Please wear fresh clothing when visiting (recently cleaned; not worn during previous activities)
* Visitors must wash hands before and after they visit.
* No one holds the baby without washing hands first.
* Please wear a mask while holding baby.
* No one kisses baby. Period.

**New protocols, shared 4/24**

As with before, we ask that you do not come over if you are feeling ill in any way (COVID symptoms or not) and that no one kisses the baby.

That being said: whether or not you join the bubble, as long as you are vaccinated you will be able to hold baby! What we ask for non-bubble members to hold him is:

* to be outside
* to double mask (surgical mask under cloth mask)
* clean hands (we will have hand sanitizer)
* clean clothes (not worn for any previous activities)
* and to be fully vaccinated (two weeks after your last shot).

For now, this will remain an option only for family members; we are not yet ready to have others outside the family hold him.

If you are interested in creating a bubble with us we ask you to go through a 7-day quarantine. What does a quarantine look like, you may ask. If you are fully vaccinated, quarantine consists of:

* Entering public locations with a mask on for 15 mins or less (quick food pick-ups or errands are fine, no long grocery store trips)
* necessary medical appointments are okay, please take appropriate precautions
* no indoor or outdoor dining at restaurants
* if you will be dining outdoors with other vaccinated people (at a home), sit at a separate table at least 6' apart - on that note, it's fine to enter someone's home (masked) to use the bathroom or wash hands
* social activities outside with other vaccinated people are fine
* when exercising/walking/etc outdoors always have a mask with you and put it on whenever passing others
* always maintain at least 6' distance and masks with unvaccinated people or people you don't know
* if someone needs to enter your home for an extended period of time (maintenance, house cleaning, etc.) we ask that you spend that time elsewhere.

After completing a quarantine, any bubble members can interact with other bubble members indoors without a mask for as long as everyone can continue to meet the quarantine expectations."
Silvermoon46	2021-04-26 16:33:58+00:00	Please help!! 22 month sleep regression	"Hi everyone, I’m trying to hire a sleep consultant but I really need advice in the meantime. I posted several times over the past 10 days but things are getting worse and worse and I am at a loss. 

My 22 month-old refuses to sleep. Plain and simple. Up until about week ago she was sleeping 12-13 hours a day (11h at night from 7:30pm-6:30am + 1.5h nap from 12:30pm to 2pm). She was amazing at putting herself to sleep and never woke up once at night over the past 12 months or so.

Suddenly something changed. First, huge battle to fall asleep at night and naptime. Because it was unusual at first, I offered comfort and also took her to the doctor to make sure everything was ok. She’s perfectly healthy. Also no obvious signs of teething.

Fast forward a week later, we have tried CIO, fading out, mattress on the floor, co-sleeping, she just won’t stay asleep. Every day is different but last night we did CIO and she fell asleep at 8pm after 30 minutes of crying. Then she woke up at 9 and 11pm (put herself back to sleep) and again at 1am at which point she screamed so hard that I went in to lay on her floor (my husband and I decided we would address one problem at a time so CIO for bedtime and then comfort at night until bedtime was better) and she just stayed awake until 6am. I kid you not. We stayed in the dark, no talking or singing, just some cuddles to help her doze but she would wake up every 10 minutes to scream mama and cry. Like she would fall asleep and suddenly stand back up and scream.

I think it’s related to separation anxiety and I worry that CIO is making things worse. However the softer methods don’t work either and I am exhausted after a whole week of 3-hour nights. I don’t know what to do or where to start. My husband thinks we should keep her up later but my gut tells me it will make thing worse. This is worse than the newborn stage and the sleep deprivation is making us all very unhappy. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated."

It’s like the 6th relapse and I’m just sick of it!!! I’ve always been a single mom, I left him before she was even 1 because of abuse.

A little over a year ago we had twin daughters but unfortunately we lost one shortly after she was born. Ever since then my wife has struggled with that and blames herself for not being a better mother (she’s a amazing mother and our daughter passing away wasn’t her fault). 

My daughter has some development issues since she was born early and she can’t say much beyond “up” “da” “buh”(her version of bye) and most importantly “mama”. Any time she’s scared, hurt, tired and wants cuddles she says mama. I’m not jealous at all. I’m very happy that even though my wife thinks she’s not a good mother our daughter knows otherwise. 

Side note: before I get people getting on to me for not making her feel like she’s a good mother, I’ve honestly tried. Watching your child die in your arms really makes you question how good of a parent you really are."

CountryPractical3370	2021-04-26 15:34:15+00:00	My parents are choosing a to be God parents than attend my graduation party.	"So I am first generation in my family to go to college. I was not born in the US so my first language isn't English. You can probably imagine how hard it's been to get to where I am.


I worked my a** off with two jobs at one point to be able to graduate. Many nights of crying and fighting the erge to quit. While my parents didn't help me in anything. What I mean by anything,  is that I paid for my car, gas, insurance, food, internet, school, and even helped out with my parents phone bill. So I was literally doing everything I possibly could to help my parents, while being a college student.


I transferred to a University two years ago. It's about 3 hrs away from my parents. Finally being a step closer to graduating and then the pandemic hit. So fast forward to now being my last semester,  the school finally said we were having a gradation. So I called my mom to let her know and decided on  the exact date for my graduation party. For the actual graduation ceremony is still being determined but its around May 20-22. Of course with restrictions on how many guest can attend, 3 per graduate.


The only 3 people that will attend my actual graduation is my fiancée, little sister, and my mother. Unfortunately, my dad can't come due to work not letting him get anymore days off. They have alot of work and he can't take any days off. 


Keep in mind I don't know the date of the graduation ceremony yet.


So yesterday my mother called me saying that an aunt ( dad's sister) who she doesn't really talk to, due to family issues. Is asking if my parents can be her daughter's God parents for her first communion.  My aunt said that she doesn't have anyone to be her daughters God parents because they need to be married. Her first communion date is May 22nd, which is going to be my graduation party. 


I am so upset because she asked me to change the date. Like if it doesn't mean anything to her. I can not do it the week after due to me going on vacation to celebrate my graduation. That is why we established the date of May 22nd. So that would mean me having to celebrate that I graduated in 4 weeks. Which doesn't have the same meaning anymore. 


In the moment i said yes, I would change the date because I felt horrible for the little girl. She doesn't have anyone to be her God parents. But why didn't my mom say no? Like why did she have to come tell me and make me feel bad to be forced to change the date. She knows how important this is to me and she knows about the trip I have planned. It is so upsetting, I have to compromise and make it around  them again. My aunt didn't even tell my mom she wanted her to be the God parents, It's so last minute.


So I called my mom back and told her I was still going to have the party that day. I explained that it's not the same anymore. Especially, if I do it in 4 weeks after I already graduated. I already invited my fiancée parents, and they made the time to make it May 22nd ( ps. All of us are vaccinated). So I would have to tell everyone never mind? 


She tells me she already called my aunt to say she could be the God mother. So this means she called her right after we hung up. It was like in the span of 10 mins. She did this so fast,  like she didn't even feel bad for canceling on me. So I told her I wasn't changing the date. I told my mom that I can always go over in 4 weeks to celebrate with them. Once I am back from my trip. 


Now I feel like the bad person for not changing the date. What should I do? I feel like I am being so dramatic or even overreacting? It hurts that I won't have my parents there to celebrate with me. It also hurts that they put other people's needs before there own daughters. Keep in mind that my mother also doesn't know if she will be able to come to my actual graduation if it lands on May 22nd.

The point is that I shouldn't have to explain why it's important. They should know that it's something you just don't  miss. 


I sent a group chat to my other siblings letting them know I will still be having the party. The only thing one sibling said was that my mom was going to feel bad. NO THOUGH ON HOW I WAS FEELING. 


I honestly don't even know why I expected so much from my parents. I was expecting them to be different this time. Anyways, what are your thoughts? Am I in the wrong?"

I mean she always had been on it but since it’s her junior year of HS I’m more conscious that it’ll intervene with her studies. I can tell she’s on a group chat talking with her friends which I normally condone but they talk constantly and nonstop. Many times I yelled at her and she apologize, the constantly texting stops for a few days and it starts again and then begin the cycle. It’s like my opinion doesn’t matter at all and she’s clearly more interested in spending time joking around with her friends instead of studying or quality family time. I want to give her a more severe punishment instead of just yelling. What can I do?"
muhibimran	2021-04-26 15:05:30+00:00	Need advice for my child	"We had been living in joint family. When my son was 3, he used to say bad words repeatedly. He just heard once from someone saying and then keeps it on loop so often. The more we tried to stop him, the more he enjoys saying them again and again.

Later I got job in another country and took my family with me. We lived here for 2 years and he got absolutely fine. Possibly because it was new environment for him and less people around him to annoy. I was very glad that he got rid of all his bad habits.

I left my job recently and my wife and kid went back to the home country last week and I will also be going back next week. My wife told me he started saying all those bad words he forgot 2 years ago. Most probably he got same environment and same people again around him which refreshed his memory.

Me and my wife are so much upset again because of him. It took us a lot of time to get him on track and now he is back to same position.

I am going back next week and considering to hit him now (though I never hit him before). He is 5 now and all the hardwork we did on him seems went into drain. I am looking for serious advice because I have literally lost my patience now.

Ps: sorry for my bad English"
ihave2evilspawns	2021-04-26 15:03:39+00:00	Up coming birthday	"So my middle child's birthday I coming up in June last year we were on the height of the pandemic so we had socially distance outside event with about 15 family members all who had graciously agreed to be tested before hand. I normally throw a BIG party when the first year they start school invite the whole class we couldn't do that last so I had planned on doing it thus the whole family extend included are fully vaccinated so I am not so concerned about the number of people plus we always have her party outside big backyard plenty of space to stay socially distance and we incoirage everyone to wear a mask if they like. The only problem is may marks the first time since this stupid pandemic that people in my country really are able to go outside and do things. The week we have her party is the same week that her favorite relatives from her half sister's family (dad hasn't been apart of her life in years but father of my youngest child took her like she was always part of theirs) will not be able to attend. I worry that a lot of her friends from school will also not make it because of the fact it is the first official weekend of summer vacation for our school district. I don't know what to do. We only have two other open weekends on being the memorial holiday weekend and the other being the weekend after her birthday. I worry that no matter which weekend of the 3 I puck to have it not alone of friends and family will be able to make it. Everyone has assured me they would send gifts which is great but I don't have parties so they can get gift. Don't get me wrong the gifts are always so wonderful and appreciated. The memories that they will have are what I try to make the most important sharing their special day with the people they feel are special to them. She has had some pretty bad luck over the years with parties from rain outs to getting poison and even spending two days in the hospital for one of them. I was hoping to finally have the one she's been hoping for. What do I do?

Daughters birthday is at a bad time for having friends and family available to attend. Worried it will not be what she had hoped for after a years of unfortunately bad luck with parties? Wondering if I should change the date to another date and hope more can show up or let it go and hope for the best but chance disappointing her because 3 of her favorite family members won't be able to make it?"

He’s slept through the night since he was a month old (I’m lucky I know) and was recently moved to his crib in his nursery. He is now waking up every 30 minutes or so and needs to be rocked back to sleep and this cycle repeats all night long. I know there is nothing i can do but ride this out but I’m so exhausted.. His dad isn’t in the picture so I have no one to “trade shifts” with. I’m hoping to get some sleep soon and more than anything I hope this doesn’t last long. Sigh
steelprimedabbleyoo	2021-04-26 14:38:04+00:00	About the friendly insults:	"From a teen to adults, we get that hearing us insulting our friends on the phone might make you think ""he is disrespecting his friends, through the phone no less, he will end up without friends at that rate"", but our insults are ironic and also considered a proof of intelligence, since getting our insult game up requires insults to be thunk through. So, next time you hear your teen saying ""you're like a raw potato, ugly, dirty and with no taste at all"", it is a competition, not a direspectful statement. Seriously, my mother hears what i call my friends and must think ""how does he still have friends? I would've ended up alone tell someone this back in '93!"". Well, it's because we laugh of each other and of ourselves which makes us stronger and less hurt by intimadators. Do as you may with that info, i am merely putting it put there. Just don't @ me for saying that.

Also, now i see the issue with my last post, brought forth by your replies was my realisation. I'm an autistic 14y/o guy in case you didn't know."
Paulinimelissa	2021-04-26 14:35:57+00:00	Feeling of failure... young adult kids not thriving. Why are they so ungrateful?	"I’ve been thinking about posting my story for years. I need to know if anyone can relate... or provide insight!

I worked hard to give my kids everything I felt they needed: as a single mom (dad saw them every second weekend unless THE kids opted NOT to visit), I attended all sporting and school events solo while holding down a full-time job/advancing my career, I single-handedly ensured their post-secondary education was fully paid for in advance so they wouldn’t have to collect debt, I took them to and paid for doctors’ and dentists’ appointments, helped them with homework, got them braces, attended parent/teacher meetings solo, travelled with them and enjoyed many MANY parks/zoos/road trips, connected them with physiological help for more difficult situations that I wasn’t able to help with, helped with their first resumes, job interviews,  and income tax reports, taught them about work ethic, how to cook, do laundry, play board games, etc. I encouraged them to live life to its fullest and do whatever made them happy — I made them my first priority... always.

My family disowned me after the divorce, so I pretty much did it all on my own; I thrived at being both a great mom and career woman. Or so I thought... neither child is living their best life and I feel I have failed them both: they both only have high-school diplomas despite once dreaming of higher education, both struggle with anxiety and depression (which I never had), one (F/22) has never dated and the other (M/20) had a two-year unhealthy relationship and hasn’t dated since. One still lives at home gaming all night, while the other moved out just prior to the pandemic (to be closer to their dad who only did the bare minimum as a parent for two decades!).

Both children have expressed recently that I wasn’t there for them emotionally and saw the above actions as “only caring about money”. I explained to them that, as a single-mom, I had to ensure I had an income to provide for them. And that the money allowed for special experiences like travelling to other countries; it also paid for their teeth, medication, and education.

Did I try too hard? Do too little? Are they failing because of the divorce from their dad? Was my second marriage a trigger to their young adulthood’s downward spiral?

Since they are now adults, should I assume it’s out of my hands? Should I assume there’s nothing more for me to do other than listen, celebrate successes, and remind them of how much I love them? Do I need to push the last one out of the home to fly on his own?

How did I raise such ungrateful kids? Did my own resilience backfire on me? Should I have shown them more of my own fears, sadness, and anger? Did the disconnect with my own family and lack of family gatherings have an impact on how they view me and how they build or avoid building their own relationships?

More Background:
F/46 here, met my first husband/my kids’ dad at 16 (he was 22 and introduced to me by mutual friends), engaged at 19, married at 20.

Had my first child (F) at 23, second (M) at 25 — I requested a divorce at 28 (kids were 2 and 4). I had never been madly in love with the dad, but marriage and kids were the “next thing to do” in my family after the long-term relationship. I was too naive/weak to exit the relationship. In hindsight, I should’ve ended it by age 18. He wasn’t the guy for me... I didn’t know who was, but I knew this guy lacked culture, ambition, assertiveness, and personality.

I raised our kids solo for 9 years while building my career. I only had one serious boyfriend during that time, whom I married and moved in with after a 6-year relationship —  I HAVE been VERY happily married ever since (THIS is what love and a relationship should be!). I did not want or have more kids, and my husband never wanted kids of his own, so it’s just us and my children.

Both children have shown anger over the years when my husband gives me a gift. Neither child has ever celebrated me on my birthday or Mother’s Day despite me helping them to celebrate others."

She was pretty bummed this morning. So we got it out of the car, dropped it in a ziplock and smashed for a few minutes. She now has a [bag of candy](https://imgur.com/a/59rtbZ4) and I wait for the next crisis.

(No you can't open it yet, we have to wait, we'll open them in the car if you are good listeners, stop touching each other or I take the lollipops away, no you can't take it to bed with you, why is it in the freezer , no you can't take it on the trampoline...)"
impossible-savings64	2021-04-26 14:29:06+00:00	pre k mask requirement	My son is 4 and will be entering pre k. We were set on a school but learned that there is no mask required. I was surprised and learned it’s not required for day cares but is if the day care is tied to elementary school. This is in nj. Wondering if this is normal practice and how others feel about not masking in doors. All other schools required masks in doors and it was split between schools on optional mask requirement outdoors.

I'm self employed but for some reason people think that means I'm just available whenever and have an easy job and just get paid well.. lucky me.  


I have a baby (20 months) and a Kindergartener and 1st grader. I'm in NYC so you walk everywhere or go by bus. It's hell to try to park here.   


I am SLAMMED.. and have been stuck inside homeschooling my kids for over a year due to NYC schools not reopening like normal. Let me tell you.. it is BRUTALLY hard to teach small kids from scratch and you're spelling out every single word, letter by letter and the assignments never stop.. I try to cram in their academics when the baby naps but can hardly keep up. Everything piles up.  


I am cleaning nonstop.. cooking nonstop.. hearing ""mommy' nonstop.. the screaminig (NONSTOP).. crying.. whining.. tantrums..and the fact I don't get to shower for DAYS and that my self employed income is literally maybe 1/3 of what it could be.. are really getting to me. My husband works hard and is gone 6-7 days a week.. 60-70 hours a week.. I know he isn't out partying but I envy him a lot because he SEES his hard work in a paycheck and his day ends.. even as stressful as his job is he still gets a lunch and adult convo.. uninterrupted..  


The stress has been so severe and so chronic that it has caused me to have a hormonal imbalance, adult acne, insomnia.. and NOW.. as of this week.. I am breaking out all of a sudden in stress rashes on my chest and neck.. Never had this in my life until kids.. I've also gained 100 pounds (obviously that's on me as well) so I'm not feeling too hot about getting back into the job market. I know my self employed projects would take off but I Just need a good 4-5 months to double my income.   


The problem? Nannies in NYC want literally $25/hr.. I get it.. it's expensive here.. but this doesn't even include cleaning/cooking.. possibly would include them doing homework with the kids. That would actually wipe out the income I'm making now and I'd still have quite a bit to do when I got home. I'd also have to rent an office or coworking space since my baby knows when I'm home and won't stop screaming and crying outside of the bedroom while I try to work. The nearest office looks to be 40 mins away via bus.,,quickest and best option bc parking is a no go here and terribly expensive.. it also doesn't save tons of time driving..  


I feel guilty as it seems many women wish they could stay home (or do they??).. and I hate to sound ridiculous because most days I'm almost in tears.. feel like I've TOTALLY lost myself as a human being and feel very depressed when I should feel lucky... and wonder if I take the jump to work if I'll regret not seeing my kids at all.   


I have 3 kids so childcare is going to be no joke. Easily over $4,000 a month at a daycare so might as well hire a Nanny and it will be the same. Don't even get me started on how anxious I am leaving my kids with strangers.. and all the horror stories.. I think that's why I've allowed myself to be miserable for so long.  


When my husband has a day off and I get to go out, I feel GREAT.. like ME.. No depression.. it's a huge sigh of relief.   


Has anyone been in this dilemma? How did you handle it? Especially if you weren't sure you could ""afford"" to go back to work, if that makes sense.   


I keep torturing myself about all the logistics and how much money I'll be spending to basically pay someone else to be with my kids and that I'll still be stressed coming home because I'll be responsible for cleaning and cooking likely so my day won't just end. But I know now I walk around with a clenched jaw.. yelling at them.. losing my temper.. (they're VERY spirited kids and I didn't get one SUPER easy kid.. of course) and that I feel like I'm wasting my life away.. I've been doing this 7+ years.. I NEVER WANTED TO BE A STAY AT HOME MOM.. Literally ever.. It has just worked out this way because I am self employed and juggling this was helping us survive at one point.  


Any ideas? Any feedback from anyone who was in my shoes? My desperation just feels like at an absolute max but I'm very type A and stressed thinking about the details""  


1) How will I know they're safe? The baby can't even talk yet..   
2) What is the nanny is a bad person who abuses them? (I will never be able to live with myself after that)  
3) How can I afford this/nanny and to rent an office space to go work?  
4) What if I decide I don't necessarily want to be gone 5 days a week after all and miss them?  
5) Is it really worth paying $4,500 a month to get childcare/an office and commute 1.5 hours a day to go work somewhere? I'm essentially get 6.5 hours a day to work. 

6) My husband will support me in this.. huge step as he's from a Latin family and you just don't leave kids with anyone but abuelitos..but we went to marriage counseling and saw.. free childcare with his family wasn't ""free"".. they're not bad people but the stress it caused in our family just wasn't worth it.. I'm worried if this nanny/me working thing doesn't work he'll never trust to make those decisions again and go back to ""Only family can watch kids""  


  
I think I need to get the hell out of my own way.. In fact, deep down somewhere I know this. For some reason.. I have developed even WORSE Anxiety and sort of paranoia .. moreso during this pandemic than I had before.. Like I'm a worry wart but now it's like I can't stop going over in my head about the nanny hurting my kids or kidnapping them.. etc. Looking up statistics I see this is like a what.. 1 in 10,000 chance?? IDK but it's not super high.. especially if you actually vet your nanny and they have reviews but for some reason I am wound so tight and always panicked that danger is imminent...   
I also ACHE knowing I am going to possibly spend over $4,000 a month when my income NOW is that.. but I know if I work 10 hours a week now and hiring someone would allow me to work literally almost 3x more that I could definitely double my income within 4-5 months.. I guess I'm just nervous because I'm going to be in deficit at first..   


Then sometimes I'm thinking I've become such a mean mommy and this is no good for my kids..and I should even just go to work JUST to pay a nanny and even break even to save my sanity for now..   


Would appreciate any feedback.. I know it seems stupid that I'm struggling with leaving my kids with someone else and I even feel selfish for doing this after having raised them for so long."
justcatfinated	2021-04-26 13:59:59+00:00	"Large child, large diapers"	"So recently we had to switch our 14mo up to the next size of Pull-Ups. He’s now in 4T-5T and they fit him perfectly. He’s 99% in every aspect and has been steady with the measurements at each visit. 

He’s not a fat boy, he’s just overall freaking HUGE. Anyone else have/had a very large tot and what did you do about diapers when they got too big for what you could find? 

I want to try to potty train him soon, but he’s not showing interest yet so I’m not pressed to force him since I don’t think his bladder is anywhere near ready. But it’s coming fast. I know Walmart sells size 7 (which should be comparable to the next size up) but I don’t know if they’re similar enough in sizing to Huggies pull-ups.. which I had to put him in because tryign to wrestle this child into a standard diaper is hell, and being a pregnant balloon it makes it so much harder to do. 


I’m just... in awe of how big this kid is. Almost 3’ tall and just shy of 31lbs. To think last year he was in the NICU fighting a brain bleed to this monster sized bright little man blows my mind."
leondemedicis	2021-04-26 13:58:46+00:00	Super energetic 2years old! Looking for Ideas of activities to wear her out	"Hello


As the title says, my daughter just turned 2 and she is crazy about running. Since the pandemic I have been working from home and she was staying with me (no daycare) and have our routine which included daily jumping in the stroller and going for a jogg before heading to the park. So she associates park, stroller, and me wearing pants (pandemic edition) to running. Also we leave in a loft with a view on a trail and she sees people run on a daily base. 

In the past 3 months, she started just running in circles around the table kitchen island with all the time (until she is winded and starts sweating). When we go to the park, she will run from the condo to the park (0.6miles )
And back. At the park she will do a bit of the swing then ask to run with the ball (soccer)... 

This is great! She sleeps 12h after that but I feel like I should provide a better setting than running around the kitchen table or on a trail where I spend my time making sure she does not get hit by bycicles or other runners. 

Now that my household is fully vaccinated, I was wondering if other parents worh 2 years old had found some athletic activities for very active kids


Thanks"

Insertfake_namehere	2021-04-26 13:54:25+00:00	Are my parents right for assualting me for assualting my sister?	"Ok. The title is a tad bit misleading and clickbait-y but it still has relevance.   


On Monday April 19th 2021, I ( a scrawny, 5""6 ,120 lbs., 15 y/o male) was doing the dishes. During this time my (6 y/o, 3""6? (I don't know her weight but she is not scrawny)  sister was minding her own business.  While I was doing the dishes, I decided it would be fun to mess with her. So every so often I would stop doing the dishes and poke her with my finger or tickle her a little bit. She showed signs of not liking me doing that but I did not stop. Eventually, I found a broken rubber band and decided it would be fun to hit her with it. Keep in mind, this was no regular sized rubber band. It was one of those small ones you would put together to make a bracelet or tie hair with.  Well, after I hit her with it, she started crying and looked to my step dad. He was very upset she was crying. He came to her to ask her what I did to her. She didn't respond because she was crying. I then chimed in to tell my stepdad I hit her with a rubber band, I then proceeded to hold up the small rubber band I hit her with. Now, I'm not sure what was going through his mind at the time but, he then grabbed a broom and hit me over the head with it. Not wanting to get hit again I grabbed the broom from him. As soon as I grabbed the broom from him he attacked me. He held me up by my head and hit me against a chandelier (My mom complaining about how we broke it the next day), screamed at me about how he wanted me out his house, slam my head into the floor, and hit me in my side. After our confrontation, I locked myself in the bathroom cause I was too upset / scared to come out.  


Fast forward a few days later. Apparently, I'm acting depressed and my mother is concerned because I'm not doing my chores anymore (she knew what happened). She eventually had enough of me not doing chores and she made us all have a discussion about it.  I presented my side of the whole (the story you read) and my stepdad presented his side (He saw me bothering my sister and ""taking away her peace"" so he decided to do what he did so I would stop bothering her). I told my parents how it wasn't fair that because I hit my sister with a rubber band I got assaulted by a 40 y/o man that worked out. My parents then twisted it by saying, ""It wasn't fair to my sister that I assualted her with a rubber band."" They also then brought up me and my sister's history of play fighting. Admittedly, we often play fighted. My parents then tried to spin it AGAIN saying that I assualt my sister when we play fight and hit her as hard as I would hit another 15 y/o. This is obviously not true, I may be scrawny but I am not THAT scrawny. After that they said basically said I deserved it for hitting my sister and that it was MY fault for assualting my sister and giving my stepdad a need to feel like he needs to defend her.   


That brings me here. Reddit, were my parents right in their actions?

Some additional detail that would be important but I couldnt fit into the story:   
\-When I play fight with my sister I often use ridiculous fighting moves like: Using two fingers to hit her with or I would focus more on evading and using her weight against her to make her fall.  
\-She is often the instigator, hitting me to get a response out of me.  
\- I have multiple bruises and scares on my body from her while she has none.

\-I am very pacifistic and often do not engage in physical altercations unless needed to.

\- In the moment my stepdad was attacking me I wanted to kill him. I was to far away from our knife drawer to do any real damage

\- I broke a broom trying to defend myself from him

CavalierFishmonger	2021-04-26 13:43:46+00:00	My 4yo is licking himself and other stuff because he thinks it kills germs.	"Recently, my 4yo has begun licking himself. I will look over and he is seemingly absent mindedly running his tongue up and down his forearm or sticking his hand in his mouth and licking it all over. I’ve even caught him licking his leg and his foot. Then the other day I heard him gagging in his room. When I rushed in to see what was the matter I found out he had picked the area rug on his floor. He didn’t want to tell me at first because he was afraid I’d get mad. 

At first I thought maybe this was some sort of sensory input behavior? He isn’t diagnosed with anything but he can seem hyper active at time and I do think he might have an anxiety issue because he worries about a lot of things. We even got a referral from the pediatrician to get him evaluated but we just haven’t gone yet. 

However, he finally explained that he licks because there are germs on him. Not surprisingly given the pandemic, he has developed a serious concern with germs. He learned on Story Bots that we have immune systems with white blood cells that kill germs. So now whenever he is concerned there are germs on him - which is often - he licks himself so that the germs will get into his body where his white blood cells can kill them. He tells me this a lot now. 

Is this outside the realm of “normal” weird kid behavior? We’ve had him out of daycare since the pandemic began, so I don’t feel like I have a good baseline for normal weird kid stuff and worrying weird kid stuff. I also think I might have made it worse both by reinforcing worries about germs and by calling too much attention the the licking when it started. I am trying to just ignore it today, but it worries me. 

Thoughts? I am going to call today to make an appointment with the child therapist for that evaluation but where we live we might have to wait a bit for an appointment."
Doct0rAcula	2021-04-26 13:38:22+00:00	"Single Dad with full custody, is it wrong for my 4 year old daughter to sleep in my bed?"	"I won't go into too many details since its a very crazy story (you can check my post history for details) but long story short I have full custody of my daughter as a single Dad. Some nights she gets scared or lonely and sneaks into my bed. I don't exactly fight it right now because 1- I'm all alone and already exhausted. I can't exactly sacrifice hours of sleep per night fighting with her to stay in her room, and 2- I really don't mind at all, and she has severe separation anxiety from me that she is in play therapy for due to what her mother did. 

I am still close with my ex in-laws and they help me out one day per week, but they (and my daughter's mother who came back into the picture but still doesn't have custody) thinks its very inappropriate for an almost 4 year old girl to sleep in bed with her Dad. My theory on the subject is that I'm all she has right now. Obviously if her mother was still around it would be all of us. I legitimately would like other opinions to see if I am in fact in the wrong or not. Being all alone with her and fully responsible for every aspect of her life I sometimes second guess everything I do and could use some advice. 

To try to end it, I made her room exactly how she wanted it. It ended with a princess canopy that she LOVED but I was forced to take it down due to their worries that she would get tangled up in it at night and she hasn't stayed a full night in there since. I'm just lost right now, and open to criticism."

My daughter is 5 in July, shes always been a very strong willed kid, and she is absolutely beautiful when she wants to be, but it seems over the last year or so her tantrums and overall attitude have just gotten too much and I blame myself and I cry qnd I feel guilty because I feel like I'm always arguing with her or she's always in trouble and its very exhausting.
We have a 6 month old son, and since he's been here she has gotten worse, she adores her brother but to me and she's awful.
She's just started school, and now she has started saying she hates me or doesn't love me when she's mad and doesn't get her way about something, and this breaks my heart.
She ignores me, she will tell me no, then she will scream and kick and cry and throw things when I say no to something as simple as tv or a snack. 
Its a never ending battle 😭 I've tried the naughty corner, time out in her room, taking toys, taking pocket money, no TV time etc etc and it only works for about 5 minutes and she's back being naughty again or doing what she was just told off for doing... 
Any advice? What do I do, I just want to not be cranky all the time because it's exhausting. I really do love her buy man is her attitude disgusting for a 5 year old.
It is help that im always giving empty threats like ""if you do that again you'll lose tv time etc "" but then I give in because im just tired of her screaming at me and need the baby to sleep too. 
I need some advice and help on how to handle it better because I feel so guilty for always being grumpy at her, I love her and want her to be able to regulate her emotions and feel like we are here for her but I just don't know how or what to do

Sorry if that's confusing."

Illustrious-Music-61	2021-04-26 12:18:17+00:00	It it fair to give only one of my twins a car?	"Last month was my twins sons 16th birthday and while they are the same age, their behavior could not be more different. One is responsible, likes studying, helping out at home and is very organized, while the other is really rebellious and even got caught drinking recently. I can easily afford a car for both of them, however giving the history of behavior with the last one, I don't think he has the maturity to own a car for his and other safety. Because of my work I can't drive than to High School and where I live they take more than twice the time using public transportation than if they had a car.

The more studious twin asked for one as it would really give him more time for working on his projects cutting the commute time and would not object driving his brother to places he needed (while also not driving him places he shouldn't go)

So is it fair to give only of my twins a car? It seems it could escalated. 
But is it fair to deny him a car only because he brother can't have one? That seems like punishing him for somethings he has no fault on."

We haven't ever spanked our daughter before. We gentle parent and are against corporal punishment. So naturally I was already mortified to think she had been smacked, let alone to this degree. It instantly came up in a huge welt! He hit her HARD. No doubt it will bruise it has left a red mark.. I was crying along with my daughter and told my husband to leave and that we didn't want to be around him.

He smacked her because she apparently had our small dog in a choke hold hugging him and wouldn't let go. (She wouldn't of meant to hurt him she adores animals) he said he didn't mean to smack her as hard as he did and expressed remorse and guilt.

kitherarin	2021-04-26 09:09:08+00:00	Think I screwed up my kid’s party	"It’s my kid’s 7th birthday this week and so since my country is relatively COVID free (Australia), we organised his birthday party at the local ice skating rink. Booking couldn’t be made until the 9th of May. Decided we couldn’t help it so made the booking. 

Printed out the invitations and popped them in his school bag to give to his friends. My best friend asks me later that day if we realised we’d booked his party on the same day as Mother’s Day. 

Crap. No.

That would explain why we’ve had only one person rsvp their coming (we invited 9 as that was the minimum number you could have for their party deal).

It’s no big deal in that 7 year old is still super excited about his one friend coming. I just feel somewhat like an idiot. We just don’t do much for Mother’s Day so it really hadn’t registered in my brain as having the same date as the kid’s party."

"My 13yr old daughter recently tried to make an attempt, after a bout of depression that came out of nowhere. She was on a new medication for a chronic condition, but we weren't told a possible side effect was mood changes. Then out of nowhere she developed depression but didn't tell us even though she was acting odd and we were asking her what was up. This is even more odd considering she tells us everything.

Fast forward, it's been a few weeks and she's out of the hospital. She's seen a psychiatrist and she's now on prozac and we've set her up to see a therapist as well. I have got her on a schedule and got her active going for walks with me, and her sleep is now also on a good schedule.

My issue now is that I can't rest. I'm so worried about her. I look around the home and stress about everything. I've bought a safe, locked everything up, and try to be there for her in any way she needs me to be. I take her for walks, play games with her, talk to her, anything. I got like a 45min nap and now I'm going into a night shift after basically zero sleep. Is this my life now? I mean, I will do anything I need to that will help her, but when can I trust her again? How long did it take you to trust your kids after such an event? I fear I won't be able to do anything anymore because of my anxiety over this, and I'm also a mature student.

I don't know if I should be protecting him or if this is just how babies learn to get around. 

He started crawling a month ago and likes to be on the move 24/7. He's getting more coordinated every day but, usually when he's moving from sitting to standing or crawling to sitting, he often loses his balance and hits his head. Not like DIRECTLY from standing to the floor but from crouching to the floor usually. It doesn't help that we have hardwood floors :( there's a play area for him where the floor is covered in a foam mat, but since it's enclosed and not terribly big, I can't keep him in there all day. 

Sometimes I'm right there with him when he bonks but can't react fast enough, other times I'll be cleaning the floors or whatever while he explores. I feel like a piece of shit every time. None have been bad enough that he cries longer than a minute or so but still... is this normal? Should I be doing something different?"
whitedude1115	2021-04-26 04:59:02+00:00	Our daughter (14 months) is currently going through a sleep regression. Any advice?	"We’ve have the same bedtime routine since she was about 6 months old and we’re not sure of the cause of the sudden change. Starting last week, if we would put her down in her crib while she was awake she would perk up and start screaming. We thought it was odd but we let it go for a few minutes. She didn’t stop for 10 minutes. 
When she is asleep when we put her in her crib, she wake up about 4 hours later screaming. She doesn’t stop until we’ve held her for a few minutes. 
Now she’s screaming like that when trying to get her back to sleep at midnight. Not sure where we go from here and I’m hoping I can get some advice."

BuFFmtnMama	2021-04-26 04:28:05+00:00	Are my expectations of my 9M way too high?	"My oldest will be 10 in three months. He is such a space cadet. He is young for his grade so that may contribute to him being overwhelmed and just kind of flittering through the day. But mostly he just cannot do anything on his own or even after several reminders. He will also occasionally respond that he did something when really he did not. I cannot tell if he just lies on purpose because he does not care or if he is so spaced out or anxious he just responds affirmatively because that is the easiest. We have tried alarms on his fitbit to remind him of things then he says they did not go off (lie). I have bright green tape inside his backpack to remind him to bring his planner home. I tell him everything 3 or more times before it gets done...and these are routine things he should be used to doing (hang up your bath towel, pack your snack, grab your backpack on the way out the door 🤦🏻‍♀️)

So I am just getting really worried he is going to be some really unproductive adult. He is not artistic, creative or athletic. He really is just kind of lazy and disorganized about everything, but also is fairly smart. I really don’t care what he does as a profession, but would like him to be able to hold a job. 

I have started being really hard on him about all this to the point where I wonder if I am causing him emotional damage...by telling him if he does not get more organized and work harder he will have a hard time being a successful adult. This seems harsh to say and I wonder if this is all more about my own type A slightly neurotic personality."
ihop4music	2021-04-26 04:24:25+00:00	How do I help my daughter navigate a new dynamic?	"Okay, so this situation is already done, but I was reflecting on this scenario while it was happening and since.

A little background:

I have a 6 yo daughter who has not been told no consistently for much of her life. A variety of reasons at play here. She is the first grandchild on one side of the family, and the first grandchild stateside on the other. Two very loving sides to her. One side is full of educators (mine) who seemingly will play nearly anything with her - whatever her imagination comes up with. That’s our love language, and I think it’s an okay thing to say yes when she asks to play something. We do not let her play meanly or cheat, so “no” is said when necessary.

The other side of the family’s love language is gift giving. They are all more well-off financially and are huge gift givers. This is also the side of the family where she’s the first grandchild. She gets shown love most that way at that house. Two totally different, but completely fine, dynamics. 

Now I’ll bring myself and her father into play. We are heading to divorce due to infidelity on his part multiple times throughout the marriage. I am a full time teacher, and for the last two years, was also a full time grad student. As you might discern from my soon to be ex’s behavior, I often didn’t see him in the evenings or on weekends - “working late” or “playing ball.” Some of those were probably legit. Either way, for too many years, I took on the brunt of the child rearing while having two other full time things going on. As we all do, I often just gave in to my daughter because it was easier and I was overwhelmed. Dad wasn’t around enough to really witness any of her defiant behavior (normal kid stuff) towards me. 

Now to where we are now. I have stepped away from the marriage, and have moved to a new house with my daughter. Since making this step, I’m trying to be more mindful as a mother and the choices I make and words I say. 

In our new house, we are half of a duplex in a suburban neighborhood. Our old house was in the middle of downtown in our area and not really Conducive to just hanging out in the yard or something to play. 

A little girl lives on the other side of our duplex, but she is 3 years older than my daughter. They have some fun, and my daughter - manifesting some behaviors and anxieties of mine - is somewhat obsessed with playing with her new BFF and gets pretty sad when it can’t happen, or mad when I say it’s time to come inside. I know the other little girl really likes Lily, but also from casual talk with her, I know that the age gap will sometimes come into play and the neighbors interest in playing with her every single night. They’re just two very different developmental ages. But, they do have fun for the handful of hours over the stretch of the week. 

Today was the neighbors birthday, and last night she had an 11 year old friend of hers over for a sleepover. My daughter kept saying, “I wish we could play,” and I could tell from happenings around the house, that their entire household was prepping for the sleepover and party (which they had today). Once the friend came over, we spotted them on her trampoline. My daughter wanted to go outside on the porch to watch (this is behavior she’s learned from me...kind of torturing myself with something that I can’t have or shouldn’t have). The neighbor did ultimately spot us, and asked My daughter if she wanted to jump. I immediately stepped in saying we were about to cook dinner and have our weekly Zoom call (my family has Zoomed from across the country every week since the pandemic started). I told my daughter she could jump if she wanted to, but really only for a few minutes. The caveat was that if she wanted to do that, she had to go outside and ask if she could jump with them for a short time. She got very shy and even cried about being too nervous and ultimately decided not to. 

Knowing my daughter, and her slight obsession with this new living situation, I was pretty sure she would end up with hurt feelings (completely unintentional), especially because both of the other girls were a good deal older than her. Add to that my daughter is quite short for her age, and the 11 yo seemed quite tall for hers.  

In my head, I felt it was something she needed to learn about - not always being the “chosen one” to play and recognizing that friends have other relationships different from her own. I didn’t think it would be appropriate to work her into the neighbor’s party.  

I know her obsessions and compulsions are because of the dynamic she’s grown up with here, but I can’t stop thinking about this.  Am I crazy? Did I do her wrong? Something about the idea of her being invited just because we happened to be spotted didn’t sit well with me. I wanted to be able to talk to her about it, rather than her feeling crushed trying to navigate it so young. 

Anything y’all would suggest for the future?"
no1tamesme	2021-04-26 04:06:10+00:00	Where do you go after an autism diagnosis?	"So, I don't want to get too into the details about my son (9yo, just diagnosed last month) as I'm kind of hoping other people can use this information themselves.  When I searched previous posts I didn't really find the information I was hoping for.  Obviously, I have no problem giving out more information if someone things it can help or if they could offer more insight as the ""professionals"" we have talked to thus far have been more on the ""wait and see"" or ""well, his grades are good"" approach, which is what has led to my son not being diagnosed until 9 in the first place.

As a parent, where do you go after the ""official"" diagnosis?  My son was diagnosed thru school- sort of, they had an outside psychologist come in and do the evaluation and stuff.  But, because his behavior is relatively great at school, the services they offered were very slim (basically none) and the psychologist actually only really recommended equine therapy- which I have looked into, unfortunately, I was unable to find any within an hour of our location.  So, I'm left sort of blank with it all.  

I've been reading so much and I'm confused.  Medical assistance- check, we did get that for him.  But what now?  There's so many options and it's freaking confusing!  

Do I find a sort of all inclusive center and have him reevaluated in order to figure this out?  Do they have those?  ABA therapy, play therapy, behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, social skills.  I know some of my son's struggles thru living with him, watching him interact, etc. but I don't know what would help him the best or where to go about finding that information out.  

Thanks."
TedWong_Hynan	2021-04-26 03:46:09+00:00	My son won’t latch to mummy breast!	"Hello I recently became a Dad about a week ago and I’m still trying to steady the ship with my wife. For the first few days because my wife milk production wasn’t that high, we mix abit of formula to help satiate the baby. Then she has this painful wrist also that makes her hard to breast feed. So we been pumping consistently to get the milk production up but most of the milk went into a bottle to feed the baby. Now my wife wants to try to get baby to Latch he just goes into a rage crying when we try to get him to latch. Both sides. We were wondering maybe he is use to the quick outflow of milk from the bottle compare to the breast which takes time.  My wife is feeling stress about it and I was hoping I can have some guidance on how to get the baby to slowing ease into Mama breast and start latching comfortably."
Joey9999	2021-04-26 03:45:58+00:00	10 year old &amp; friends	"I either need some direction or I need to be reassured, I'll let you decide :)   I have a 10 year old son who, if you met him, would not seem like there would be any reason to worry.  He's smart, he's funny, he's kind, he's sweet.  When he's around family and friends that he's comfortable with, he is at his best and fully energized.  He has friends that he would consider close but (not sure if he realizes this), but they are actually just super nice/friendly kids that have lots of friends in his grade.  He loves hanging out with them, but lately the groups have gotten larger.  He'd prefer hanging in a group of 2, but because of their personality, it becomes a group of 10 and that is too large for his more reserved nature.  Plus it seems they are becoming more interested in sports and my son doesn't really care too much for that.

Now his older brother is very much like him and he has 2 very good friends and they do everything together.  This base group has made it very easy for him to feel comfortable doing things outside his comfort zone (like school dances, school events, etc).  I think my younger son needs this, but not really sure how to facilitate it or if I should just let things play out.  I live right down the street from school and work from home.  I honestly did not do this on purpose, but I always take walks after lunch and noticed one of his friends playing basketball when I walked by.  I looked around and saw my son just walking around by himself.  I don't want to read too much into it because that's not totally unlike him, but it did break my heart to see him by himself with all these kids playing.  

The clubs/extracirculars at school are pretty much non-existent this year, but we've already talked about getting him more involved next year so I'm hoping that will spur some friendships for him.  Still though, not sure what to do (if anything) in the meantime.  Is that something to bounce off a school social worker?"
Ok-Birdie	2021-04-26 03:44:01+00:00	Differing views on education	"I’m starting to look at Kindergartens for my kiddo and thinking of the kind of education I would like to her to have. I’ve taken a couple child development classes and early childhood education classes and have learned how important play is. Also that traditional school is very assessment and academic focused while missing the mark on allowing children to use their imagination and intuition for discovery to learn. 
I’m interested in these newer school options while my partner thinks the traditional way is fine. “We learned through the traditional way and have a pretty great life so all worked out.”I think also the concern is that are these play-based schools going to hold her back in any ways from her peers who are learning the traditional way. 

What do you think? Am I worrying about this too soon? 
What’s your experience with traditional or play-based education? 

Thanks for taking the time to reply 😊"
Silent-Anywhere-4706	2021-04-26 03:10:35+00:00	We all think our babies are smart but..	"I just want to brag on my kids a little... theyre twins and have a speech delay (didnt talk much at all until 18 months) i dont have any friends or family to reallly boast about them to but since the video appointments for speech therapy they can now at 26 months do 2-3 word phrases, identify all numbers, shapes, colors, and letters in and out of order, identify animals and the nosises they make, and are starting to add s’s to words. So if any other parents are questioning speech therapy for reasons like its all video due to  the pandemic or whatever, dont. Those women helped me soo much. Not that i was doing anything “wrong” or my kids were  they helped me to see that sometimes we underestimate or over estimating the kids capabilities and are able to give amazing tips on soo many things other than just speech. From hand gestures, to sleep."
JethroJames	2021-04-26 03:06:09+00:00	What is my role during tantrums? Advice seems conflicting	"There seems to be the school of thought that tantrums should be ignored, then there are some who say ignore only tantrums that are manipulative to get things but comfort the others or stay close, then there are those who say it’s fine to comfort any tantrum.

I am very confused as to what is or is not okay. 
My 3 year old has recently begun having tantrums and when this happens if it’s bad enough that she’s falling on the floor or hitting or it’s clear that it’s going to be more than just a minute long etc  I usually bring her into a room with me and I just tell her I’m there if she needs me and proceed to try to wait it out. However, she then usually climbs into my lap and repeats what she wants over and over, screaming and then I don’t know if I should a) ignore completely (this feels kind of cold since she’s looking right at me and is right in my lap   b) try to comfort her and reply to what she’s saying at risk of lavishing attention on it (“as soon as your calm we can go out”, “I know it’s hard but sorry you can’t do xyz right now”)  C) put her down and go into the bathroom or out of the room (I have been going into the en-suite bathroom to wait because the yelling is too much for me and  I think my presence increases it)

When she was 2 she had infrequent tantrums and I would typically just hold and comfort her and they would pass. Recently
if I try to hold and comfort her during these she seems to get mad but if I put her down she yells for mommy and climbs back onto me. If I leave to the bathroom it seems to escalate and extend her tantrum and she throws all of her pillows and toys off the bed and shrieks in frustration.

Any advice greatly appreciated 

Thank you"

LexaLuther1027	2021-04-26 02:56:44+00:00	Supervise your own kids better then..?	"So here is the deal: I live in a three unit complex thing. We all have kids. They’re all friends. Us adults get along, but aren’t exactly friends. We all work and have our own thing going on. Me and my direct neighbor mom (B) are more friendly and will hang outside with our kids in the communal yard area together since we both have younger kids as well as older kids. 

The last neighbor is a complicated household to explain. The adults/parents that live there are a brother (K) and sister (L). (L) has one older boy that plays with our group of kids and (K) has three girls that play with the group. (K) and the mother (S) of the girls have them back and forth a lot, but they mostly are here weekends and after school. 

Well in total there can be up to 8 kids out playing and having fun. It’s great that they have a little gang of friends right here to play with. All kids are always included and welcomed for whatever kid activity, group meals or play going on. 

Here’s the thing, the kids from the third house just kinda run wild and do what they want all hours of the day and night. They drink Mountain Dew like water, run out in the road (small rural town, but still), bring knives/scissors out, convince the younger kids to do things they know isn’t right.... it just doesn’t seem like they are ever really supervised. 

The only adult I really see supervising them is the grandma that goes over there every day. But she doesn’t come outside. I never hear her tell the kids anything.

When my kid (5) is outside playing I always check in on him or watch from the window into the yard. I will go out and say something if I notice anything going on that needs to be addressed. I will tell ALL the kids what’s up if it’s needed. I referee all the bickering and kid drama. I give out snacks and waters occasionally. During summer I am the popsicle mom. 

Well, me and (B) discuss mom stuff and yea, we talk about how those kids are never supervised. it’s not the kids fault, they’re kids. We still include them and try to keep them safe and fed. But our main priority is our own kids. We try not to trample boundaries of other parents, but we never see them around so we just treat them as our own. It’s our village. 

ANYWAYS. So now (S), the girls’ mom, just heard that me and (B) were ‘talking shit’ saying that her kids arent watched and how now she has to break her kids hearts that they can’t be friends with our kids now.... this was a huge Facebook post about how we are such mean bitches talking bad about her kids. 

Uh EXCUSE ME, I do not ever talk bad about kids. They’re kids. If anything, I am concerned for your kids safety and looking out for them. 

I tried reaching out to (S) to talk like adults. She ended up blocking me. I told her that I have tried communicating with (K) about some things regarding the kids and he has told me ‘not my problem’ or just plain doesn’t communicate back. 


If the kids are so supervised why did I find the kids with three pairs of scissors,that came from their house,  trying to scratch out the pavement? 

If they’re so supervised how was it they were at (B)s house for three hours until 930 and no one came looking for them until 9.....? 

Why do I find steak knives and big chains and tool sets and broken glass out in the yard from the oldest boy (9)? 

So yea, I’m concerned they aren’t fully supervised. 
I’m concerned about a lot of things, but I try not to judge other parents cause I’m not a perfect parent. It’s hard. I get it. 

But looking out a window once every few hours doesn’t count (that was the defense that the kids are supervised). 



I’m mostly upset that now the kids won’t be able to be friends and play because the mother of the girls is mad for the wrong reason at the wrong people. 

I don’t talk bad about kids. 
And maybe she should address it with her baby daddy that DOESNT watch her kids...? 
Rather than be mad at the two moms that spend a majority of the time keeping an eye out for the kids and doing fun stuff with them. 

End rant. I didn’t want to do a Book post but I need some outside opinions. Ugh."

Because of my fears around COVID-19, I have previously been a little paranoid about mail and groceries. This stems from my, now, 13 month old being born right has the US went into lockdown.

Because the newborn stage is so time-consuming, I neglected to keep up with changing guidance around COVID-19. SO by the time I resurfaced 4-6 months later, I already had deeply ingrained habits of wiping down groceries and quarantining mail.

NOW: I handle mail and groceries same day and no longer wipe things down, BUT I can’t stop feeling like if I don’t wash my hands after touching groceries, my baby will get COVID.

"Hi follow parents, I have a 15 month old with my ex and now I am being blessed with more time with him which I’m eternally grateful for. He’s a beautiful boy and I love spending time with him but I struggle to get him to nap in his cot. 

He has a bottle of milk and then I try to put him to sleep. At first I just put him in his cot and tried to get him to fall asleep himself like my ex suggested but he cried his eyes out and I couldn’t help but go back into the room to pick him up. This happened a few times that day so I took him for a short ride in my car, he fell asleep and then I took him back home and let him nap in my arms until he woke up.  I have been doing that every week since (once a week) with the exception of two weeks ago when he fell asleep in my arms straight away and I put him down and he napped nicely. But then last week he was back to not sleeping without a car ride. 

From next week, I’m going to have more days with him and I wanted any advice on how I can put him down for his nap efficiently. I heard it isn’t good for a baby to consistently sleep in a car seat. I really don’t think I can just let him cry it out, I know it works for some parents but it makes me feel upset. Does anybody have any advice I could follow? Thank you so much in advance"
peachy888	2021-04-26 02:34:37+00:00	6 month old not really using her hands	"My 6 month old isn't really using her hands. She can bat at her toys if we hang them above her but will never hold onto anything. We wanted to start baby led weaning at this age but when we put food into her hands she'll hold onto it momentarily and then drop it soon after.

I'm getting kinda concerned because lots of babies in her play group who are younger than her seem to have mastered this skill. 

She also hates tummy time. She learned to roll from back to front at around 5 months, but then gets stuck and cries to be flipped over. She can only do tummy time for maybe a minute before screaming out for help.

I just want to know if there are any other babies out there who never held onto things at 6 months. How did they progress, or was it an early symptom of something else going wrong?

Also for bad tummy-timers, did it delay crawling or walking?

Getting quite concerned and any advice would be greatly appreciated."
Lawlmuffin	2021-04-26 02:11:02+00:00	First time	"I know this may be silly, obvious, and goes without saying to a lot of you, but for a first time parent I never really thought of this and wish I had sooner.

When you're out and about with your infant/toddler, be patient with them and take things slow. Don't rush if you can help it! ***They are literally seeing and experiencing the world/new things for the first time.*** Literally every trip out of the house (or even in the house!).. to a park, walk around the neighborhood, ride in the car, etc. Every experience has new sights, smells, feels! We can't even comprehend what that's like. It must be incredible.

So next time you're in a rush, just remember your little one, and try and slow down for them. Once you realize this, it makes going on trips outside even more special."

Not just a head of course but from time to time i could see a childs head... So there was a man driving, a blanked pulled over the front seats so no speed camera could see the kid i guess... He seemed to be speeding too so we got curious and i called the police and told them... Since there was a policecar passing by from the opposite direction they where behind me after like two minutes, and i was on call all the time telling them where he is, the police was behind me and i pulled over to let them pass and stop that guy. His lizence plate was from a region far away from where i was driving and i was scared to let this go cuz i cant know if that guy was kidnapping a kid.

Sry english isnt my native tongue so its written very basic ^^

PLS think about savety for your kids... I cang imagine what would happen to a kid in a trunk in a crash...

Im just relieved i could tell this cuz i was a little bit traumatic to think about if i witnessed a kidnapping and doing nothing."

DuncA07	2021-04-26 01:44:35+00:00	having a hard time considering daycare for 10month old	"I work 8-5pm remotely and have both grandmas in the same city. They both moved to our city to be close to us and help with the baby as much as possible. They both also have children under 10 year olds (young grandmas lol). My mother has had a lot of health issues lately and has not been able to help as much. She also does not really have a set schedule or a car so it can be difficult to work around (i do not have a car, only my husband).

My MIL has 4 homeschooled kids who are busy in sports and is demanding to have a set schedule. Also kind of has hinted that she takes care of baby more than my mom since moving here and has made some remarks that hurt. 

I know my child is well taken care of with both of his grandmothers. But I have no way to plan around their schedules. There are days when I can only work until 1pm or I don’t get to start my workday until 11am. It is causing me stress and to fall behind. Having to work around my moms, MIL, and husbands schedule just to do my job has been so hard. I feel so defeated, but the thought of sending my child to be taken care of by strangers just sends me into ugly crying. He is already walking, super active, eats tons, and well a BABY! Also, daycare in our city is crazy expensive and we will be on a VERY tight budget.

My question is should I just keep trying to make it work with grandmas or look for a daycare? Have any of you been in a similar situation? I just don’t feel truly supported and I feel like I am asking too much out of others."

I'm losing my cool with a lot of what she does and feel like im in a constant cycle of yelling and trying to discipline and her crying. But shes starting to hit and pinch and stuff I would of gotten whooped as a kid for. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to yell at my kid ever and try extremely hard to catch myself and talk to her calmly but lately I'm snapping so easy. My wife is in the same boat, and I want to find a way to fix everything from me yelling, the wife yelling and the little ones attitude and understand what went so crazy this month. 

Can I please get advice?"

It took a while to load, but when it did, there was an image of a woman with her breasts exposed. I could not tell if it was a photo or drawing because he took it away real quick and just looked me dead in the eyes. He then went up to our room (we share it) and just kept on his phone and then took a nap(I am writing this about 7 hours after I saw it). I have not mentioned it and kind of pretended like I saw nothing. Should I approach him about it and tell him it is okay? I know I am not his parent, but I feel like I should do something. For some more background info, he is a triplet and I am the oldest one in the family out of us 4 kids. My mom and dad are actively involved, but I don’t really want to tell them. He really doesn’t have any friends and sees me as his best friend. Thank you all for reading and I look forward to your advice."

She will hold it sometimes and as soon as she is off the toilet she pees in her underwear. She’s successfully went potty twice the past few days. But I can’t seem to get her to tell me when she has to go. I’m trying to be very supportive but I feel like very little progress is being made. I know that this will take longer then three days but my goal is to get her almost potty trained by Wednesday when she goes back to daycare. Any tips? I feel like I’m failing as a parent. 😢

NeuralLink	2021-04-25 23:57:26+00:00	Age appropriateness of toys and tools for a toddler.	"Our child is 2 1/2 years old. We were letting her play in the back yard and she picked up a dandelion puller [like this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0940/1538/products/1NEI059_4059NB_copy_300x.jpg?v=1447248709) and started running with it. I was very upset by this. My wife asserts that it is an okay thing for her to be allowed to hold and use (lightly supervised) whereas I have very strong feelings that it is dangerous and absolutely not something she should be allowed to play with.

We have strongly opposing opinions about this. I would describe my wife as a generally good parent whose parenting style is influenced by a mix of montessori and free range parenting. I would say that I am more cautious with our child's safety than my wife, but would not even begin to describe myself as overly cautious. I think cuts, bumps, and bruises are a normal part of growing up but I feel like with something like this, the consequences of something going wrong could be catastrophic; and that my wife's parenting philosophy is sometimes poorly balanced against the safety of our toddler.

What are other parents' opinions on this specific thing and determining the age-appropriateness of objects or environments more generally?"

7777777idk	2021-04-25 23:12:31+00:00	Advice from a kid who used to hate her parents	"I just want to say it’s never too late to turn things around- it may take time and hard work but seriously, your relationship with your children can change. I remember as a child, my parents were pretty good, there were rough moments but nothing crazy. My older sister always had a type A personality- perfect grades, did sports, sang in a choir, was religious....and then there was me (complete opposite). Since she was older and my parents “raised her first” it was very obvious that raising me as a teenager was a challenge, like as if they’d never raised a teenager before. I struggled...a lot. I had major depression and anxiety and terrible adhd but my parents didn’t understand it- they told me to suck it up, they compared me to my sister and peers. I began drifting away, caring less, and hanging out with older kids who were sort of a bad influence. Me and my sister had a terrible relationship, i resented her mostly for the way she treated me and fat shamed me, but for being everything i could never be. My family was constantly scream fighting, like none of us got along. I used to get in terrible fights with my parents, usually for not completing schoolwork or cleaning my room, but also because they knew i was doing things i “wasn’t supposed to do”. I always felt like they wished i was more like my sister and it hurt. I was never physically abused but i felt very mentally abused and exhausted. I always knew i would be screamed at for something and they just didn’t understand that i was struggling very badly. I was going through things i didn’t feel comfortable telling them about bc i felt like I would be in trouble. When they would barge into my room yelling i would just cry, and that made them more angry. I can still hear my dad screaming “You can’t just bury your head in your hands and cry” and I would just think to myself ....yes.....yes i actually can??? over the years it got to the point where i stopped caring about anything because I knew i would never make them proud. I started skipping school and never completing a single assignment. They ended up moving me to another school bc i was being heavily mistreated by the staff but that’s another story- i beleive this is when things started to turn around. I think they started to see why I was struggling so badly, i just had it rough in highschool. Unfortunately moving schools didn’t end up making anything better and i still was heavily struggling. At this new school tho, the staff actually took notice that i needed guidance. They put me on a 504 plan and had me meet weekly with the school psychologist. Unfortunately more and more shit kept happening in my personal life and i totally gave up. It got to the point where i would refuse to get out of bed in the morning, i would just wake up and cry. I would beg my parents to let me drop out and they didn’t like that, but over time they began to realize it’s what i needed. It was at a point where i had been absent for months. They finally decided they would listen to me and pull me from school and i swear ever since then our relationship has been so solid, like i literally picture them with a halo on their head. They truly changed their ways and i will forever appreciate that. I don’t see them for who they used to be I see them for who they became for me. I think sometimes we forget our parents are growing up just as much as we are. my parents had me at 23 for christ’s sake i mean they were never ready. Now they understand that they just needed time to become the parents i needed. Now they tell me every single day how grateful they are for me and how special i am to them. Now i know in my heart that they really truly love me for who i am and don’t see me as a failure. I guess my point is that despite all the horrible things they’ve said to me in the past, all i think about it how they treat me now. If you’re in a rough place with your children just know it’s not too late to turn it around. My parents and i weren’t on the same page until I was about 17. Now i’m 19 and i could cry every time i think about how much I love them, like i’m sobbing writing this lol. Just make your kid feel loved, it’s all they need."

My ex husband is moving back to his home state which is just the next state over but it’s still more then a 3 hour drive to where he lives. We have three kids together, our 7 month old son, and our two daughters that are 8 and 5. Currently we have 50/50 where he takes them four days a week and I take them five and then we flip it so next time he gets them five and I get them four. With him moving this won’t work anymore and we can’t seem to find common ground in a new agreement. He currently wants them for June, July, and august and any holidays but I’m totally against this. He also suggested taking them just weekends but that’s such a long drive for an overnight visit.

aznuke	2021-04-25 22:42:48+00:00	Tantrum Town	"My son is 2 years old (30 months if it matters).
Whenever we go anywhere, he is a wonderful example of a well behaved child. He is a teachers favorite at his daycare. Even though I am a bit biased, I still maintain that my son is a sweet, generally gentle, loving, smart, and inquisitive 2 year old. 

But at home....oh, at home...

Here we go:
If you say no to the smallest of requests - Tantrum Town
If you have to give him a bath - Tantrum Town
If mom (and only mom) gets up to use the bathroom alone - Tantrum Town.
If you offer him ANY kind of food other than the treat he is asking for - Tantrum Town.
If you snuggle his brother for even a second - Tantrum Town
If he wakes up in the middle of the night and you put him back to bed - Tantrum Town.

Anything can set him off. Anything. And nothing consoles him. You just gotta wait 10, 20, 30 minutes for him to wind down. 

Sometimes he yells in frustration. Most of the time, he hits. A lot of times he throws things (or acts like he's going to throw things)

Mind you, this is only at home. Get him out of the house (literally anywhere) and he's a golden child. But at home, he is another child completely.

I do not know what to do. 
I am baffled.

YellowLedbettah	2021-04-25 22:23:46+00:00	13 year old is scared of kids her age	"Does anybody have any tips with helping my daughter (13) out of her shell? 

My daughter (13) happens to be very very shy around kids her age. Even around her friends shes known since she was 11 shes a very toned down version of herself, which is weird since around adults like her family members and my middle aged friends and especially; *especially* old people for some reason, she has a very powerful presence and doesn't really seem to struggle to keep a flow in a conversation

I asked about it, she confessed to feeling very self conscious and even terrified whenever kids her age are around

She said she would like to get some close friends that are in her age group to but at the same time she said she felt like ""crumpling into a ball"" whenever a kid her age tries to engage a conversation, she said she always ends up babbling something weird and awkward whenever she tries to talk to them.

 She isn't very clear with her wants, Im very confused, and shes kind of a dramatic. (said she'd rather swallow a sword than go to the clubs at school) (i also suggested getting to know her classmates via chatting online if shes scared of actual talking, but she said she doesn't have much of a grasp on socials, and said it would be weird to randomly disturb someones inbox) 

Any tips? Opinions would be lovely too.

Thank you for listening"
nadzicle	2021-04-25 22:12:13+00:00	11 y/o daughter has behaviour issues and I need advice	"FTP, so I’m sorry if there’s a formatting issue here or if the title should have been worded differently.

My daughter has had behavioural issues since she was six. I was told for a year or two that “it was normal” “it’s just a phase girls go through”. As someone who didn’t have a normal childhood (parental abuse, neglect etc), I didn’t really have anything to compare it to so for a time I believed them. After awhile, I was told by friends that this wasn’t normal behaviour (she would scream at me for hours on end at night if she wasn’t given her way, would scream at me when I was dropping her off at school because she wanted me to take her to class, would throw books, had issues staying on task and needed to be constantly told what to do because she would get distracted and forget) and I should get help for myself and for her.

Well, I did. We’ve both been in therapy for a few years now. Unfortunately I’ve had more luck than she has. I’ve tried a few times to get her assessed for adhd, to get her to see a paediatrician, to get extra help and it’s gotten nowhere. She’s on her third psychologist but this one actually seems pretty good. But her behaviour is still pretty terrible. She has a checklist now to keep her on track in that regard, but as I suspected, her emotional age is that of a toddler. Which means when she’s anxious or overwhelmed or upset, I have to regulate for her.

What I need advice with is how to handle the aftermath of her outbursts. As she’s gotten older and started hitting puberty, she’s gotten more angry and aggressive. She spirals pretty fast and refuses to calm down or try the methods we’ve been given over the years. If she realises we’re trying to calm her, she’ll do something to keep herself angry. Last night, because she was told no for a few things, she was screaming about me clearly hating her and she hates me and she doesn’t care, and I’m mean. It was suggested she spend some quiet time in her room to calm down and she refused and went into my housemates room and under one of the beds in there. I decided to try what the current psych suggested of just letting her know I was there for her and that we could try deep breaths and quiet time. She spent 12 minutes making noises because she said that she didn’t want to do what I said. Because I said it. It was two hours of screaming and vitriol towards myself and my housemate. I don’t know how I’m supposed to deal with her afterwards. Dealing with the outbursts is hard enough, but does she get consequences, do I go stricter? I’ve done positive reinforcement and reward systems to no effect, I’ve been super strict with rules and consequences to no effect. I don’t know what to do aside from what I’m doing, and it’s so damn exhausting.

Many methods have been tried, I’ve read the PPP stuff, we’ve tried exercise, meditation, yoga, the colour chart, counting, breathing exercises, talking versus not talking, consequences versus none. She isn’t an abused kid, she’s very loved, gets told so daily, she gets affection and attention. Yet she acts like she’s treated horribly. Even right now, at 8am, she’s acting as though she didn’t do anything last night and is being rude and disrespectful. And all I did was ask her if she had clothes on the floor and if that’s where they belonged, followed by telling her to pick them up.

I’m so tired from it. I love her and I’m trying my best here, I’m in the process of trying the paed route again and gathering all the info I need for the referral, but that obviously takes time. Her father is only around fortnightly on weekends and she goes to his mums place for their time. He refuses to think she has anything going on, although recently he’s decided that she must have asd and has been telling her that. I’m sorry for the ramble, I’ve never asked for help on a group before, I don’t know what to put in here."

Example: most kids in the USA get Presidents Day off, but most adults don’t get that paid holiday. How do you manage childcare for one random holiday for your kids? Especially when you get less PTO than the number of school holidays.

Do you hire a random babysitter for the day? Use your PTO and stay off with the kids? 

Also, for parents that get less PTO then the number of school holidays do you take an unpaid day off or hire a random babysitter and just earn less that week?"

Thatlldodonkeykong	2021-04-25 21:46:09+00:00	How do I approach this with Daycare?	"My three year old told me yesterday to “shut up.” Today she told her dad the same thing. Both times it caught us off guard and we talked through the whole thing of that’s not nice, what’s a nice way to ask someone to be quiet or to stop being loud. THENNNN we went through some investigation questions. “Who says that?” “Miss Angie” is that someone at school or on your videos? “That’s my teacher” “does she say that to you or your friends or someone else?” She gave some Silly answer I couldn’t understand. “When she says it is she being mean or being silly?” “Mean.” 

TWICE! In two days my sweet baby has said her teacher says shut up. And twice my child has told her parents to shut up because of it. 

I’m pretty mad. That’s completely unacceptable to say in front of kids at daycare! My husband said I need to be cool and calm but I think I need to be a little spicy and let them know i won’t be paying for childcare that continues to behave this way and teach my child this.

lklanghow	2021-04-25 21:40:58+00:00	Newborn Sleeping Habits	"Hi hi. New mom here. I don’t have a ton of “mom friends” so I come to Reddit for support..

I am wondering about the sleeping patterns of my daughter. She is just past 9 weeks old. I’m just wondering if it’s normal to have some days where she is super sleepy still, and some days where she never seems to want to take a nap. 

Yesterday and the day before, she’d take short little cat naps all day and be super alert and active, while getting one solid 90-120 nap in at some point. 

Today, it seems like all she wants to do is sleep. It feels like she’s slept more than she’s been awake. (And for the last two weeks she has consistently been going to bed for the night between 8-9pm and waking up between 6-7am, with one feeding session that’s sometime been 2-3am)

She seems to have this pattern every week on a bout a 2-4 day pattern. 

It really freaks me out and concerns me when she’s has a super sleepy day. I get really nervous that she doesn’t feel like well, or it’s indicative of something greater than what we can see. She just seems really lazy and different than her other days. My husband and mom don’t see reason for concern, but I can’t help but get a little nervous. 


(Also, she eats really well and has been gaining like 8-10 oz a week since she was two weeks old. Great wet and dirty diapers. She is also strong and can hold herself up during tummy time.)"

Our daughter turned 1 last week and she’s been fantastic for this whole first year. She is non stop laughing, smiling, giggling, eats well, sleeps and naps well, plays well and seems really intelligent. However she’s never been much of a mover. She lays on her front to play and will roll around to move to toys etc, but any attempts to get her onto all fours or if we put something in front of her to crawl towards results in a meltdown. Standing wise she can stand up if we put her in the position and she’ll hold herself at the table etc, but will only really pull herself up from our knees or a pillow, she doesn’t do much climbing or pulling up at all. 

Now I’m not sure if I’m here to see if anyone else experienced similar and suddenly they started crawling/walking at 13/14 months or if people can offer advise, but coming out of lockdown now and seeing family, friends etc we face the obvious questions of “is she not crawling/walking yet?!” Etc.

Which makes total sense. We’ve been trying to get her to take a nap during the day alone in her crib (obviously with the monitor pointed at her so we can watch). But we’re struggling.

She loves to wave her arms around a bunch, so that typically wakes her up. Overnight she sleeps in a sleep sack that allows her arms to be up but zipped inside as well. 

Anyway, it’s very difficult to get things done during the day (or sneak in a nap for ourselves) if she doesn’t nap alone during the day. She will sleep if one of us is holding her.

Any ideas?"

I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

CerousRhinocerous	2021-04-25 21:08:15+00:00	Is there anything I can do here? Will our relationship always be broken?	"I have an adult son, the eldest of my children, and he is a good guy with a good heart. He is quite solitary and spends a lot of time on the computer. He does hold down a fairly demanding job and is responsible, but he is staying away from relationships, and I worry he is lonely and unfulfilled.

I had him when I was quite young (1990), and there were a number of things in my life that I messed up back then. I was not a bad mother, but I wasn’t ready to be a mother. The person he grew up thinking of as his dad was not his biological dad. The family knew - I wasn’t tricking them, but we decided early on that we just wanted him to feel like he was as much a part of the family, and so we never told him then. He was treated with kindness and accepted without question, but the marriage was rocky and immature. As my son got older, there never seemed to be a good time to tell him. I got divorced from my first husband in 1998, after several years of separation where I was basically a single mom and the sole breadwinner for the family. I did my best. In 2004 I married again, to a good guy who did his best to co-parent my two kids. Life got better, and my son went through his teenage years with me and his stepdad in a harmonious household, but with some of the typical high school turbulence. It didn’t seem like a good time to tell him then either. 

Fast forward and he became an adult, and I realized that I didn’t want to keep this a secret from him forever. I was afraid he would get on of those 23&amp;me tests and he’d know and feel betrayed and I didn’t want that. I’m the person he should hear it from. So one weekend when I knew we’d have a long time to talk with no interruptions, I gathered my info together and I got up the courage to tell him everything. I gave him all the options, I let the family know that he might be reaching out to them to talk about this. I apologized for all of it. I was prepared to do whatever he wanted or needed me to do to help settle this in his mind. I also wanted him to know and understand that ultimately, though, he was loved, and we all truly were his family. Even my exes’ family, and my new family - we all love him and care about him and want the best for him. 

That was like 7 years ago. For a while, we talked about it a lot, but then it sort of seemed like he was ready to put the topic aside. I thought he was moving past it, but recently I learned that he is still really angry with me about it, and that he feels like he’s stuck in a loop thinking about it and can’t let it go. It’s keeping him from being whole and happy and having confidence in himself. He could take some action to find his birth dad, or talk to us about it or something...but he doesn’t. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know if I should bring it up, apologize some more, or what. It hurts me to know that there is this rift between us, and I wish there was something I could do, but I feel like anything I would do at this point would only add salt to the wound. 

What would you do in this situation?"

I'm terrified of asking for a c section and being denied (for anyone telling me not to have a c section, I have thought about this for years and it is my preference). 

People are having babies all the time, and I keep getting told that it's not so bad and if it was then people wouldn't be having more kids. I just feel like crying picturing myself having to go through this. 

Its almost enough to put me off ever having kids, and I'm scared the fear will win and I'll try and tell myself that I never wanted one anyway.

Today was a nice day for the most part, but after being on baby duty with our 18 month old all day I was starting to get a bit frazzled as the day went on. Even when LO napped I was getting jobs done including things for my partner that he wanted done but didn't want to do it himself so he asked me to do it, all the while he is playing computer games. I finally finished the errands and I fire up my PC to have an online game with my partner, the round starts and LO wakes up. Despite having been playing for nearly 2 hours already my partner makes no effort to go to LO so it's up to me to leave and go see to him.

I entertain LO for a while, we play, read, sing, go outside and whatnot and it is soon time to get dinner ready so I let my partner know and give him the choice of cooking or looking after LO. He opts to look after LO, which is great for me as I'm ready for a bit of a break and I can stick netflix on when I'm cooking. I get things ready in the kitchen, put my netflix show on (which isn't a show that's suitable to have on when LO is around) and after about 2 minutes my partner comes in with LO and sits in the kitchen playing on the tablet. I turn netflix off and am now cooking around a very inquisitive 18 month old whose new favourite thing is emptying the kitchen cupboards while my partner plays games and half heartedly keeps an eye on LO.

Things really start getting tough during dinner, this week LO has decided he's not going in his high chair he wants to be in a regular chair however we don't have a booster seat yet (it's getting ordered tonight!), so it's a juggling act of keeping him on the chair and feeding him, whilst also eating my own dinner and my partner is still playing on the damn tablet. After I finish eating LO is just being a massive fidget so I pick him up and notice he has peed and his nappy leaked so his trousers are wet. I'm getting quite stressed now and I ask my partner does he want to change LO or clear the table, he says he'll clear the table. I change LO and go back into the kitchen to see my partners idea of clearing the table is putting our two plates near the sink, LO's dish is still out, the glasses and placemats are still out and the food that LO spread across the table is still there so I have to clear that away.

We cobath with LO and my partner offered to do it today, so he ran himself a bath and stayed in for about 20 minutes before asking me to bring LO in, at which point he told me he forgot a towel so when I bring LO's towel could I bring him one too (he always does this), I know it's not a big deal because I'll be grabbing LO's anyway, but during the 10 minutes he will have LO in the bath I have to change our bedding, check the temperature of LO's bedroom, make sure I've got the right tog grobag for that temp, find him a sleepsuit and set up the changing mat for drying LO off and getting him ready for bed.

After doing all that, I take LO out of the bath to dry him off and get him ready for bed, he isn'tcooperating, and he doesn't want his nappy on, it's just a whole ordeal. Finally he's dressed, my partner is out of the bath and I go to the bathroom mainly just to have 5 minutes to myself. My partner has done nothing with LO since, his hair is still wet, he's no closer to being ready for bed. I blow dry his hair do his teeth, get him in his grobag and start the bedtime routine.

At this point my partner asks if I'm okay, I tell him I'm just a bit overwhelmed with everything and he says ""well if there is anything I can do, let me know"". Seriously?!?! Just think when you do things!! Help out during the day, don't play on the tablet all the time, when I'm doing a job and you're looking after LO keep him out of the way, actually follow through with jobs you opt to take on instead of leaving it for me to finish them, you know LO can't go to bed with wet hair so take some initiative and grab the hair dryer instead of waiting for me to do it, be fair when it comes to down time, value my time as equal to yours!

""if there is anything I can do, just let me know"" - I can't tell you how much I hate that phrase, it feels like such a lazy cop out. You can see there are a million things to do, just pick one!


Also, the amount of time he has spent on the tablet these last few days is ridiculous, it has been almost constant. I have spoken to him about the amount of time he spends playing games while he is with LO before and he eased up for a while but it started up again. And only earlier this week we decided to make an effort to stay off our phones and keep the TV off during the day as LO isn't talking yet and we read that can be delayed by having screens on, in fact the following morning after that discussion he came downstairs when I was giving LO his breakfast and I had put the news on and my partner called me up on it and ""reminded"" me that we had agreed to keep it to a minimum. 

Sorry for rambling and generally being a Debbie Downer, if you are still reading thank you very much for putting up with me! I think I needed to get that off my chest."

How do you go about finding the baby sitters? Recommended websites or agencies you have used and had good experiences.

Nanny cams, how hide and good brand?

Thank you all for your advice."
Misfitty	2021-04-25 20:31:34+00:00	Dislike daughters boyfriend. How to deal.	"My daughter (20) has a 22 year old boyfriend. Their relationship consists of him coming over (usually late) spending the night, laying in bed then leaving. The only activities they do is going to his sports games (which she hates) and occasionally going to lunch. Other than that they’re just in her bedroom in bed. She’s tried to get him to go swimming or bowling but he doesn’t want to. Then he’ll leave after spending the night and go do activities with his friends. She also buys him food frequently. Yes he buys food for her as well sometimes but the frequency at which she pays for stuff bothers me. She works part time and is in school so she doesn’t have a lot of money. 

This is going to sound unjust and ridiculous but he frequently takes the most horrifically smelly shits. Like I’m glad you’re so comfortable guy. When he’s here I just want him out. I know he’s just laying in her bed. This is their relationship: he comes over, gets laid, eats, shits, then takes off to do his own thing. It’s infuriating. 

Do I bring this up to her? If so how should I approach it? Maybe I could limit his sleepovers to just twice a week. 

TL:DR
Hate when my daughters boyfriend spends the night and wish he treated her better."
whits900	2021-04-25 19:49:45+00:00	Believing everything on the internet	"My 10 year old son has recently been repeating things he has “learned” or thinks is just cool/awesome/interesting from certain YouTube videos or other sites, many of which are (to me) obviously fake and done to get viewers or more people to their site (yes locked down and all age appropriate). However, my son thinks it’s all real. Nothing I say will convince him otherwise. His response? They’re nice people they wouldn’t lie. He’s on the autism spectrum, and once he’s convinced of something it sticks. I want and *need* him to be able to think critically, and understand that not everything on the internet can be believed. Right now I’m here to monitor it, and the subject matter isn’t of much consequence, but eventually it will be. I know he’s young and he could just naturally “grow out” of this belief, but it scares me, knowing how much craziness there is out there (and how easy it is for all the crazies to get together online) and I don’t want him getting sucked into that. I just have no idea how to help him gain this skill. I guess I’m just looking for advice or checking if anyone has experienced the same thing, and how they dealt with it."

"Our toddler is finally old enough to sign up for extracurriculars - toddler soccer, ballet “dance with me,” intro to gymnastics... Thanks to COVID, we didn’t get to do anything structured before now like library time or playgroup, etc. So the concept of “it’s time for __ class!” is pretty new.

How did you introduce your kid to these activities? What do you do if the kid tantrums or doesn’t participate? How long do you stick with something before trying something else?"

MindlesslyMindfull	2021-04-25 19:32:16+00:00	0 is the number of things it takes to satisfy that which is NEVER satisfied.	"How do you satisfy an 8 year old  child that is literally NEVER satisfied with ANYTHING?
 Even if/when she gets EXACTLY what she ""wants""...?... It is NEVER EVER EVER good enough. Not even slightly. Not even if it's better than what she had/did before that. 

She will constantly find something to complain about, something that makes EVERYTHING that's presently there, or going on in the moment, unbearably NOT good enough. Holy unsatisfiable discontentment. It's ALWAYS something, she wants it different. And she WILL make sure to have a crappy attitude the entire time until she gets what ""she wants"" 
She'll throw the most absurd and drawn out, over-the-top fits, for literal HOURS (I am not even slightly exaggerating, no joke) and regardless of if we give in, stand ground, (attempt) compromise, or do EXACTLY the thing she wanted to do (before, during or after).... It still DOES NOT STOP. 

Even When we do the thing, go to the place, leave the place, cook the food, watch the movie etc.  that SHE wants... It's never good enough. She refuses to be content, satisfied, pleased. Happy, OK WITH .. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. 

This is not just a ""phase"" 
It's full blown control issues.
But not even, because having control of ANYTHING,
ANYTIME
ANYWHERE
ANY WAY..
""Simply"" DOES NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE!

It is causing problems with my relationship, our family, and every single part of daily anything. I don't know what else to do.

I want to give up on her, her mom, our ""family"" in general..

 I can't do it anymore.

 She wasn't always like this. But I am losing any patience I have left. It's almost not worth the frustration/stress/anxiety/anger/sadness/time/etc at this point."

I'm in need of a sense check as I'm becoming increasingly worried about my son. 

From when he was a newborn, my 7 month old has semi-regularly experinced short episodes of choking/gasping for air. These would happen sometimes when feeding, as he slept or just randomly throughout his day. This weekend though, it's happened 3 times, one of which he was really struggling to catch his breath and it frightened the life out of me. Each time was while he wasn't eating or drinking. 

Is this normal in any way, does anyone out there have the same? It was really only happening maybe once or twice every 3 weeks or so. I'd put it down to him swallowing funny and it going down the wrong way but this weekend has me worried out of my mind that it's something more serious. 

Any thoughts or advice before I call the doctor tomorrow very welcome, thank you!"
drewxangel	2021-04-25 19:00:59+00:00	My brother (9m) shits on himself &amp; I need advice badly (sister 20)	"So my brother (9m) has always shit his pants sadly &amp; everyone in our immediate family knows. Everyone has talked to him, yelled at him &amp; even tried to be understanding. It's getting really old this has been happening pretty much most his life. My mother is a single mom &amp; she can only do some much she has done everything she can to try to help him but he keeps shitting on himself. 

His health 
My brother has had a health condition regarding going #2 &amp; it was a very rare condition where all his organs were literally filled with 9 years worth of shit. That has been taken care of got medication for it &amp; followed all the steps. He still continues to have problems &amp; we are all tired of it... 

Family 
My brother's father (technically we are half siblings but I claim him as my brother) is pretty much out the picture so no real father figure &amp; no discipline from a man besides our grandpa. Like I said before my mother is taking care of this situation pretty much on her own. She has tried paying him money each time he goes in the toilet, had explained to him boys his age don't do this anymore. I mean it's not normal to see your brother wash his own shitty underwear where the dishes go &amp; he says that he's used to doing that.

We are all very angry at him when it comes to this &amp; none of us know what to do anymore... I've even jokingly told my mom to get him diapers.. has anyone experienced this &amp; how long did it go on? Advice would be appreciated &amp; thank you."
NeganLucielle	2021-04-25 18:51:23+00:00	Is the family dynamics changing?	"Just curious if others are in the same situation. I was born in the 70's, currently in my upper 40's. While growing up way back when with my Boomer parents, I was always told at 18 we would be out of the house. My parents made good on their word with my two older brothers. Both left on bad terms and joined the military. I was only a year after them but left at 19 to join the Corps myself. College wasn't really an option. My dad told me before I left that I could stay at home and find work but he would have me pay rent until I found my own place. I thought my best option to learn a skill/trade was through the military. I felt I needed to do it to see what else was out there. 

Fast forward 20 years. I have 2 older sons, 20 and 18. I can't see just kicking them out to find their own way. Ones working as a cook, and the one graduated from the fire academy to be a firefighter, but only getting experience at a volunteer department. Neither of them can afford to live by themselves. I would like to encourage them to spread their wings but can't throw them out in a society that they can't financially live in.

We rent a 4 br house. We want to buy a house but this area is SOOO EXPENSIVE. What we qualify for doesn't exist. Wife wants a 4 br house so the boys will always have a place to come back to. I understand that, to a point. It doesn't exist in this area. We would potentially have to move 6 hours away (another state) to get something in our price range. We've already packed up and moved 6 hours from our original home state to work here. 

I feel like I'm trapped between a rock and a hard place. I don't think it's fair to force them out, but I think my wife's belief about maintaining a 4 br house to have a place for them to move back to is a little unrealistic as it doesn't exist in out budget in this area. I also don't feel right asking them to pay rent if we continue to stay here. No telling how long we will be able to rent this home."
chacharella	2021-04-25 18:44:23+00:00	Reciprocating bad behavior back onto the kid	"I feel a bit naive about this but here goes:

My husband is a big fan of reciprocating bad behavior back onto the kid that did it. For example, my 5yo son hit the dog, which he knows is not nice or allowed. My husband might then hit my son--not hard as far as I can tell, but definitely enough to make my son whine. Then ask him, ""Did you like that?""

I don't like this form of parenting. I try to be on the ""gentle parenting"" end of the spectrum but it's hard to convince my husband that it is a better approach when is not always effective. I don't want my kids to have to fear their parents. I do want them to respect us and understand our role as the household authorities. 

This whole thing gets me in a spiral of doom mindset which isn't helped by my depression and anxiety. I take meds and see a therapist. My therapist has, in the past, encouraged me to try and understand and respect my husband's perspective (how he was raised affecting how he might want to parent) but I don't my husband's approach is even socially acceptable in this day and age... Is it?"
StrangerSkies	2021-04-25 18:29:52+00:00	You don’t “have” to sleep train	"I got a lot of pushback for not sleep training my daughter. She had a rough time falling asleep and other mothers blamed me to my face for this. Instead, we co-slept for many years, and then around the time she was five, we moved into a place with separate bedrooms. 

For the last two years, we snuggle while she colors and I read to her for half an hour. Then I put on an audiobook, and we snuggle until she’s all the way asleep. Often, I end up napping for a bit with her. She wakes up around 1 am, comes into my bed, and curls up with me for the rest of the night. 

I cherish our bedtime routine, and the closeness it gives us at the close of the day. I am happy to keep that time sacred for her, to guide her into sleep with peace and gentleness. I love tiptoeing away once she’s fully asleep, and getting a last look at my favorite face in the world at the end of my day. 

It’s not a solution for everyone. But I just ran across a post where a tired mother was told she *must* sleep train her baby, and I wanted to offer what a few years down the road of not sleep training looks like for my kiddo and for me."

Needless to say.... it’s never too early to show your kids step by step how to fix things around the house. Those skills are super valuable for the future and will make them more independent.

electriccweenie	2021-04-25 18:00:20+00:00	People keep making jokes about my son not being mine and it's getting old.	"Okay so my wife (white) and I (black + white) have 2 beautiful children. My daughter (4) looks almost exactly like me with the darker skin and the more black facial features. But my son (2) almost looks nothing like me. Has blondish hair and bright blue eyes. Still has some of my features but at first glance you wouldn't even know he was my kid. This has led to a lot of awkward staring from strangers. As well as the obligatory ""ask your wife about the mailman"" jokes. At first it was kinda funny,  ""Haha, yeah he's probably not mine"" but now it's just gotten old. 

And before you ask, no, my wife would never step out on me. Yes he's actually mine. Genetics are weird sometimes and you never know how the kid will end up looking. Especially for bi-racial people.

Look I know how to take a joke better than anybody. I'm in the Navy, it's basically in our job description... Maybe I'm being overly sensitive but it's starting to bother me more and more every time I hear it. My issue is how do I tell people to cool it without sounding like a dick or too sensitive?"
Jime2Shoes	2021-04-25 17:48:47+00:00	Teen Age Common Practices	"The girl I am dating has two teen age girls, 13 and 15. Since staying with her I have noticed things that they do that really grind my gears.

I consider myself a very laid back dude and I tend to not let much get too me. So I ask myself am I being picky or mean. That's why I'm here; to see if it's just me.

Here is just a small list of the type of things:

-Lie and manipulate their mother.
-never close the door after using the microwave.
-leave everything on all the time. Lights, TV, etc., Even while they are gone to school and such.
-don't flush after they use restroom.
-refuse to do any chores.
-want pets but never take care of them.
-never use the first thing up before opening another. There is 4 ketchups, mustards, miracle whips, sour creams, etc. In the fridge, all half used, and none grouped together. Same thing with the milk. 
-leave wrags and towels crumpled in corner till they smell like mold.
-the list goes on and on.

To me, they are the laziest, most unappreciative kids I have ever seen. I don't feel like we ask too much of them. Their mom gets on to them every day but never really punishes them and I feel it's not my place to but it's driving me crazy. I tried to get everything up to par and implement basic knowledge routines but it turned me into the maid. I'm not a clean freak but I'm a neat non wasteful person. 

Are my common Practices not so common? Is my bar to high or are these teens doomed to never be independent like their older siblings?"

palebot	2021-04-25 17:44:51+00:00	Son following a troubled kid at school.	"I say troubled because I don’t want to say a 5 year old is a bully, but our son, who is 4, seems to idolize this older child at their Montessori. From what we understand the older boy has some sensory issues that might contribute to an intense need for stimulation. But there also seems to be some other things going on at home that seem to feed into this or provide a vehicle for how he expresses this need. He’s violent and does violent things and says violent things. He tells the girls he wants them to break their arms. He throws things at kids. He pulls hair, and punches, and bites other kids. He always wants to play the bad guys. Etc. 

Well, our son loves older kids, especially ones who seem to go by their own tune. He has a lot of friends at school, but apparently is the only kid who plays with the older boy. And when he does he cheers the boy on and follows him. From what we understand he’s not hurting others but he’s still making poor choices.

Some other parents have seen the same issue and brought it up with their teacher, as we have. They’ve verbally discouraged their kids from playing with the boy. I can’t do that. I heard one little boy told him “my mom says I can’t play with you,” and the older boy was in tears. It’s heartbreaking. 

That said, we’re having a hell of a time getting our son to recognize his pal’s problematic choices and not think they’re the bees knees. We’re trying to handle some issues we hear about, realizing that most of the intel is stuff our son tells us or that his sister snitches: heresy from 4 year olds is no route to a solution. 

We’ve tried to go with, “if there’s a huge issue, the teachers will tell us and have a better sense of what’s happening at school.” But we just worry that this relationship is shaping his behavior at home. Given that he’s also going through a fairly natural defiant stage doesn’t help. And as my son, he might have a little ADHD, which I’m about 500 % confident I had growing up that was undiagnosed (and in hindsight explains a lot but also makes me even more committed to my son not having to have some experiences I had).

But we are running out of solutions to figure out how to convince him to make better choices. He’s too young to understand consequences fully, and he doesn’t understand that his friend has some issues. We’ve tried rewards, encouragement, trying to role play being a leader and kind, etc. He’s a sweet loving boy, but whenever the thought of his friend pops up, it’s like a trigger to perform being this boy.

Any suggestions or thoughts."

I love her absolutely, but I would feel better being her aunt or sister or something. She usually stays with my grandmother because I just can not handle her—and she is such a good child!

I just don’t want to be a mother. I never wanted children, but I was raped and talked out of an abortion. Sometimes I think, “I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have this child, I would lose my mind.” And other times I just wish I could give up rights to a family member or something. I’m not a good mother at all, I’m very selfish and I never play with her. I am always stressed around her. It’s just a bad situation to be stuck in."
sunshineandflipflops	2021-04-25 17:00:15+00:00	"Privacy and family advice needed, possible trigger warning."	"So I am almost 16 wks pregnant and we had an anatomy scan Friday. 

I have a genetic abnormality that caused the doubling of my sex organs ( I have a double vaginal opening, doubled uteri, and 4 separate ovaries). From the scan my husband and I learned that our unborn son also has this genetic abnormality ( doubled penis, we are unsure  about everything else and will be seeing a specialist) 

I am a little on edge about it. I remember growing up and my genitalia being common knowledge among my family. I also remember feeling like a side show and a medical experiment. I felt like some sort of freak. When I was about 8 or 9 one of my uncles fingered me, he said he was curious, my dad nearly killed him ( yes, my uncle went to jail for it). 

When I started dating it was a source of embarrassment and insecurity for me. I was not okay with my genitalia being common knowledge at all. 

Now that I know that my son will have the same genetic abnormality I am very worried about it. I do not want my child to feel the way I felt. I talked to my husband about wanting our child's anatomy to be private, but he brought up the fact that someone in the family will most likely be babysitting. We can't control what they do with that information. I pretty much told my husband that I want it to be a need to know basis only. 


It scares me that everything I went through may repeat with my child. 

I know when he gets older it will be his decision as to who knows but I don't want anyone to know before my child is comfortable with his own body. 

Am I worrying too much? What should I do?"

Anyways, I am big movie fan, love to watch all the classics  and award winners .... so one night after the Kids were asleep I decided to do a rewatch of Saving Private Ryan. I had never actually seen the movie straight through, just bits and pieces on HBO back in the day. (My mother didn’t like violent movies playing in the house, so I had to kinda watch it on the down low) Anyways I start Saving Private Ryan and I’m impressed/horrified by the first 24 minutes. But as soon as big battle scene was over, and Tom Hanks character started dropping words like ranger and quadrant, I just couldn’t take Saving Private Ryan seriously. Of course those phrases obviously fit the movie, but all I could think of was a certain space ranger for the gamma quadrant. From that point on every inspirational or emotional speech Tom Hanks delivered, was ruined by years of Toy story being burned into my brain. When the soldiers talked about duty, my brain went to Andy and all I could think was “ehhh get outta there solider, Andy will get over it, he can buy a new toy.”"

Gshaw1995	2021-04-25 15:44:31+00:00	Leap #8 is by far the worst leap we've gone through.	"My LO has had some rough times but i can't think of anything this bad. It's like she's a newborn again and she's two days away from being one. She gotten pretty good at communicating her needs (we use baby sign language) and we follow her cues. If she starts pushing away from us while we're holding her, she generally wants to get down. If she starts playing with her food, rather than eating it, she's generally done. Now the signals are so mixed that it's frustrating for all of us. It's like we just can't get it right. She starts pushing away from us, so we put her down with her toys: cue screaming. She starts playing with her food, we take it away. Cue screaming and rubbing her belly 5 minutes later cause she's hungry and she forgot when she started playing with her food. Independent play is a non starter anymore, she wants us to literally sit with her and do nothing cause her toys don't interest her and she only wants to play with things she really shouldn't like cords and the dog food. Any advice??"
ennuiismymiddlename	2021-04-25 15:43:04+00:00	Water drinking	"Do any of you folks find that you have to actually NAG your kids to drink water throughout the day?  Our kids are 22, 17, 11, and 6 - and every last one of them would shrivel up like a prune if we didn’t nag/remind them to drink water all day long.  We don’t buy soda, but we do always have OJ in the fridge - and they will drink ONLY that, if left on their own - and not even enough for it to be hydrating.  

These kids will complain they have constipation, muscle cramps, headaches, etc- and then admit they haven’t had water all day and act like it’s not connected.  And get mad at us for constantly telling them to drink more water.  It’s crazy.  The 6 year old, I can understand.  He’s 6.  He needs us to remind him.  But the other kids have no excuse.  They don’t even complain about the taste of our water - they just hate water in general. 

I know there’s stuff you can add to water to make it taste different and sports drinks and whatnot, but why add chemicals and sugars if our water is perfectly clean &amp; fine the way it is.      And don’t get the wrong idea - I’m not opposed to other drinks.  I love many types of beverages.  But in my opinion, water should be the foundation of our hydration if it’s available to us.  How do I get my kids to understand this?  

I know in the grand scheme of things this is a very minor, first world problem.  Billions of people don’t have the privilege of having clean water running right out of the faucets.  And I AM VERY GRATEFUL that my family and I have access to it.   

I just wish my kids would listen to us and realize how important it is."
DhangitBobbeh	2021-04-25 15:29:09+00:00	Should this be done privately or together?	"Hey! Me and my wife are expecting. I already have one child 7 years old from a previous marriage. Me and her mom share 50/50 custody. 

Today marks 3 months pregnant for my wife and we were going to sit down with the 7 year old and tell her. After she gets told, me and my dauguter will take a private walk around the block incase she has any questions or concerns she want to address privately away from her step mom. 

My 7 year Olds mom is very upset over the fact her step mom will be there when she finds out she will be getting a sibling. I personally feel like it's important that the step mom is there to break the news as it shows we are a united family and no one is excluded.

Kyliekacey1	2021-04-25 15:28:54+00:00	I found out that my 19 yr old son is bi and has a boyfriend	"So I found out about 2 weeks ago. I noticed he left at really late hours and asked him what was up and he ended up telling me his friend was his boyfriend. He sneaks into their house late at night and his boyfriend’s parents are not accepting of their son’s sexuality, so that worries me. He wasn’t planning on telling me and wants me to act like I don’t know. But I want him to be able to talk to me about the ups and downs of his relationship. I don’t care that he is bi and has a boyfriend, I still love him with all my heart. I don’t know why I’m crying about it all the time, I guess I feel bad for him that he felt so ashamed when he told me. Any advice or just support would be appreciated. I am just so worried about how the world is going to treat him."

My husband(37m) and I(38f) were told at the beginning of the month that our autistic son had failed his vision screening, and we took him to see the eye doctor. He is very farsighted and needs to wear them all the time.

He picked out frames and a strap to go with them. The strap he ordered will arrive in 2 days. He likes the way he looks and knows that he sees better while wearing them. However, he told us that they are uncomfortable. Hence, he has left them on the floor many, many times where anyone, including his twin sister, can step on them despite attempting to explain that they need to go back in their case.

My husband and I have never worn glasses for this purpose and his sister doesn't need them (yet, could still happen). Other than the straps and constant reminders, what else can we do to make sure that our son wears his glasses? Any suggestions are welcome, thanks!"

When he was having trouble sleeping in his room we came up with a plan. He sleeps in his bed everyday during the week but gets to sleep in our bed with us on Saturday nights. This has worked well. Giving him one night a week helped him stay in bed the other nights. Lately he has been asking to come in our bed a lot more and when we tell him no he gets a sad look on his face and says, ""Do you still love me?"" We tell him that of course we love him and reassure him but when we bring him back to him room and tuck him back in he will ask again. He stays in his room after that but I am getting concerned that he feels unloved or uncared for. Are we handling this all wrong?"
FastL4n3	2021-04-25 14:57:50+00:00	Need advice for situation with 18 y.o autistic boy with a mental state of a young kid	"
I started seeing a woman and it became serious. She has an autistic/behind son who is 18 and is supposedly stuck at the mentality of a ten year old. He’s very closed off and spends all his time in his bedroom. He’s really depressed and every time I have tried to reach out to him I couldn’t get more than a few words out of him. His dad isn’t in the picture.

I have been spending nights at her place so we can sleep together and then one day out of nowhere this kid says if I come over he will stab me. His mom tells me this and that he is acting out. I go over anyways and he comes walking out of the apartment with a pocket knife and comes at me essentially trying to stab me. She has no control over him and is helpless to stop this. 

I did not call the police or fight him I just allowed him to chase me out and I haven’t been back in over a week because he says he will murder me if I do. I’m hesitant to involve police and he is closed off to any communication from me or her. Is there any professional help I can get? Does anyone have any recommendations? Please help this is destroying my relationship and I love this woman."

hrhughes8	2021-04-25 14:43:38+00:00	How to talk to in laws about being vaccinated around my child	"Our child was only 3 months old when the pandemic hit. We lived one mile away from my mother in law who had my brother in law, his two children, and during the pandemic my two sisters in laws. Everyone worked from home and quarantined so our son continued to see his family until my two sisters in laws left to go back to college. Then my mother in law started to go out and so did everyone else while my partner and I quarantined with our son. We moved 3 states away for a job opportunity, it was a huge fit with my mother in law she claimed I was taking her son and grandson away. Fast forward 6 months we haven't seen any family and this summer will make it almost a year of seeing my sisters in laws. But one of them is getting married, very small wedding everyone will be vaccinated and masked. My partner and I have debated going but one sister in law and mother in law refuse to get vaccinated. For no particular reason either. Just saying ""we don't get the flu shot so why should we get the covid shot, we could survive if we got covid"". All past reasoning with so my partner told his family that after the wedding no one will be allowed to see our child unless vaccinated. I'm not even sure we should go to the wedding but am here for telling them that they will have to forgo seeing our child unless vaccinated. It has spurred enormous emotions and pretty sure it's going to blow up even more. But is that to much to ask or tell? Are we the assholes?"
ObjectiveCorgi89	2021-04-25 14:40:21+00:00	What were the earliest signs of ADHD or other behavioral things?	"Just wondering if my kiddo is just extreme, or if there is something else going on. He's always been extreme since he was little. Can never sit still at meal times, is a picky eater. He was a little speech delayed, but we figured it was due to the constant ear infections from 8 mo-13 mo (finally had tubes placed). He climbs and jumps and runs constantly. We just got a 4 mo old dog, and he's always grabbing and dragging, petting rough, can never sit still and be calm to pet. He IS a sweet, loving boy. But he's also so wild that sometimes it's not worth doing something because somehow he will make the experience less fun. I know that sounds terrible, but both my husband and I are at our wit's end. My MIL rised four boys, and she is constantly saying she's never seen such a 'wild' child before. 

I did send an email to his pediatrician this morning asking for a referral to a child psychologist, just to see. And get parenting classes so I can better deal with my own frustration towards parenting him. I can give more example as well, if it helps."
Cat_Proxy	2021-04-25 14:37:29+00:00	"I think my husband doesn't enjoy being a father, and I'm not sure how to help him."	"Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?

Our son is 22 months. He got diagnosed with autism at 19 months (yes, it's early diagnosis, I'm not going into it because it's not relevant here, please don't question my doctor's decision, thank you). With the pandemic, we are on waitlists to get him therapies and into nursery school (which is currently closed), so we basically have him at home 24/7. He does speech therapy once a week for 30 minutes. The only person who comes to help is my MIL. She will babysit sometimes. It's more of a help for me than for my husband. He works from home. I'm the SAHM.

But yeah he's just not been himself. We've had divorce talks several times. I got him to attend couple's counseling with me. It feels like it's not helping. Once in a while, he starts to open up, and then he shuts down again so quickly that I only get a little bit of information. He says he's tired all the time. I think the responsibilities of our son is wearing him down, especially now with the diagnosis. Our son still wakes up a lot at night, and he's up at 6 am every day (which I think is pretty decent; it used to be 5 am before the time change!), but it kills my husband. Letting him sleep in does nothing, because he can't fall back asleep now. He wakes up at night and can't get back to sleep. He has stopped eating breakfast, says he has no appetite. I have begged him to talk to the doctor or a therapist, but he won't do it. It's been 6+ months of this, and he's just not making any effort. He's floating through our lives.

It's really sad. He had one day last weekend where he was laughing and happy and playing, and he seemed to be in such a good mood, it reminded me of what we are missing out on. Then he was back to his normal self the next day. On his phone every chance he gets. Tired. Lifeless. I can buy him free time, and it doesn't seem to make any difference. He said he didn't think this was going to be our lives with a kid, and I asked him, what did you think it was going to be? He said not this. He thought our son would be on a schedule, sleeping, going out often to grandma's house or daycare or whatever. Pandemic has really screwed everything up. He used to do soccer every week, and he hasn't been able to do that. He used to see his coworkers in-person, he hasn't done that (he started a new job right when pandemic started and has never been in the office). He used to go out once a month to D&amp;D, to a pub to see his former co-workers, etc. He can't do any of those things.

Am I stuck just waiting it out and hoping things get better after the pandemic? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? I keep telling him things will get better, but he doesn't believe me, and I don't know what to do. I hate seeing him like this."

The children know each other and are friends.

So I’m trying to plan fun days out and would like some ideas that would be fun for every child (the ages are quite spread out)(I’m basically trying to be the favourite godfather, we have another friend, but I’m going on a tangent now). 

And I’d like to know if there will be any difficulties I may overlook (apart from losing a child and breaking up fights). I’m supposed to put them all to bed, feed them, make sure they’re clean, the whole shabang

Here are the ages - Family 1:
1. Girl, age 3
2. Boy, age 5
3. Girl, age 8
4. Boy, age 9

Family 2:
1. Girl, age 5

IsEneff	2021-04-25 14:08:45+00:00	Should I care?	"TL:DR my sister is upset because I’ve asked to not have a graduation party the exact same weekend as my child’s graduation week. Mostly she’s upset because her child is also graduating and we aren’t going to “celebrate together.” Am I the bad guy?


Here the situation. I rarely talk to my sister, mostly on holidays when we go to my mothers house together. On Easter, my mother was in a mood and straight out told my daughter to plan for a date and time where she (my mom) could plan a graduation party. This is so my mother’s two oldest grandchildren can be celebrated at the same time despite the fact that the two grandkids have literally no relationship with one another. 

Further context: my mother and her siblings are very close. Growing up, my cousins were like siblings to me where some of them came to live with us off and on and various aunts/uncles have lived with us for long periods as well. So my mine is always trying to recreate her relationship with her siblings between my sister and me. After I graduated, I moved out of state to experience life on my own. Four years later I moved back and stayed with my parents for about a year until I got a place on my own with my then girlfriend and now wife. My sister and I were close, but as our directions in life changed we didn’t maintain a relationship. Her oldest is the same age as my oldest. My mom being a practical woman had joint baby showers. That was really awkward as many of our friends showed up lavishing us with gifts while very few showed for my sister. This is when I start to feel a little guilty. 

18 years later, my sister has had her ups and downs, mostly downs. She is divorced. She has chosen a career path that suits her antisocial behavior (cleaning buildings) and that doesn’t get a lot of income. I on the other hand have been driven to improve myself and while by no means rich, I’d qualify as lower middle class. This again makes me feel guilty for being successful and motivated while my sister struggles to pay bills and make ends meet. 

4 years ago, I told my oldest that we would take her to Disney World as a graduation gift. We’ve been putting small amounts of money aside and planning this for several years. This has drawn criticism from my mother who feels the money would be better spent on tuition. I also feel this is met with jealousy from my sister who hasn’t said anything directly but takes a very passive aggressive stance on these things. On Easter, my sister is berating her child with comments about going to graduation, attending the graduation party, and going to college (all of which her child doesn’t want to do). My mom pins down a date and time for graduation party the Saturday after graduation. We tentatively agree, it will be May 22nd. 

This week the school released the graduation schedule: Senior Breakfast, graduation rehearsal, graduation at a football stadium, project graduation. My wife and I begin to talk about pros and cons of doing a graduation party for my daughter both for her sake (busy schedule and almost no sleep) as well as considering that we are saving all of our extra cash for the trip to Disney 10 days later, as well as the risk of exposing us to the current pandemic from the hordes of family being packed into a house that can’t fit that many people in the same timeframe before our trip. 

And, to be clear, I recognize there is risk in taking my children to a crowded place like Disney. However, if we catch illness days before the trip that will make the trip miserable. 

This week, My sister texts all of us and asks what time the party will be. I ask if there is a way to consider moving it to after our Vacation. She says the weekend we recommended is her birthday weekend and that won’t work for her. I mention that we will be exhausted from two solid days of graduation events and cash poor since we are saving for vacation. She counters with her former in-laws coming from California (whom I’ve never met) to celebrate with our family. I reply that we can go, but that I won’t have the time or money to contribute for the selected date and time so it’s just a show up and celebrate. Her final text was “Mom will have to decide what she wants to do.” 4 days later and my mother still hasn’t brought it up. 

Enter the feelings of guilt again. I get that my sister isn’t taking her child on a vacation. Frankly, the one time my sister and her kids were taken to Disney by my mother they were miserable. Second, the dates we picked for this trip were centered around my mother going with us and her taking PTO. So we changed the original dates we picked and booked non-refundable flights. Then a month ago my mother backed out because she decided it was too expensive. So the dates for the trip centered around my mother who is no longer going. 

My other frustration is that in all of this, no one has asked either child what they want (we have, my child doesn’t want to go to a party that weekend) and are literally throwing this party for themselves and not the kids. My guilt is that if we don’t go, my family will paint it as us being both selfish and inconsiderate. They will frame the story as us being the bad guys to the rest of my family and fail to share the realities of our situation or concerns. 

Now with that context: I struggle with clear boundaries between myself and my family. We have different values and I have built a life with my five kids and wife. This is THE LAST CHANCE that I will get to take my kids as children on a family vacation. And yet I feel guilty and full of shame for wanting to have something special just for them/her. Should I care or am I falling prey to my families guilt tripping?"

thelonegunman88	2021-04-25 12:52:19+00:00	Transition of life for a 4 year old	"Ok so my fiancé and I are close to closing on our house and we’re kinda trying to figure out what the best way or course of action we should take to start telling her 4yo about it. She was with us the entire time we were house shopping but now it’s the real deal. 

She sorta knows that we’re getting a house and that it’s going to be the three of us living there but as far as the depth of her understanding what that means,  it’s hard to say. One minute it sounds like she gets it and is even ok with it but the next it really seems like she forgot everything we tried explain to her. 

I plan on moving in first and then they’ll come into the picture after my fiancé and I are married, just something traditional her and I wanted to do. 

This is the thing, her daughter finally mentioned about all the animals she grew up with and why she wasn’t going to be able to take them with her (her and my fiancé both lived with her parents who have animals.) Long story short the only animal she could possibly take is her cat. I’m deathly allergic to cats 🤧 my fiancé at one point was like... well if she can’t bring her can’t then you’re gonna have not bring your dog (this wasn’t a tit for tat instance it was just a very superficial option in the moment)... and I’m just like, no not happening. I’m not allergic to dogs and he’s outside anyways. I’ve had my dog for almost 8-9 years now. But this isn’t about length of time though. 

At this point we’re assuming the cat might have to be the key to making the transition smoother and less cumbersome. But we’re also just assuming it will be. I believe there could be other ways of making this transition better but it’s gonna be reliant on her own resiliency and just talking her through the life and dynamic change and less about the cat.

Has anyone else experienced this and lived to tell the tale? Or am I going to have to live the rest of my life with an IV in my arm dripping me allergy medicine? 

Thanks guys"
furlesswookie	2021-04-25 12:26:45+00:00	Anyone have a suggestion for a GPS device for children for an upcoming camping trip?	"Over the past several years, we have made a tradition of meeting up with several friends and enjoying a week of tent camping in the mountains. There's  8 kids among the families, ranging in age from 3-12. The oldest kid normally brings  a watch with him that has GPS tracking and limited cell phone capability, giving him the dubious honor of being the point person when we need the kids to return from whatever adventure they're on. We just found out that that family will not be joining us this year, so now I'd like to get a watch for my kids (7 and 4) so that they can run around the campground as normal, but still be in contact with us back at basecamp.

Anyone have a good reccomendation for a waterproof watch with GPS and cellular connectivity that is good for young kids? I'm on AT&amp;T,  but can be flexible."
hayden44e	2021-04-25 11:45:06+00:00	Separation Anxiety and/or Clinginess	"Hi everyone! Looking for some advice:

My 13-month-old daughter is very clingy. This is nothing new; she’s always been very attached to my husband &amp; I. She will only play independently for very short bursts but even then, my husband or I have to be nearby. She is constantly needing our attention and/or physical touch. 

This isn’t necessarily an issue, since I am a SAHM. But here’s why I’m a little concerned about her level of clinginess:

I have read that there can be a generic component to separation anxiety. My husband lost his mother at a very young age and distinctly remembers the negative impact it had on him as a child. He was already very attached to his mom and losing her exacerbated his already abnormal levels of anxiety. He firmly believes our daughter has inherited those same feelings. 

Additionally, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder years ago. Which means biologically, she’s certainly predisposed to anxiety issues of some kind. 

Whether or not she has separation anxiety, I recognize that she has always been far more attached to us than my 7yo son was as an infant/baby/toddler. 

I accommodate her needs as best I can but I still worry whether I’m doing enough or even doing the right things at all. I want to encourage independence while also validating her insecurities. I know this might seem silly for such a young child, but I am desperate to do the best I can for her. 

If anyone has any advice or guidance in this area, I would greatly appreciate it."
nttdnbs	2021-04-25 11:25:15+00:00	Son is picking up an attitude problem from daycare	"My two year old is in an in-home daycare with 4 other kids. We’re not happy with the lady that does it as is and are on waitlists for literally everywhere else, but so far no luck. I’m just saying that ahead of time because this may be influencing how I‘m seeing this situation.

In the past two months my son has developed a major attitude problem. He’ll get into people’s faces, point his finger at them and go „QUIET, KID“ or go „PSSSHHHHHH“, interrupting them. He‘ll do this to get attention when his dad and I are talking, or when we ask him to do things or are reading the wrong book - anytime he wants us to shut up essentially. He’ll also talk to other kids on the playground like this and chastise random people for no reason whatsoever.

We do not use these words or this tone in our household. While it’s not swearing or anything this is just not how we speak to each other. Not to him, not between my husband and I or even anyone in our extended family, nor have I ever witnessed any friends do that. So he can’t have it from anywhere but daycare.

I don’t appreciate that he’s being spoken to that way but mainly I do not want him to adopt this kind of behaviour. We’ve tried ignoring it and, failing that, firmly telling him he is not to speak to X in that way, but it’s just getting worse. He says it constantly now. 

Is this me jumping into „b*tch eating crackers“ territory or am I right to be annoyed about this? How do I get him to quit?"
You_Are_Doing_Great	2021-04-25 11:22:56+00:00	Who can I get to watch my newborn with specific medical needs if my wife isn't able to?	"I work a full time job while my wife stays at home.  We just had a child a few weeks ago.  They were born with several medical issues that required a good two weeks in the NICU.  We were just able to get her home with a lot of homecare supplies.  She needs a feeding tube, a strict feeding schedule, as well as specific medicines once or twice a day.  My wife had a C Section, so is still in a lot of pain.  She also just went back to the hospital because of pain, and found out she has an infection.  I've had to take more time off work to help care for both of them.

I feel super guilty calling off work.  We are short staffed as is, so I feel like I'm putting a strain on the team.  I was lucky enough to have extra managers as coverage these past few days, but there would be some days where I am the only manager on the floor.  If I wasn't able to come in, I don't know what we could do. It would be nice to get some more stability in our lives.  Assuming my wife recovers and is able to take over being a stay at home mom, we would be fine.  But what happens if she can't for whatever reason?

I know how to take care of our child, and all the medicines and stuff I need to do.  It's not as easy as hiring a babysitter and telling them these specific instructions.  We also don't have any family in the area to help, nor do we have any neighbors or friends we would trust.  It looks as if the only options I have is to take off work, which isn't ideal.

So what are my options?  Do you think any old babysitter could do everything correctly?  What is our plan B?"
sharpietaster	2021-04-25 11:15:06+00:00	Why are the biggest mum shamers always mums themselves?	"Exactly the title really. So many mums are quick to judge you if you don’t do exactly as they do. It’s as if they forget how hard it is in the first few months, especially as a first time parent. We’re all just winging it. One mum on a mum advice group this morning told me I should look forward to my son dying. Words have a powerful impact, I wish we could all put ourselves in each others shoes once in a while and be a little more understanding."
feta_morgana	2021-04-25 11:15:03+00:00	A quick tip for healthier meals	"The daily cooking hassle with young children..you know what i mean.
If you have five extra minutes on your hand, prepare an easy salad dressing/viniagrette in a clean screw glas.

Vinegar/Oil/ a little sugar or honey/ half a tablespoon of mustard and a pinch of salt.
Shake it-Ready
It will stay good  in the fridge for two weeks.

For every quick lunch i just cut up some veggies or salad with a slicer and use this dressing.3 minutes max, and i manage to put a healthy side on the table with every dish."

My sister is doing everything she can to get her tested but we currently know nothing and I’m so worried about a tumour on her brain or ovaries.
I feel sick thinking about it :(

Has anyone delt with this?"
ikaroa1	2021-04-25 10:28:14+00:00	What are the rules at the playground?	"So today I took my kids to the park, there was 2  swing sets. 1 with one of those rope hammock swings and a baby swing, and on the other side a baby swing and a big kids swing in a set.

When we got there my 18 month old wanted to go on the swing so I put him in and started pushing him. He was maybe on it for 1 minute when another kid, maybe 2.5 came up and wanted to go on it. Her brother, maybe 12-13 went on the big swing and I kept pushing my baby on the baby swing as he had only just got on and was enjoying himself, the others ones at the other side were still empty but I couldn't see my other kids playing from there so I didn't move him.

Anyway, the mother of the kids came up and instead of asking if her kid could go on the swing or just waiting until it was free, she stood behind me whilst I was pushing my baby saying, ""I know it's unfair that this other child won't get off so you can go on the swing next to your brother."" She said it about 5 times loudly over the course of 2 minutes, so I turned to her and said, ""We will be off shortly, there's another free set over there though if you can't wait a minute."" 

My baby was having a great time and had been swinging for around 3 minutes or so when I started getting uncomfortable with this mum standing right behind me talking about us to her child so I started to wind him down to hop off and move on.

Once I got him off, her kid didn't even want to go on the baby swing and was screaming she wanted to be on the big swing, I took my baby over to the slide and next minute, she's there with her kid, encouraging them to climb up the slide whilst other kids are waiting their turn to come down, when it got to my sons turn to go down her kid started climbing up again, so I asked her to hop off so the kids could come down. The mum got crazy irate and started shouting about how the mums at the park were trying to ruin her kids day by not allowing her to have fun.

It got me thinking, what is playground etiquette? I usually just tell my kids to wait there turn patiently for the swings or whatever and if the slides etc are being used I tell them they aren't to climb up... am I OTT or being unfair?"
Vonnybon	2021-04-25 10:11:18+00:00	The right way to handle it when my toddler gets hurt	"My baby girl is 2. When she gets hurts (like trips and falls) I always rush to her immediately to console her. I say something like “oh no baby, ouch ouch, sorry sweetie”. Depending on how hurt I she is or how upset, I’ll pick her up and hold her until she’s okay. Kiss it better. 

My husband’s side of the family has a different approach. They basically tell me to leave her and not make a fuss. They tell her that if you’re not bleeding your fine. They do this with my niece and nephew too. 

They seem to imply I’m going to make overly sensitive by reacting every time she gets hurt even when it’s not that bad."
pixelvirus89	2021-04-25 10:01:36+00:00	2 year old sleep regression?	"My daughter is about 2 years and 2 months old. She has been a pretty amazing girl when it comes to going to bed. Just likes a little rock and a silly song before we put her down, maybe charge up her glow in the dark stars before we close the door. Well suddenly she doesn’t want any of it and refuses bed. Like scream and yelling “strawberry dog!” (A silly story character we made up that she loves). Tonight was the worst and I felt so defeated... is this a sleep regression? Or do you reckon she’s obsessing over this story character? Is there something we can do?"
icedzozo	2021-04-25 09:39:48+00:00	My toddler broke my nose	"Yes, that is right. My sweet little ray of sunshine 20 month old son managed to fracture my nasal bones after throwing himself backwards from standing up (he loves the bounce back from the couch), straight into my nose with the back of his head. There was blood, there was tears all from me). He escaped completely unscathed. I copped my first broken bone at the age of 27. 

I would absolutely love to hear of some other weird injuries other parents have experienced at the hands of their boisterous children! It’s been 5 days and now all I can do is laugh despite the pain."
Boc1992	2021-04-25 09:29:26+00:00	My 9 year old daughter is selfish and disrespectful - How do we change this behaviour?	"She is our only child and admittedly is very spoilt from the materialistic side of things. She has everything she wants, gadgets clothes, toys etc...

We are however quite strict with her in every other way. Bedtimes, homework and punishments are always stuck to and abided by. She knows if she steps out of line there will be punishments she hates (tech gone, grounded, earlier bedtime).

I notice this mostly when she is with her friends who are always polite to us and respectful... As I always was with my friends parents as a kid. But she will tell them they don't need to bother taking shoes off, or just to put the rubbish on the floor. It's just a general respect for the house and parents that I always seemed to have as a kid.

The main issue is that even at 9 years old she cannot share and will insist everything is not fair unless she is the center of attention. There is very little empathy for her friends and I'm scared as they get older they will realise this and not want to be around her anymore. 

I really sound like I'm complaining too much here, she is an incredibly smart hard working kid at school and is compassionate in other ways... But the lack of respect is driving us mad! Has anyone else in similar situations managed to change this behaviour?"
chairman95	2021-04-25 09:15:33+00:00	Is my sister being a terrible mom? Or am I just being terrible?	"Hi guys, so my sister had a baby, despite me telling her that her boyfriend was shady(he had a previous marriage to obtain a visa, had a baby with the woman and left, and suprise suprise, he did the same to my sister) so now I accepted the role of the father because I didn't want my nephew being in a horrible orphanage(it killed my mental health and shelved all my plans to be a livestream musical artist), the boy is now two years old and my sister (28) is lazy, the only thing she does in the house is give him a shower, feed him every 4 hours and clean the living room floors on occasion, I do the dishes, bathroom, take out garbage, clean the living room and as ridiculous as it sounds get things from cupboards for her all the time because she can't reach, and just the other day she went for a walk, left her kid upstairs and commanded me to bring him down, she normally does lazy things like leaving his soiled diapers on the living room floor for me to pick up and throw outside, but this was another level of laziness, and with that I'm dealing with my own terrible mental health, I'm a drummer and gamer , but fell out of love with it, I can't get the mental  strength to clean my room at 25 and me not able to find a job hiring a fresh college graduate at this time, I feel like I'm falling behind my age mates and this has made my mental health even worse, I just want advice and am I the bad guy in this?"
tarrpak	2021-04-25 08:44:02+00:00	"(M20) I'm terrified and very depressed as a new father, please help. (Long long post, I'm sorry.)"	"I had a difficult childhood; my father left my family when I was in 3rd grade and my mother was a heavy alcoholic. I was consistently neglected and ignored at home, never got home cooked dinners or birthday presents. My mom stayed drunk all day and night, so when she wasn't working she was passed out on the couch. My older sister ended up addicted to heroin, and my mom died of cancer when I was 17. I had a lot of trauma over the years that I won't bore you with, but this all led to a lot of mental illness.


A year after my mother died, I finally tried dating again due to loneliness. I met a girl off a dating app and we hooked up, and this somehow became a relationship. We didn't have much in common and weren't the best match in my eyes, but she was nice to me and treated me with love. 


This changed a month in, when her personality flipped. She became manipulative, vindictive, childish, and controlling. I won't get into details, but she is the most emotionally abusive/toxic person I've met. I stayed with her because I was scared of being alone, and she made me think that everything was my fault anyway. Not long after, she ended up pregnant.


I have never wanted children, I just wanted to exist in the background and be left alone. I'm very introverted and low energy, I don't enjoy socializing, I'm scared of commitment, I'm scared of family, I'm immature. All of my dreams are individualistic, and I am selfish. I only feel truly comfortable and safe when I'm alone.


I thought that once I saw my daughter, my perspective would change and I'd be filled with love and passion for fatherhood. However, she's now 2 months old and I feel no connection to her. I don't dislike her or blame her for my own problems, but my opinion on being a parent and my own happiness hasn't changed at all. 


I'm scared to have that much responsibility and impact. I know how much every little thing my parents did affected me, and the thought of someone else thinking of me in that way terrifies me. More importantly, I am not the type of person fit to be a father. My parents never parented me, so I don't know what to do or say. I don't even know how to act around kids/babies, they make me really nervous and uncomfortable. I'm just very mentally damaged, and unable to function emotionally.


Currently, I'm living with a friend, but he's moving away in 2 months. I'm from New Jersey and the cost of living here is ridiculous, so the only option I see is to move in with my girlfriend. To me, that sounds like hell. I have no career, no education; I'm living in a place I hate with a girl that makes me feel worthless. I have no family to support me, and no happy parts in my life.


While I have a sense of duty and pride to not be like my dad, I dread everything about my future and feel no connection to my daughter. I want to run away, but I know that I can't. Lately, I've been really considering suicide. Now would be the best time to do it, because she won't really have memories of me or the fact that I died.

I don't expect a solution, because the only solution to me would be adoption and that isn't possible. Life is just happening too fast, I thought I'd have more time to make mistakes and grow up. I just wanted a break. If anyone has any words of advice or consolement, please send them my way. 


Thanks"

"I ($18F) have been running this camp for members of my community for years. I raised the rates because I am older. My rate is $250 weekly from 9 am to 3 pm. $450 weekly for 2 siblings. I will be paying my coworker $17 an hour and paying myself around $30 hourly. I plan activities and engage with these kids, I also do accounting. I was criticized about the price but it is lower than most of the local summer camps. We know the kids really well and they love coming. As a parent do you think the price is fair? Please be honest, I’m open to criticism"
2pineapple7	2021-04-25 07:26:29+00:00	Neighbor kid kissed my son	"My son is 5, will be 6 in July. He hasn’t really had a lot of chance to interact with other kids much. He had leukemia when he was 2-3, so we didn’t go anywhere and he didn’t play with the neighbor kids due to his compromised immune system. He did go to preschool for almost a full year before covid hit, then we went back to isolation for the most part. Now that things are calming down where we live, we have let him start playing with the neighbor kids. The first day, last weekend, he played next door while I sat in my backyard and eavesdropped across the fence. I heard the other kids (3 girls, ages 6,7 and 10) going on about how adorable my son is. Didn’t think anything of it. When he came home he told me that each of the girls kissed him on the cheek and forehead. I told him they must think he’s really cute, but that I think he’s too young to be kissing girls; I also told him that if he doesn’t feel comfortable with them kissing him, he needs to make sure the girls know that it’s not okay to try to kiss him. I told him a peck on the cheek isn’t a big deal to me but they don’t need to be kissing any lips and he seemed to understand and agree with me, I think he was really shy and embarrassed about the whole thing. 
Today he played with them again, the same girls, and when he came home he told me that the 7 year old kept trying to kiss him on the lips. 
I’m sure it was meant more playfully and not in a more mature “girlfriend” kind of way, but I’m still not super comfortable with it. 
Personally, I feel like he’s way too young for that (and she is too) but I’m just not really sure what to think or do. 
My son understands that I don’t want him kissing anyone on the lips, and I don’t think he necessarily wants her to be kissing him anyway, but I also know he has been kept away from other kids from most of his life so he probably doesn’t know how to react to this kind of attention, and I’m sure he wouldn’t want to say or do anything to make them not want to play with him anymore. 
I guess I’m just wondering what to do about this, or if I should even do anything. Is this normal for that age group? Am I wrong to be uncomfortable with it? Do I need to talk to her, or her mom?"
Terr0rBytes	2021-04-25 07:22:56+00:00	Any advice on how to help articulate tight clothes	"I m(39) have a son m(7) and I'm hoping for any advice on what I can do to help assess whether clothes on him are hurting him or are just tight fitting.

Sorry I'm finding this hard to explain.

Swimming.

Trunks and goggles.

They should be snug, they should be tight, but they should not cut in.

We have the experience to know something may be uncomfortable as they are very tight fitting for a purpose but I can't tell, and neither of us are able articulate if they are just tight or if they are truly hurting him. To him they just hurt.

I can stretch the trunks while on him with my finger quite a way before the elastic stops. So to me this is fine. But to him they hurt.

Same with the goggles. They only don't hurt him, his words, when there is an obvious gap in the sides, negating the purpose of them.

Wanted to know if there is any advice others could give me on how to ask or how to better see and assess clothing on him."
kiolly22	2021-04-25 06:22:40+00:00	Will I love this one as much?	"I am currently 6 months pregnant with a baby girl. 9 years ago I had my beautiful boy, I loved him more than anything and he totally changed my life. Weve been through a lot together as a single parented family, moved together and created a home together. 

Well I met my new partner two years ago and never saw myself having anymore children. But a few accidents later and here I am 😊 I was so happy intially, all be it a bit anxious. But recently I've realised just how much will change for my 9yo and just how much I appreciate and love him. He is just the the most energetic, sweetest and kindest little soul. I'm worried I am not feeling that for this baby, and if I ever will? 

Did anyone else feel this way with their second? I feel so sad that my solo adventures with my first are coming to a close. I feel I will like this baby but perhaps not love her the same. I am trying to be as open and honest as I can here so please no nasty comments."
HowLovely23	2021-04-25 06:09:57+00:00	How to know what's normal for different ages?	"My daughter just turned 7 and I feel like a crappy mom lately.  I just realized, I don't really know this age and what to expect.  I worked at a daycare years ago, grew up watching my baby cousins and I have a degree in early childhood..

I felt like a rockstar mom from birth to about age 4.  But the last couple years, and especially now, I just don't know what's normal for her age, and what's not.  At 3, I knew tantrums were par for the course and I just went with it and felt confident in my parenting because I know toddlers act like crazy little dictators..  For the most part my daughter is a very good kid.  But she sometimes has the attitude of a teenager and still throws tantrums from time to time.  

I feel like I don't handle them well anymore because I don't know if she should be past this sort of thing, or if it's still totally normal.  She's my only, and most everyone I know has older kids.  I feel like I could deal with things better if I could say ok, I know this is normal and she's behaving exactly like a 7 year old...but I get so worked up and frustrated because I worry certain behaviors aren't normal for her age, and maybe I'm doing something wrong to contribute to the behavior.  

Is there a book or something to tell me this is how your kid will probably act at this age?  How does everyone handle behavior when you don't have experience with that age?"

MrsHarryJPotter	2021-04-25 05:27:13+00:00	Soft spot indent- help?!	My 8 month old is teething again and I’ve been having a hard time getting her to eat much. I breastfeed and offer her food every two hours but she doesn’t seem to want to eat much. She will usually eat a little here and there about 3-4 hours. I’ve been offering her water as it’s warmer out and don’t want her to get dehydrated. She snacks on yogurt bites and baby puffs. We we’re doing baby foods but she’s not interested in the mushy stuff so I’ve just been breastfeeding. I’m not sure what made me notice or how exactly but the last 2 weeks of so I’ve been feeling her soft spot and noticing it dips down when she hasn’t eaten. She doesn’t seem dehydrated but I always try to get her to eat right away. She has usually 5-6 wet diapers. I need to keep better track but I’m just worried. Is it normal for it to be slightly sunken in between feedings? Her hair is also longer and it might be making the dip seem more noticeable because it’s wavy. I plan to try to get her in the doctor but until I can ease my mind. Even after she eats a lot at bedtime or for naps it’s not as dipped down but i can tell it’s lower after she doesn’t eat much. I’ve also been waking her up from naps or getting her in the middle of the night when I know she will eat more just so I know she’s getting good feedings. Any advice is appreciated! FTM and I don’t want my baby to get dehydrated while teething and not very interested in eating much!
Unlikely-Book785	2021-04-25 04:44:50+00:00	Husband Hangs Out Late at Night	"I’m wondering whether it’s normal (or how normal) for a married man to go out late at night (like after 10 pm) to his friends’ places. My husband does this once in a while, not that often but not that rare either. Well he’s a social person and does have many friends, so I always let him meeting his friends all this time (except when it’s clearly not the right time). We’ve been married for 5 years and all this time I don’t overprotective at all to him, but since we have a toddler (an another one otw) I’m starting to wonder about this.

-treadlightly-	2021-04-25 04:00:47+00:00	Help me tech my son how to stand up against unwanted touch	"We live in Louisiana. People are very friendly and generally feel that you can walk by and touch children you don't know. This week while picking up food, a restaurant owner we'd never met walked by once and sort of rubbed my 6 year old son's head (think grabber type head massager) then did it again when he walked by again. I told my son it's ok if that made him uncomfortable, we wouldn't do that to someone else we don't know, and he shouldn't do it to us. I told him it would make me uncomfortable. But I didn't say anything to the man to stop him, so I want to walk it back and teach my son how to stand up for himself. And at the very least I want the words to say FOR him next time instead of just doing nothing.

Then, as it must've been a prime parenting day, I took him to see my grandmother and the caretaker that he had never met. The caretaker wanted a photo with him, and completely against everything I've taught him, I asked him to please do it instead of asking him if he wanted to/was comfortable doing it.

I just screwed up that day. I told him I messed up. He was clearly uncomfortable with both events. We have NEVER EVER encouraged hugs or anything with other Edpeople including family. As we leave it up to him and help him say no when he doesn't want to, he usually doesn't hug much of anyone but us (even pre COVID I mean).

I could use help teaching him and me the words to ask a strange adult to stop touching him. And welcome other words to teach him what I should've helped him say when the caretaker wanted a photo with him. It should be as simple as asking him if he wants to and helping him say no when he doesn't, I just completely screwed up. 

TL;DR: what should a child or parent say to an unknown adult that touches their child? How do you help your child say no to things like taking a photo with someone when they don't want to?"

We're very careful about what he watches and comes into contact with, though there is the preschool element outside of our control, and we have noticed him being introduced to concepts such as violence and what not by peers at the school.  He's very happy at the school, to the point that he often doesn't want to leave when we go to pick him up.

Catzy94	2021-04-25 03:31:35+00:00	Formula question- seeing mixed answers	"I know to always throw away formula after two hours and never reuse formula that’s touched baby’s lips. But, can untouched formula be used after mixing if refrigerated?

The exact scenario is this- kiddo is four months old, mostly formula fed. He ate earlier and fell asleep in his crib. He woke up, clearly a hungry cry so I fed him a little 60ml bottle. He didn’t fall asleep so I figured I’d make another 120ml bottle. By the time I finished, he was out. So, the bottle never touched his lips and was just made. Fiancée suggested putting it in the fridge since he didn’t touch it. Maybe five minutes between making it and putting it in the fridge.

When we wake up in the morning, can I warm the bottle and give it to him? How do I do that? Do I treat it like a normal bottle? Shake it before warming or after? I really don’t want to waste formula if I don’t have to. It gets so expensive!

Thanks in advance!"

brkrpaunch	2021-04-25 01:57:58+00:00	No children here: Question about my own upbringing and my Dad	"TLDR:  How should my Dad have responded when a youth coach neglected the wellbeing of a child?

Effectively I understand how he reacted: He was always visibly and audibly upset.  

I played youth soccer in my town frequently growing up.  One season when I was about 9 or 10 years old I was on a team that practiced in a more remote part of town.  My dad was a teacher and worked somewhat later.  My mom was a nurse and frequently worked nights.  I think this was maybe 1994 or so.

Sometimes after practice, I remember this particular coach just sort of clocking out and taking off with his son right at 6 or 7 PM or whenever practice ended.  

I know for a fact my Dad had told this guy ""Look, there's sometimes when I can get there right when practice ends.  But I will never be more than 10 or 15 minutes beyond that so just hang tight, please.""

But the coach never did.  Like sometimes he might have waited 5 minutes.

Then, when my dad would roll up, to find me and (sometimes) a couple other kids hanging by themselves in the dark, around these soccer fields.  He would get about as mad and as irritated and as perturbed as I'd be able to see from him.

But he'd tell me to be more assertive, as if I'm supposed to supervise the coach.  Or he'd question me about what happened leading up to the coach's departure.

I presume he didn't pull me off that soccer team because he didn't want to punish me for what was the neglectful coaches fault.  I also presume he called the coach to chew him out or reinforce his request to look out for the wellbeing of all the kids.  But what is the correct response here.  I'm just curious about what parents would do."

He has all the help he needs but still wont do the work. He has to be yelled at to even start home work. Im a single dad me and my ex are devirsed, I this past week grounded him for 3 weeks for these failed classes. My ex on the other all they did was yell at him, but I know it didn't work. This happens all the time he does fine then wont focus. My youngest does great in school no issues there. My question is we found out after years who my 15 year Olds dad was. Lets say he had demons, could that be why hes acting this way was he effected what his real dad was doing. Because he doesn't act like me, an I get no help from his mom when I ground him. She tells me i have no right to ground him. Any advice ?

My mom (72) has been battling stage iv cancer for five years. It recently progressed significantly and she’s near her very end. I live across the country from her. Literally I’m on the west coast, she’s on the east coast. 

I am married with a four year old. My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer about six months ago. 

In the last month, my mom has been hospitalized 3 times. I’ve flown back and forth across the country four round trips (8 times in three weeks). 

This last time, I got a call with my dad sobbing and telling me she’s about to go. My brother, who is a 40 year old narcissist and childless that lives at home, told me that I need to come home and nothing else matters (alluding to my wife’s cancer). He’s said some other awful things too, basically saying he doesn’t care about her cancer, but that’s for another therapy session. 

I need advice. How do I navigate this situation?? In my heart I feel like I know the answer—prioritize my wife and child first and foremost, and come when it really is a dire situation. I already said goodbye to my mom and feel at peace with it. 

I just can’t shake this guilt. Damned if I do damned if I don’t. But really damned if I don’t take care of my daughter and wife during her treatment. Right??

My dad is not self sufficient. I know that if I choose my wife and daughter my brother will use it against me and will tell my dad that I’m a bad son who failed his moral obligation. By the way my dad does not know about my wife’s cancer. 

Any thoughts from this group?? I feel like I know that being a father is the most important priority. I suppose I’m looking for confirmation of it."

Our two-year-old is waking up super early every morning--around 5 am. I feel we have tried a variety of stuff, but no matter what, she still wakes up at that time. 

* Her bedtime was at 6:30p, so we moved it to 7p.
* We have moved to one nap per day
* She has a weighted blanket
* Sound machine her whole life
* Blackout curtains (though she woke up early before it was light in her room)

We have a 4-year-old with a bed right next to her room, so while we normally would let her cry it out, we don't want to wake her sister. This is her first time with sleep issues. She was crushing the sleep from 6:30 pm-7 am for a long time so we are not sure what's going on. First sleep regression?

This might be a long shot but I’ve always been very curious.

I’ve had undiagnosed chronic neck for 10 years. Daily pain, doctors have sent me down worm holes, no relief but I continue to try and find a cause/solution. Anyway, I have a 6 month old baby and my neck pain was very low almost the entire duration of my pregnancy. 

I’ve heard some theories about the relaxin hormone but I’m curious if anyone else has heard of or experienced this? There were no other correlations other than being pregnant (ie my exercise, lifestyle, eating habits, no medications, etc all stayed the same). 

Thank you!"
Tnt540	2021-04-24 23:59:22+00:00	Advice to help my 20 month old talk more	"Hello! SAHD here. I’m looking for things to help get my daughter talking more. She currently only says around 15/20 words. (Mama/dada/hi/baba/dog/ball/(dogs name) etc. I think COVID lockdowns in addition to my wife and I living 500 miles away from family are the biggest contributors to her lack of speech. We don’t have many friends here so we stay at home quite a bit. I’ve admittedly slacked on the book reading a bit because she doesn’t seem as interested in them anymore. She’d rather play with other things, like her building blocks. She has previously been ahead on other milestones, like crawling and walking. I know all babies are different and speech usually doesn’t become a big issue until about 2 years, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m failing her as a parent in this particular area. I already ask her to say things as we interact with them (things like spoon, door, shirt, etc) and sometimes she’ll make an attempt at saying them but only really pronounce the first letter of the word. Other times she won’t try at all. 

Any advice would be appreciated."

We got about 5 minutes in before she said her belly hurt, so we tried turning on music and having her sing, having her name car colors, and sip some water. Nothing stopped the puke erupting from her like a little volcano. Also as a side note she had lunch 2 hours prior to leaving and a few crackers 30 minutes before leaving (we thought it would help settle her tummy)

hoopahDrivesThaBoat	2021-04-24 23:04:51+00:00	2 year old whiniest baby ever	"Honestly... I WANT to love my kid more than oxygen... but for the most part I hate being around her. I hate saying it to a boatload of strangers... but much better than to my wife.

She had colic for the 14 months. It was awful. Maybe the worst year in my life. Since then she’s been better. Has plenty of time where she is happy (if she is watching TV, eaten frozen chicken Nuggets, or some other terrible thing we shouldn’t give her but we’re just too tired).. but she also cries a lot more than I’ve ever heard of.

Cries at bedtime. Cries when she wakes up. Cries on the way to daycare. Cries when she doesn’t get what she wants. Cries when she gets what she wants. Cries if we don’t change the channel to exactly what she wants. Cries when it’s time for a bath. Cries when it’s time to get out of the bath. Cries when it’s time to get dressed. Cries when it’s time to get undressed. I want to say that in a 12 hour day she probably is actively making some crying or whining noise for no reason for maybe 6 of those hours. 

Hoping someone can share stories of how, even at two, they know of a ton of kids that are just unspeakably unhappy half or more of the time. I want this to be normal and I want to figure out how to be OK with it so I can just love my kid instead of love and absolutely resent her."

MinuteJuice	2021-04-24 22:19:23+00:00	"My son (15) is turning into a controlling boyfriend, can I stop it?"	"Hi!
So my son(15) has his first girlfriend and they’re pretty serious about each other (going out for 6 months). It’s clear they are very much in love and it’s mostly super cute. She stays with us most of the time because she has a difficult family life.

However, I‘m noticing some increasingly controlling and disrespectful behavior from him towards his gf. He always puts his needs before hers (e.g. she‘s hungry and he ii to watch TV so he‘ll tell her „you can eat after this movie“), tells her she‘s not allowed to eat meat anymore (he‘s a vegetarian), decides when to go to sleep, eat etc. I told him in her presence that he can’t decide such things for her and that her opinions matter as much as his but I can’t seem to get through. I told them what she eats is her decision but she said she didn’t want to anger him so she complies with what he says. 🚩 🚩
He also always wants her full attention even when he’s doing something else (like gaming) and is angry at her when she does something else like look at her phone while he‘s busy. He even takes away her phone but he can look at his own phone whenever he wants.

My husband and me have a great relationship, we respect each other tremendously, rarely fight and this is just not what we are showing him. If my husband treated me like that I’d be gone in the blink of an eye. We thought teaching him about relationships by example would be enough to make a decent partner of him but I‘m really really worried that he‘s becoming a toxic and controlling partner to the poor girl. I already told her that she shouldn’t let him control her and her opinion matters as much as his and she just said something like „well, I do things to keep him happy, it’s ok.“. She also now does his household chores. I told them she didn’t have to and she said „it’s ok, I don‘t mind“ while he said something like „well if she doesn’t mind it and I do, why should I do it?“ 😩

How do we get through to him? I asked my husband to talk to him 1-on-1 to give him a male perspective. Or do we just let them figure it out themselves?

Btw she’s not meek even if it sounds like it here and sometimes does talk back to him which we encourage, but we think she’s afraid to lose him so she complies a lot. They also fight a lot but he always „wins“ because he’s the most stubborn person I know and never backs down."

ittybittymomma	2021-04-24 21:28:28+00:00	Toddler being a bit much. I’m at my wits end.	"Hi everyone. I could use either advice or encouragement tbh, because I don’t have anyone else I can turn to for it. 

My 3 year old is going to be the death of me. She’s blind, just to preface this. So, she develops a bit differently or later with some things. I’ve kept that in mind her whole life and been as patient as I can manage, which has become difficult lately. 

She has always had drinking issues and feeding issues. The drinking issues are the problem I’m having today. That’s why I’m in tears. And before anyone suggests talking to her ped or another dr, she has a team of them who are all well aware of her issues. She just doesn’t drink on her own. Doesn’t lack the ability, just outright refuses to. I know there’s a saying “if they’re really thirsty/hungry, they’ll drink/eat”. Yeah, we’ll, I’ve found that’s not true at all. If I don’t somehow get water into her, she won’t drink at all. I’ve left cups all over the house in her common spots, I’ve handed them to her directly, I’ve tried fun cups, I’ve tried regular open cups, I’ve tried despairing syringing water into her mouth. Lately, she just spits it out or blows bubbles. I try to curb this by giving her special bubble blowing time, where she’s free to blow bubbles in a big bowl of water. It’s not working. I’ve gotten water all over her, my floor and me. She just plain spits it all over herself and doesn’t care. She laughs. Nothing I say or do is making it better. Then if I get more firm (without raising my voice), she shouts or hits. I firmly hit gently stop her and tell her she’s being too loud. But she just doesn’t listen. It’s almost like she can’t hear me but her ears work perfectly.

I feel like I’ve failed as a mother. She used to have a tube...and I worry if I fail any longer that she’ll have to get it again. When she’s perfectly capable of drinking, because she’ll do it at night when she’s asleep. I’ve just broken down sobbing after the fourth time of getting wet just today. I can’t hold it in anymore. If there’s anyone out there who has lived something close to similar, can I get a shoutout? I feel like I’m alone."
halfsassit	2021-04-24 21:03:57+00:00	8F Daughter refuses to compromise and has massive tantrums about it	"I'm losing my mind here. My daughter has recently decided that she'd rather have screaming tantrums than compromise. Several times a week, she won't get her way and instead of picking from one of several other good options, she ignores all our warnings about whining and arguing and will not let go of wanting to do whatever it is she wanted to do in the first place. We explain our reasoning for why she can't do the thing and offer at least two other choices (always things she likes). She won't hear of it. She comes up with solutions so that she can get her way, usually solutions that don't work. We explain again the reasoning and offer other choices. She starts crying and digging her heels in worse, so we offer one good choice and one bad choice (timeout in her room, often the loss of electronics or playing outside). She digs her heels in more, and so she loses her choices and goes to her room until she can calm down. She scream-cries in her room, which she knows isn't okay since we have thin floors and lots of neighbors who don't want to hear this. (We have told her nine million times that it's okay to cry when you're upset, but it is not okay to scream. Screaming is for emergencies.) Eventually she calms down and comes out all tearful and asks again for the thing we initially said no to, and then we repeat the cycle at least once more, and usually by the end of this she's lost a privilege or two because she refuses to listen. We're at the end of our ropes, and I feel like we're doing all the right things in this situation and nothing is helping. I've been going out of my way to spend more time with her, stay calm when things get heated, really listen to what she's saying instead of brushing her off, etc. It often gets dragged out for an hour or two, and all her sense goes out of her brain. We frequently point out that she's choosing to be sad by focusing on how upset she is about not getting the one things she wants instead of choosing something else that she likes and being at least mostly happy. We can't get through to her that we can't make her be happy and she can't have whatever she wants all the time, which is not new. I'm absolutely baffled that she'd actively choose to lose things she loves and spend time in her room crying than compromise and go with a second or third choice that wouldn't ruin everybody's day, especially hers. If this were 6-8 months ago, I'd chalk it up to all the stress of online school and being stuck inside, but she's back to in-person school (which she's been looking forward to since last March) and the weather is nice so she's been playing outside every single day. I don't know what to do. Please help!"

"After weeks of crying and fussing and doctors/midwives telling me to ""look for tired signs"" or ""just feed her more"", we finally have a diagnosis for terrible reflux and a speech pathologist appointment for sucking and swallowing issues. Her sleeping and eating is manageable at night, but she can be a tiny demon during the day, not sleeping for up to 7 hrs sometimes. Rather than demand feeding we are now on a strict 3-4 hourly feed scheduale and needs to be held upright 30 min after eating. 

We are also trying to be mindful of our own mental health and there is a band playing in the city our parents live in this coming weekend. We were going to drop her off late arvo and aim to pick her up by 11. It would be the first time we'd be away from her for more than an hour since birth (she's 3 months old) and we were keen for some us time. She also sleeps and dream feeds from around 7pm-7am, so theorically not too much work for grandparents to look after. They are still keen to look after her too and don't need to give her any medication. 

My concern is I'm feeling guilty about leaving her so soon after figuring out her issue and leaving hospital. I'm also worried now about any big changes to routine will unsettle her and that grandparents won't do it the ""right"" way, i.e. ""my way"" (I know right...eyeroll at myself).

My son absolutely has been throwing a fit if diaper changes go outside of his normal routine like if he poops and needs an extra diaper in the morning or even sometimes when he doesn’t feel like it. It’s getting ridiculous as I am waiting around or taking toys away for what seems like an hour before I have to actually force him/hold him down while he’s kicking and crying. It breaks my heart and prevents us from doing so many fun activities because I’m trying to be patient waiting for him to come to me after he poops “and if you come and get a diaper we can go outside etc” but he just doesn’t care and will keep playing around me. Crazy stubborn child (no idea where it comes from lol) but any tips or ideas? Is it time to potty train?

My husband and I are grieving our son, Benjamin (we got to meet/hold him) and I am still recovering physically from a hemi-hysterectomy. We also have a 3.5yo daughter who has always been the light of my life. Now after losing my son even the simplest parenting task seems impossible. She knows basic information about what happened but her understanding is limited. She still needs help wiping, getting food, needs a playmate, etc. and it just seems impossible when I feel so low. 

I just keep picturing how great of a big sister she was going to be in September and now that dream is gone. We do plan on trying again at end of summer but now that I only have one tube it may affect my fertility (along with my uterine issue). I feel like the only way I’ll be happy again is when I have another baby and I feel awful I’m having these feelings when I have my daughter."

Don’t know which features will matter to us over the next 3-5 years (currently have an 8 month old). Any advice on car features that have made your family life easier/more enjoyable?
abysmalyssa	2021-04-24 18:33:42+00:00	In-laws just don't care	"So I've been with my husband for almost 10 years.  We have 3 kids: 10f, 8m, and 6m.  In all these years together my parents have been very involved grandparents.  My dad is an amazing grandpa and even though I thought my mom was the best growing up, she's an even better grandma.  My parents' house is like a second home to my kids and I love that they are so close.  

My husband's parents couldn't be any more opposite.  They weren't very attentive parents according to my husband so it makes sense that they wouldn't change with kids.  My kids see them maybe once a month and that's if there's some other family thing going on like a holiday get together.  When i worked and needed a sitter on a rare occasion, his parents were never available and I got every excuse in the book.  They just never seem to care if they see the kids or not.

What irks me though, is that my husband's sister has a 4yo and his mom is always watching her kid.  She posts pics of them together on Facebook.  My SIL has split custody with the kid's dad so she only has him for half of the month but you'd better believe my MIL soaks up every bit of him that she can.  What sucks is now that my kids are getting older, they're starting to notice.  My daughter was in dance for about 5 years and my MIL only ever went to maybe 2 performances.  My in-laws have missed birthdays and other such things for my kids.  But you'd better believe they wouldn't miss anything for my nephew.

I don't even know what I want out of posting this.  I guess to get it off my chest?  I've talked to my husband about it but he doesn't like opening up about hard feelings.  He rarely reaches out to them anymore and since he doesn't, he rarely ever hears from them.  I just don't get how people couldn't care about family because mine is so close."

It’s more cooing and ahhing still. I hear some R’s and M’s sometimes—but I heard or thought there should be more consonant sounds and more of them strung together at this point. 

Should she be farther than she is speech-wise or is she okay? Was there anything that you did to really help get your baby to start babbling more?

I talk/narrate what I’m doing and I sing to her and we read books more now than ever. I ask her questions and mimic the sounds that she does make. But I still wonder if I should be doing more or if I’m lacking somewhere"
SnickersDadBot	2021-04-24 16:45:10+00:00	"How will we deal with the ""end"" of the pandemic?"	"TL;DR: My wife and I will be fully vaccinated in a couple of weeks, but I don't know how much we should relax and allow our kids to socialize if they themselves won't be able to get vaccinated for ages. I also don't know how to help the kids transition back into having a pre-pandemic social life, especially my 3 year old, who missed out on a lot of learning opportunities this past year. 

**I highlighted the important stuff because I know it's a massive wall of text.**

Hi. **I have 4 kids, ages 15, 12, 10, and 3. We've all been staying home for 13 months.** Thankfully, our country is making a lot of progress with the vaccination campaign. **I'll be getting my first shot at 5pm today, and my wife will get hers on Thursday**, so we're now looking at a future where we're both vaccinated.

The thing is, **I'm not sure what we can start doing again after we've gotten both shots, because of course our kids aren't vaccinated, and they probably won't be for a very long time (especially the younger 2)**. Now I know that the risk is much lower for kids, but a) there's still a risk, especially for Long Covid, and b) I don't want them running around infecting a bunch of other people, especially when variants are a thing.

There's a couple of other things we'll definitely do, for example visiting grandparents (and relatives in general). We've basically only done video chats since the start of the pandemic, but since my mom and my wife's parents are fully vaccinated themselves, we feel like it's fine.

**We want to at least expand our (and our kids') bubble a little bit, but we don't know how much of it is safe and where to draw the line. The kids have had masked play dates with one specific friend each, but I don't know how much we should allow now, and under what conditions.** Both of my girls (15 and 10) eventually want to have a party with friends to make up for their Covid birthdays, but we feel like that's way too early.

Safety issues aside, even if the kids were fully vaccinated today, **I'd have no idea how our family would adjust to things going back to ""normal"". Since all of my kids only have one friend to hang out with in person, they've really only been able to develop their friendships with that friend.** Of course that doesn't mean they aren't friends with the others anymore, but I feel like it will be hard for them to find their way back into a group and catch up with the others. Especially since some of their friends have had some hard feelings about them choosing a different friend as the one to hang out with during the pandemic (which I understand, it sucks feeling left out). **It'll be a major adjustment period, especially for my 10 year old, who's already going through some changes, and friendships are super difficult to navigate at that age.**

I mainly worry about my boys, though. **My 12 year old isn't super outgoing, and while he's very close with his best friend now, I don't want him to rely on only one friend throughout his teenage years. Of course we won't know how much this covid/social distancing stuff has affected him until things truly go back to normal, but I've got some reasons to assume he'll be more anxious about it and have a harder time trying to make friends**. Does anyone else have a kid who's similar to him? **How are you planning on making things easier and helping them with this kind of stuff?**

**My little one (he will be 4 in June) obviously hasn't had the time to learn how to play with kids his age. He plays with his siblings and with his friend (who's 6, though**, so not at the same developmental level), but we were originally planning to send him to pre-school in the fall of 2020, **so that he could learn how to really play with kids who are at the same level of verbal and social development as him. I'm kinda worried about what will happen when we do try to let him play with a bunch of other toddlers again. He can get pretty frustrated when things don't go his way in a game, and I feel like it'll be worse when he plays with kids his age, rather than kids who are way older, can express themselves verbally, and help him talk things through.** I don't want him to get frustrated and hit the other kids at pre-school, throw toys, etc. **Basically, I don't know how to make up for the year of social development that he missed.** Thankfully he at least doesn't seem to be afraid of other kids or anything like that (he's dying to play with the neighbor kids).

**Another thing is that my oldest daughter (15) will most likely have to go back to in-person school soon.** The other kids are home-schooled, but she's in distance learning (long story), and they're basically talking about scrapping the distance learning program entirely and going back to full in-person learning (I know, we are pretty lucky that they held out for that long in the first place, a lot of districts went back to in-person learning like a year ago). I hope they at least wait till the school year is over, and things will probably look a lot different in late August, but **I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be with her going back in person at this point.**

What are you guys' thoughts? I know, many people probably won't agree with our decision to go to this extreme with social distancing in the first place. **Those who did something similar, how do you decide when / how much to relax, and how will you help your kids make up for what they missed out on socially, once this pandemic is officially a thing of the past?**"

He works 8 hours for 7 days and get $15 per hour (gets pay weekly). We don’t have big bills because we live with his parents and don’t have a new car too. Since his mother is remodeling the inside the house I am staying with family with my daughter and he sleeps in the motel with his brother or with family. Every time I told him I need money for pullups and food for our child he doesn’t give me money to support and waits until the last minute. Almost 2 weeks ago he gave me $20 now this week he wants to give $10. I ask where all the money he make 3 weeks of work went he gets offended and tell that I shouldn’t worry about it and his mother is on this side. I told him we have a child.
sunset2020	2021-04-24 16:02:24+00:00	Help. I just can't handle my 8yo anymore.	"TW: suicide. I straight up don't know what to do with my almost 8 year old. His behavior is triggering me in ways that give me suicidal ideations and I just straight up don't know what to fucking do.

For context my kid has something. Don't know what. Maybe anxiety, maybe depression, maybe OCD, who fucking knows? Apparently you can't officially diagnose kids this young. He was in therapy for a year, she talked with him and taught him coping skills (that he rarely used) and it didn't help. He's not violent or aggressive at all, he's just insanely whiny and cries about every fucking little thing all the fucking time. Okay not ALL the time. His case of idk-what-the-fuck-ever-it-is isn't even close to what most parents have to deal with in their kids. But I literally cannot deal with it anymore and have had literal thoughts of suicide. 

My husband is much better with him than me and very supportive of me, but I'm primary caregiver. I work part-time on weekends but am looking for a full-time job literally just so I am not around him the entire day. His school is in person for 2 hours in the morning. We also have a 3 year old.

There are no resources. Like what am I supposed to do? Apart from admitting myself into a fucking hospital (which I feel would be a colossal waste of everyone's time and valuable resources) what do I do? I've talked to his doctors, a developmental pediatrician is supposed to be getting back to us and hasn't yet. But even then it's like ""Ya he fucking whines and loses his shit over everything,"" like what's the doc supposed to do with that? He's not ""extreme"" enough to be taken seriously I feel like, and I also feel like the biggest issue is me and how it triggers me to no end and I can't fucking handle it. (I am on an SSRI for depression.) 

I just don't know what to do."

He doesn’t talk yet so I’ve been hesitant on starting the process but he does show he understands when we speak to him. 

We just introduced the training potty to my son last night. We unboxed it and let him play around with it. This morning, he grabbed it from the bathroom. So I took his diaper off to let him practice sitting on it. But he had a huge tantrum once I tried to put the diaper back on. Should I just start potty training him since he’s not too fond of his diaper anymore? Or should I wait until he starts talking?"
McClippz	2021-04-24 15:38:19+00:00	Child Will Not Sleep.	"Hello parents ,

My Wife (28) and myself (29) are literally hanging on by a thread . Our youngest of two children (3) will not sleep . Not only will she not sleep through the night , but when she does fall asleep every hour she wakes up for at least 20 minutes to scream for someone to go in there.

When I try as the father to go in there , she screams louder and will only excite herself more until Mom comes in there. I feel so bad for my wife getting roughly around 4 hours of sleep a night according to her watch .

We have brought this up to multiple doctors, and even had a sleep study done . But to no avail we have had zero luck , most of them shrugging us of telling us that her breastfeeding at night is the only reason for her lack of sleep. 

We have looked into multiple recourses and continue to use practices that were suggested ..... we have a nighttime routine , we have a dark room , a white noise machine , we provide night lights . We have tried bed early and later  and even melatonin . We really are at the ends of our ropes and struggling .

For the last week as an example she woke up at 2 am and stayed awake until 7 am. Refusing to go back to sleep , finally so dead tired took a 30 minute nap , and is now awake again.... but dead tired 

The lack of sleep is effecting her behavior as she gets unbelievably aggressive when she is tired (which is 90% of the time) . She refuses to nap and becomes combative , violent and will not listen .

Please if you have any advice I would love to hear it . 
TIA

Tldr: Child won’t sleep , is aggressive , have asked for medical help but it’s not working ."

We baby proofed the drawers and cupboards and outlets and corners but she can reach things several inches onto the counters and tables, and open any door the hasn't latched fully be grabbing the door handle (old building). She can nearly do a pull up so I've found her on chests, the coffee table, and even in one of the cat hammocks. Now she's figured out how to use things to help her climb the few things she can't. Yesterday see used a laundry basket to climb into the hamper and then to the dresser. The day before she used a stereo speaker to climb onto the entertainment center. Do you just let them climb? Do you hope you don't find them on the fridge snacking on the chips? I don't want her to think she's bad, in the right setting all her qualities are great, but I don't want her to end up in the ER either and I can't watch her every moment of every day. Anyone else have a kiddo like this? What did you do?

P.s. we tried a playpen and she just screamed and pushed at it until she managed to collapse it or climb over it."
The_Yodacat	2021-04-24 15:12:49+00:00	Kids handle death better than most people think. Adults are the ones with the hang-ups.	"When the day comes you need to explain death, think hard about why it's so difficult. Kids may not fully understand or accept the permanence of it, but they'll ""get it"" and probably ask questions that make *you* the uncomfortable one in the conversation. Have they smushed a bug? That was a learning opportunity. Take the opportunity early to explain that the bug's body doesn't work anymore. It won't see or feel or think thoughts anymore. Then when the time comes, whether a pet or family member, that foundation is laid. Children can handle most of the heavy burdens of life more than people give them credit for. Don't even be afraid to lean on them when the time comes. That last part is from personal experience."
Gingersnapandabrew	2021-04-24 15:10:31+00:00	My husband is getting ready to deploy and I'm scared	"My son has just turned 2, he doesn't talk much, so I am not sure how much I can explain it to him, or how much he can understand either, but Daddy is about to go away to the other side of the world for a few months. With the time zone change, he will only be able to talk to him at weekends as he will be at work when our son is awake in the week. I have no idea how he is going to be affected by it.   


Throughout the whole lockdown situation, I have been working full time from home, so my son is used to having me at home all the time, but working. Whereas, my husband was working shifts, so was at home and able to play and be the ""fun parent"" more often. He asks for ""Dada"" when he wakes up in the morning, and always wants Daddy to tuck him into bed at night. When my husband has gone to work before my son has woken up in the morning, he runs around the house looking for him for ages until I can explain to him that Daddy has gone to work and will be home later. I don't know what he's going to do when Daddy goes to work and doesn't come home for months.   


On a selfish point of view, I don't know how I'm going to cope either, how I will cope with tantrums without a back up, how to do bathtime without a second pair of hands when he refuses to get out of the bath even when the water is cold and the bubbles are long gone, how to get him to sit and eat his dinner when he wants to run outside when its raining. So many times my son tantrums for ages with me, until my husband walks in and then he stops as soon as he gives him a cuddle. I don't know how single parents do it, you are all stronger than I will ever be.   


We moved to a new place (not out of choice) half way through lockdown last year, and due to all activities being shut down due to the ongoing situation, I haven't met anyone other than my next door neighbour. I have contacted the support services here, and they have said they will let me know when things reopen, but they don't know when that will happen. I've moved away from my friends at our last Station, and our closest family are over 100 miles away, so its going to be hard. The last time he was deployed I was pregnant, so I've never done this before.

&amp;#x200B;

My little boy is such a happy soul, he is so confident, and I don't want that to change. I am so worried that on my own I won't be enough to keep him whole. I don't want that spirit to break. I knew this was part of military life, and I have always dealt with it well, but the thought of it hurting my little boy is breaking my heart."

DobroMoutro	2021-04-24 13:58:37+00:00	My 4y.o daughter was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. I feel lost.	"Hello r/Parenting. Long-time lurker here. I need to apologize in advance in case my text is a bit unclear. I am not an English native speaker and am currently very emotional which makes things even worse.

Here is my story. I am a 33 years old single father. After almost 2 years of harsh legal battles with my daughter's mother, I managed a year ago to establish a stable communication program with my daughter. My life turned instantly from total misery to total happiness. I now have my daughter 14 days per month and this stability made my depression evaporate. Nothing could bring me down anymore in day-to-day life. I love my daughter more than anything and we have a really strong bond since I was very involved from the moment she was born. 

Everything good, right? Well, yes, until this week. My daughter has been complaining of pain in her foot frequently since she was 2. Mostly later in the evening or she would wake up after going to bed. At first, we didn't think much of it. We thought it might be growing pains and our pediatrician wasn't very concerned. But the pains kept being very frequent at rates of maybe half of the nights she would wake up and we had to give her painkillers. Recently we decided we had to look at this further, visited other pediatricians, and long story short, after many blood tests, MRIs, and visits to pediatric rheumatologists she was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). I somehow knew deep inside that it wouldn't be something simple all that long but yet again it hit me like a train. From the information I gathered and was given by the doctors it seems it's a lifelong illness and patients often have many difficulties in life due to this. I don't even wanna think how bad it can develop in some cases. The go-to medical prescription for this case is Methotrexate, which is an immune-system suppressant used in treating illnesses like cancer, autoimmune and rheumatoid diseases among others. Some of the side effects are GI problems, dizziness, drowsiness, hair loss, and others. We were also suggested taking the injection version of the drug as it is more effective. This makes things even worse since she already had quite a few blood tests the past few days and is scared of injections at this point.

I don't know how to feel. I mean, I'm devastated thinking of all the bad things that could develop but maybe they are just the worst-case scenarios? After finally managing to bring emotional stability to my life and being happy, I feel knocked over. All the darkness from the past has now resurfaced but the fear for the future is so much worse. Is there anyone that has any experience with JIA, being a patient, or having someone close? What is it like in reality long term? I know I need to keep positive and not let my daughter feel my sadness but how do you suggest I handle it? Having to deal with this along with her mother, who is very hostile against me makes things even worse but I can handle this. To be honest, I have managed to take aside my personal feelings for her and try to be as much supportive of her I can be, as she seems to be in need of this too but as soon as I have a different opinion I am being diminished to useless, careless and an egoist.

Please, let me know what you think, anything that you feel might help. I feel lost. Thank you for your time."
asscockhunter	2021-04-24 13:49:27+00:00	"Two boys going to different schools: One in Britain, one in America"	"I have two boys who are six years apart. We live in America but my husband wants the elder son to study at a British boarding school because it's his family tradition. He is okay with the younger son going to any American school as long as it's a boarding school. The boys are currently in the same school in the US but they will be separated next year when the elder (who's 12) goes to the UK

Forget about the logistical nightmare etc, could this separation have a damaging effect on the children? I wanted them to be close but they're already six years apart.

Anybody else experienced this or know someone? Can you call this ""raising two kids with two different lives""? The elder son will be exposed to British culture and he will definitely attend a British university just like his father (more years of separation from his little American brother). What do you guys think?  

To be clear, I am not against boarding schools or sending my son to another country but I am asking if this will affect their relationship, emotional development and mental health."

Hi everyone,
So my situation is really complicated but ill try my best.

I've always looked forward to graduating and going to prom, I’ve been watching high school live graduations for 5 years, same thing with watching prom vlogs and even choosing dresses for my own :)

Anyway I live in a small hellhole town with my father because of his job, and my school is a horrible place, they're not hosting a prom or a graduation, not because of corona but they're just ignoring us because no one even cares and everyone hates everyone and the school is horrible in every aspect, prom is the only problem.

We're originally from the city, both my brother and mother moved back to the city two years ago and they wanted me to go back with them but I refused to and I would always say that I hated how crowded and busy the city was(I lied)
About eight months ago I really wanted to move to the city because I really hate this town and I wanted to go to a good school and I even started with the transferring process but I didn’t move because I didn’t want my father to live here all alone which is the real reason I didn’t wanna move with my mother and brother but I never tell them.
Now I'm a senior in high school and I’ve been crying over the fact that I won’t be having a prom or a graduation ceremony I’m literally going crazy!!
And also the fact that I’m graduating from here????? I’ve NEVER thought this would ever happen, I’ve always hated this place with every single fiber of my being AND I was the one who chose to stay here and for what? For my father who now tells me that I’m ungrateful and uncaring about everyone around me?
Whenever I open up to him about my depression because I live here he says I’m just ungrateful and lazy because I wanna blame someone else for my mistakes.
It drives me crazy that I’ve wasted all my high school years and I let go of the only thing that I’ve always been looking up to (prom and graduation) for him just to say this to me.
Now I feel like I just can’t do anything, I can’t move on and I don't know what to do"

I'm a father of a 4-year-old and a 10-month-old. My 10-month-old had neurosurgery at 5 months and is a high-needs kid. I have major depressive disorder so regular life is already hard enough as it is. Lately I am just so burnt out on being a parent. Every day is punctuated by screaming, fussing children. I have no family who can help me with the kids, my parents and grandparents are all deceased, and my sister has severe mental health issues and cannot be trusted alone with the kids. My wife had some family but they are not local to us.

I have tried just accepting that life is miserable until the kids get a bit older, but every day feels awful. Meds and therapy help me, but there's only so much they can do."

Now my toddler has a thing about whenever we leave the house regardless of the weather she wants some form of a coat on. For the longest time it would only be her winter coat which was fine during the winter however now she has broached to say a little denim jacket or an anorak. However these melt downs have now also moved on to her having bare arms. For example I put her in a short sleeved t shirt this morning that was perfect for the weather, my daughter isn’t hugely verbal but will point about what she wants etc. She started crying and searching her drawers for a jumper and only settled when I put one on her. She’s been the same about having shoes on and whilst this has mellowed out she will still have melt downs if she doesn’t have some form of shoe on. I’m worried that whilst the shoes are easily to accommodate long sleeves are not. She’s young enough that she can be affected by the weather and it gets seriously hot here. Can anyone give me some advice if they’ve been in a similar situation and what they did to overcome? It’s at the level if she’s wearing a hoodie it needs to be zipped up as well it can’t be open and neither can her jacket ."

Last week she woke up crying that her bed was wet, and I was so confused - did she spill her water? The bed was soaked and by the smell it was MOST definitely pee. However her pull-up was almost totally dry!! Since then it has happened 3 more times to varying degrees, always with the pull-up staying mostly dry. Is it going around the sides/back? Are the pull-ups defective? (They’re target brand, which I have been using for over a year) Is she getting too big for the pull-ups to fit well? 

Has this happened to anyone else? Is it time to night train? I guess I should get a new pack to rule out then being defective first..."
Jackie3178	2021-04-24 11:07:37+00:00	Should he tell his son or not?	"My friend has been divorced for a few years and has custody of his 8 year old son.

Custody wasn’t finalized due to the pandemic so he had to go back to court. Since his ex falsified and, after the lawyer investigated, failed her drug test the first time he suspects she is still using meth. Another test was requested.

She didn’t show up at court so they rescheduled. She then showed up without a drug test and refuses still to take one.

The court said visitation is at the discretion of the father and he doesn’t want to allow his son to visit until she takes a drug test.

Apparently, while previously visiting his mother the son was prepped for this court date by mom. She made it appear the father doesn’t want him to see her when in fact that is not the case. He just wants him to be in a safe environment and not around meth.

You can tell the son is quietly blaming the father for the lack of visitations to his mother.

Should the father be straight forward with his son and tell him in a delicate way about the court’s drug test failures, lack of compliance is the reason why he cannot see his mom.

Right now he just says these are grownup issues and tells him it will work out don’t worry about it."

He does fine during the day for the most part, but at night, all he does is cough. Yesterday morning, we were up at 3:30 and I had him propped up in his swing, he slept for most of the morning while I got ready for work. He's currently propped up in his swing again with me watching over him. We run a cool mist humidifier every night next to the crib and suck out his nose with a bulby.

At the moment they are waking up anywhere between 6am-7am which suits us.

 We also tend to feed them differently to us eg - I'll make them tomato pasta and veg and we will have salad. Its costing £££ on the weekly shop (let alone the effort of making two meals every day) so I wonder whether people recommend eating the same thing, together. 🤔"

Encourage your kids to tell you immediately if one of their friends is thinking of killing themselves, even as a ""joke"" or aren't ""serious.""

Teach your kids that it's better their friends get in trouble for ""no reason"" or even get ""mad"" at them for being a tattle tale then to have one of their friends take their own life. 

If you hear about a kid not doing well take action IMMEDIATELY. Notify the school, the kids parents, or go to the police to ask for a welfare check. 

Yes, you should call, yes you should speak up. Every. Single. Time.

Teach your kid that their bf/gf saying they will kill themselves if they break up needs to be reported to adults right away.

Tell them to speak up if their friends have done questionable things like getting a gun or a stash of pills. 

Be an advocate for the teens in your life beyond your own kids. Keep their friends safe and enlist your kids to keep their eyes peeled for warning signs. 

You are never ever wrong for getting kids help. It's never just a ""joke."""

We will be moving in about 2 months when our daughter will just about be 2 and a half. She has been bed sharing with us since she was born. I know, it's not good but it is what it is now. Anyways my husband would like her in her own room since she will have one now, I would like her in her own room to but personally I love bed sharing with her. I love waking up to her and cuddling her. It's definitely going to be difficult for me but I know it will be for her as well which is my concern. I want to make the transition as smooth as possible. She has never slept without me. She has slept in her crib but would always wake up and want to be with us. We will be in a new house so I don't want to just be like here is your room in this new place now good night! It's not fair to her to do so many changes so I just want to go about this the right way so she does eventually want to sleep in her own bed in her own room and be comfortable. 

Any advice on where to start? Do we still all bed share in our room for awhile or do we sleep in her room with her to get her used to the room then move out?

Thanks for reading!"
Ethereal_unicorn	2021-04-24 05:07:44+00:00	How do I become a better father to my five year old daughter?	"I love my daughter and I've been told I'm a good parent or at least I used to be before personal issues got in the way. Anyway my partner decided to separate with me a year or so ago and I see my daughter from Sunday to Wednesday. Which is remarkable compared to what others get in terms of time. We're very amicable and her mother is amazing.  


So, to the point of things, since she started school she's becoming more and more different from who she was (she's growing up making friends etc) and I find it hard to relate to her at times, especially as she is not very talkative alsoshe tends to moderate her behaviour depending on who she is with.   
   
What can I do to connect to her more? What would you have needed as a five year old from your dad?"
dbthrowawayrowaway	2021-04-24 05:02:53+00:00	"Objecting to DH screaming insults at DD is ""undermining his parenting"""	"(This post will be long and have a lot of venting about DH's not-so-great characteristics. Of course, it doesn't tell the whole story of who either of us are.)


DH and I have a three-year-old DD, which is a fun age, but she pushes buttons like any three-nager. It gets to DH worse than it does to me, I think for two reasons: One, I telecommute and have her with me basically all the time, so I have more experience correcting or averting bad behaviour before it starts. Two, he just naturally has a faster temper, especially when he's trying to multitask. That was the situation this evening when he was trying to make dinner (I was working in the other room) and DD had an accident in her pullup (she's almost fully toilet-trained but not quite). He went to change her. Obviously he wanted to change her quickly and get back to making dinner, so he got impatient when she wanted to look at the animals on the pullup first. He kept grabbing the pullup away and trying to force her into it and she was wriggling and trying to grab it back. I could hear him raising his voice at her, until finally he just thundered, ""FINE, HAVE IT YOUR WAY YOU LITTLE BRAT!"" and stormed out the room and slammed the door while she burst into tears. I went into the room, let her look at the pullup for the two seconds that this little game needs, got her in the pullup, and she was just fine and went back to playing with her toys. 


I know this doesn't sound bad in the grand scheme of things, but to add context, this is not at all the first time I've had a problem with the way he talks to DD. He's yelled at her that she's a brat or a little monster more times than I can count. Sometimes she'll be pushing his buttons and he'll cope fine for a few minutes but then (FLIP SWITCH) he starts yelling, ""EVERYONE WILL HATE YOU IF YOU KEEP BEING LIKE THIS!"" Other semi-frequent refrains in the household (especially on Sunday mornings, which is my sleep-in day and when he probably thinks I can't hear him even though he's so loud he would wake up Mars) are things like ""WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?"" 


We argued a while ago over him telling DD that people will hate her, and he's stopped doing that, thankfully. But he definitely doesn't think he's doing anything wrong when he screams at DD that she's a brat. I know this because he literally said those words to me this evening, after her bedtime. He was mad at me because he felt I was ""undermining"" him because, in his words, ""I put her in her room because she was being disobedient and you went in right away to 'rescue' her [with air quotes]."" I said that was not the full story of what happened and that I won't passively ignore him shouting and name-calling her. He said he sees no problem with ""calling her a brat"" (I guess we'll just ignore the angry screaming?) and that it's worse for her to see her parents undermining each other's discipline techniques.


While I generally agree with him that parents should be on the same page for discipline, I told him that when he's screaming insults at a three-year-old, I disagree that I have to feign quiet acceptance and pretend like I'm okay with it. I DON'T want her thinking that this is okay, either as a way to be treated or as a way to treat others. I outright told him I think he models a bad way of being angry. 


Honestly (and I didn't say this because I didn't think of it at the time), if he thinks that going in there and staying calm while solving a problem is ""undermining"" him, that's ... pretty weird, right? Surely undermining would be more like, ""Oh, DD, your silly daddy is screeching at you again! Let's just ignore him while he has his temper tantrum.""


So AITA? We're at an impasse over this, because he really thinks there's nothing wrong with how he talks to DD. I disagree and think that in the long run, she could actually be more harmed by her dad's words (and the implication that I agree with them, by my silence) than by the supposed undermining.


For those who probably think I'm a complete pushover with DD, or I'm falling into some sort of good-cop-bad-cop dynamic, neither is the case. I discipline DD far more than DH does (if for no other reason than I'm home all day with her and can't have a holy terror running around when I'm trying to work, haha). And I'm far from perfect -- I lose my temper and yell sometimes too. But mostly DD is a wonderful, well-behaved kid and we use timeouts when she's not. I've never objected to a timeout that DH has put her in, even if I privately think she wasn't being naughty. We try not to criticize each other in front of her. And (although this post may suggest a different story), I do believe that overall, we parent well together. But this is just a line in the sand for me and I simply don't want anyone screaming insults at DD, even her own dad. 


I guess at the end of the day, my question is simple: Who's right? And slightly more complicated: If neither of us are willing to budge from our positions ... what do?"

eccentricbirdlady	2021-04-24 03:39:49+00:00	My 1 year old will hold the same toy literally all day	"Hi all! I'm a first time mom of a 13 month old son. My boy is a delight; very active, social, and highly spirited. He does this thing though that's weird,  my mom says she's never seen it before,  and I can't find anything on Google about it. He started a couple months ago and it's become more and more common for him to do this. He will every day without fail choose what we call ""the toy of the day."" It's something small that he can easily hold and carry in one hand, like his self feeding spoon, a little toy animal,  a car, or even a small stuffy. It's different every day but he has some favorites that are chosen more often. Sometimes he will switch toys partway through the day but it's the same thing,  once it's in his hand he just doesn't let go.  No amount of distracting,  playing with other toys,  moving to another location, etc, will make him let go. He holds it while he plays,  reads books, cuddles, he holds it while I put his clothes on, switching it from one hand to the other. He sometimes even insists on holding it while he eats. He falls asleep holding it when he takes a nap and I remove it from his crib, but if I take it before he's asleep he has a melt down.  If I take it away for any reason he will have a melt down. The only way is for him to decide he wants something else more and put it down himself bit I can watch the little gears turn in his head while he decides if he's willing to put it down like it's a really serious decision. Every night we have to go through his bedtime routine,  brushing teeth and putting his sleep sack on, at which point he can't hold it anymore so we have to make a big show of very gently putting the toy ""night night"" and tucking it in and this still occasionally makes him cry.  

It's like he gets something in his hand and that becomes his comfort item but only for that day? Or maybe he intends to play with it later and is just holding onto it until then? Maybe he simply forgets he's holding it, but then why is he so upset if it's removed from him? In any case,  is this something I should be concerned about? He is very strong willed and tests boundaries wherever he finds them- maybe this is just some kind of self empowerment for him? I try not to make a big deal out of it. I never take it away forcefully or hide it from him, because I feel like if he thinks I don't want him to do it then he'll be even more insistent on it. It's not a big deal, just a little weird and nobody I know has ever seen a 1 year old do this so I don't know if it's something I should be concerned about or just a phase that he'll eventually outgrow."

We always keep an eye out for her and one time she got out and locked herself out accidentally letting the dogs out. We hated that and took extra precautions that it wouldn't happen again by setting alarms (which her step-dad disabled because they were ""too loud"") and double shifting so we are watching her every second of the night. The my gfs mother scolded the hell out of us for this and we felt terrible.

A few months later (aka tonight) they wanted to have a sleepover with our girl and we let them. I was having some down time and my girlfriend was taking a shower when we found out that out daughter has been running around the house for 15 minutes while my gfs mom fell asleep watching her and her step-father left her alone and awake to run around. She could have gotten outside again, but this time at night.

Should I confront them about how it's kind of hypocritical for them to do exactly what they told us not to? I don't want them to hate me and kick me out from staying the night but I also don't want them to get away with setting us up for failure and yelling at us when they when we do, then doing it themselves.

I am saving up so we can move out together and do this right but I'm working overtime so my girlfriend can afford to watch our child so she can't work. It's a long term goal at this point and I feel defeated."

Unfortunately for my daughter, now that dad has moved out he is not returning her calls or texts and she feels even more sad than she was when he actually left the house. Given our history, I know he’s waiting for me to explode and make some low blow comments so he can reply to me as the victim but I’m not taking the bait. But obviously I am FURIOUS inside. I signed up for a coparenting app and sent him the link and of course he has no connected to it . God I’m so pissed and sad for my kids. It blows my mind how some parents can be pissed at their ex and take it out on the kids"

NecessaryStatement84	2021-04-24 01:42:19+00:00	Second time mom guilt	"Hi all! I’m at stay at home mama and we just had our second kiddo in Feb, 2 days before my son’s 3rd birthday. I was already feeling a bit of mom guilt from the covid burnout(we got out hiking and to small unpopulated parks, but I definitely got more burnt out since I suddenly became his only playmate.)

He is amazing with our daughter and always tells her he loves her, but I can tell he is sad when he looks at me.  I am so worn out by trying to juggle them that by the time my husband gets home, he basically takes care of and plays with our son while I do dinner/take care of our daughter.

I miss spending quality time with my little guy and he’s told me multiple times that he misses me, but every time I offer to spend time with just him, he insists he wants to do something with the whole family (sister included). 

I also find myself losing my patience with him a lot more over little things that shouldn’t cause that reaction(for example asking for help putting on shoes or insisting that I feed him when he has been doing those things by himself for a long time!).  I hate getting upset about those things, and he gets so sad when I tell him no, but most days I just don’t have the bandwidth for it!

For those of you that have been through this, when does it get better and what are some good ways to make him feel special other than talking to him about it and playing with him as much as I can?"

giraffelegs872	2021-04-24 01:35:07+00:00	Daycare Frustration	"Disclaimer: I know that tons of families are still without daycare due to the pandemic, and I super empathize. I recognize that we’re really fortunate that ours has been open most of the pandemic and that we’ve felt comfortable sending our child. 

Our daycare has been closed for nearly four months now due to storm damage. At first, I was super understanding - it wasn’t anyone’s fault and these things take time. 

When the daycare initially closed, they said it would be short term, but that they didn’t know how long, and they offered spots at their “sister” locations. However, we didn’t feel comfortable sending our child there and chose to stay home. 

For awhile, we heard two more weeks. But nearly every update we got was because I requested it (every 2-4 weeks). 

Finally, this last month, we start to receive some updates that they’re going to open. We then went through a series of “we are hoping to open Monday and will give you an update shortly”, followed by silence. I’d email on Thursday or Friday, and receive a “oh yeah, we’re not going to open on Monday, but we’re hopeful for NEXT Monday”. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. 

Last week, they sent out a notice to saying that we’d get information x, y, and z by these specific dates. And then complete silence afterwards. I finally reached out yesterday and received a completely blasé, “Oh yeah, we’re opening on Monday!” (and also saying she’d follow up with more info, which hasn’t happened.) 

Today, we drove by the daycare to peek at the construction...and they were open! Apparently it was a “preview” for the parents that used one of their other locations, but I’m still pretty mad. Not that we weren’t included or that they did a limited opening, but that there wasn’t any communication for the daycare community as a whole. They still haven’t issued any daycare-wide communication that they’re opening Monday with the other details promised to us previously. 

I’m at the point now where I’m really questioning my trust in the daycare’s management and keeping my kid there. 

How do I know if they’re going to properly communicate potential issues in the future? Also, how do I trust that they’re on top of other managerial things when this was handled so poorly? 

I’m interested to hear other parent’s opinions, as I worry I might be overreacting."

Recently, my family and I got diagnosed with gastroenteritis. Our symptoms began to appear about 3 days ago &amp; since my 3 year old, my husband &amp; I seem to have recovered by 80%. We were all perscribed zofran, and all of our vomiting has stopped.

 My 16m old however, she is still having diarrhea &amp; has vomited about 3 times since taking the zofran ( roughly once a day) . She is eating, having a good amount of soiled diapers &amp; has energy to play. I cant help be feel worried for her still. 


Anyone else have experience with gastroenteritis with similar aged toddlers ( mine is 16m old) . 

If so, how long did it last &amp; what was it like?

AShyRansomedRoyal	2021-04-24 00:53:01+00:00	Snoo Sleeper: yay or nay?	"35 FT(bio) mom here in need of some input.

Before this morning I had never even heard of the Snoo sleeper. Then a friend of mine recommended it saying that it is the GOAT of all baby gear and that her child is still a good sleeper because they had one for him.

I looked it up and read rave reviews. I’m a big fan of the Happiest Baby on the Block method and this was developed by the same doctor. Plus it’s (supposedly) the only bassinet ever proven to prevent SIDS.

This evening when I mentioned it to my cousin as a new must-have, she immediately warned me against it. She said that babies who use it have a terrible time sleeping anywhere else. She never used it with her son though so I’m unsure if her feedback is valid, but it does seems to make sense.

I would love to get a consensus from those who have personally used it. It’s a pretty significant investment - we would be renting one but even still, the price tag is hefty. Thanks so much!"

Katalos	2021-04-24 00:39:03+00:00	"Our 7 months old sleeps less than 8 hours, and doesn't take nap. Is she ok?"	"She started sleeping through the night in her bassinet at around 4 months old, and doesn't nap during day. She sleeps around 9-10 hours in the night and seems to have all the energies in the world, so we were not too worry even a ""normal"" 3 months old should sleep 14-17 hours.

When she overgrew her bassinet at around 5 months old, we got her a proper crib and that's when our nightmare (mostly my wife's) starts. She wakes up every 3 hours for nursing, exactly like when she was 0-3 months old. We thought it might be the crib and she needs some time to get used to it. We don't have a choice anyway because she is too heavy for her old bassinet.

She is now almost 8 months old, still wakes up every 3 hours, sleeps at the same time like us (around 12-1 am), wakes up at around the same time like us (around 9-10 am, sometimes as late as 12 pm), and has a lot of energy during the day. We are getting a little worried because she effectively sleeps less than 8 hours most of the time, which is very far off the ""normal"" 12-16 hours for a 7 month old.

Is she going to be ok sleeping so little? If not, how should we fix it?"
DCLetters	2021-04-24 00:33:39+00:00	3 year old and masks	"We've been working from home while watching our 3 year old son since the pandemic started. As such, he's been out of daycare and lacking a lot of social interaction. A big part of this problem is that he refuses to wear a mask. He's a very stubborn child, and has probably worn one for a couple of minutes at most before pulling it off. We've tried treats, activities, pointing out other children wearing them, talking about his concerns, but he absolutely refuses.

We're trying to get him back to his daycare (which he loved before he was pulled out a year ago) but the daycare requires masks, and I'm worried one of us will have to quit our jobs to watch him if he can't learn to start wearing one soon.

This has been a hard situation for all of us - is anyone else dealing with stubborn toddlers and masks? we'd appreciate any advice."

Time_To_Unbulk	2021-04-24 00:18:56+00:00	My 7 Y/O daughter is a people pleaser	"She goes out of her way to please other kids in her class. Like the other day she was talking online to one of her friends and asked for permission to call her back in 10mins.

Her friend replied no and when I told her she needs to leave the call for dinner she became EXTREMELY apologetic towards her friend and cut the call.

Afterwards when she called her friend back, her friend refused to talk to her and that devastated her.

It’s not just that one friend, it seems in almost every relationship she establishes with her classmates she takes a submissive role where she doesn’t mind being degraded as long as the two of them are “friends”.

This will potentially lead to her being used by others down the road and I’m not sure how I can fix this issue. She’s really optimistic and sees the best in others, I don’t want to take that away."

momof_5_girls	2021-04-24 00:15:49+00:00	Not sure what to do about summer camp..	"This is very hard decision about what were my favorite memories growing up that are complicated by COVID. So this is mostly about my three oldest. ""D"" will be 9 this summer, ""A"" will be 8 and ""K"" will be 7. 

The first camp I am wondering about is a very special camp. I grew up loving it and I would work there every summer as a counselor and bring my girls when they were too young to camp. We also know the family that knows it very well. They are very excited to be campers. The issue is you have to be at least 8 for the young week. My oldest was finally old enough last year but was taken away because of covid. She was so upset, she packed her bag and we would go through the schedule just like we were there to help her feel better. 

This year covid seems a lot better but is not gone yet.  My two oldest are now able to go be campers and the camp even opened up registration but I'm a little nervous. It is a very small camp ( about 50 campers on a normal year.) But I am still nervous about it. This camp is 5 nights. 

The other camp I wanted to talk about is girl scout camp. These camps are usually just 1-3 nights and are opening up for the summer. These camps let 7 year olds come so ""K"" is thrilled. All of their girl scout friends are talking about going and my daughters are getting so excited.

I don't know what to do I feel like they have sacrificed so much and they have been soo good and understanding  about it. But it is an issue about health. I just feel so torn."

We have 50/50 custody of our 3 year old. In our agreement it states the other parent may call the child on weekdays from 6-8pm. However, he never picks up. I’ve been messaging him to keep track of all the times he declines my calls. 

I’m assuming this would be considered contempt of court - I would have to talk to a lawyer. However it would seem so petty to file contempt of court over not picking up the phone. All it literally is, just 10 mins of us telling each other we love each other and her telling me about her day. He would pick up every now and then but now he doesn’t at all. I guess the advice I’m looking for is would you do it?

A little background, she misses a lot of daycare and I don’t know who he leaves her with or why she misses daycare. He doesn’t keep her on a schedule. He lets her eat whatever she wants and go to sleep whenever she wants. Whenever I try communicating with him he says it is none of my business what he does with her and gets defensive. I guess he’s right in a sense, but I’d like to keep her on a routine especially since I just bought a house and he lives with a bunch of people.

Both of them have been exhibiting bad behavior at daycare, as well as at home— but the bad behavior is worse at daycare. For example, hitting, spitting, cussing, destroying things— things we normally don’t see at home (we mostly just see toddler tantrums). We have begun sending the kids to their rooms for timeout for a time after they get home if they are badly behaved at daycare, but we’re unsure it is working and they are about to be kicked out of their SECOND daycare of the year. We don’t know what to do at this point. They are in therapy but we’re unsure that seems to be working (although they’ve only been seeing the therapist about six weeks). Does anyone have any advice?

Vanelsia	2021-04-23 23:05:27+00:00	My child's doctor said something disturbing today and I'm thinking of changing doctors.	"We went for a vaccine today and she couldn't stop crying. She's very afraid of doctors in general. We have been going to this one since she was born. At some point the doctor got annoyed by the constant crying and said, with a serious expression, something like 'ah, x is a crybaby. She's going to have a very unhappy life, sensitive people like that are never happy'.

I just realised this doesn't translate well into English, unhappy life sounds trivial, but what she said could also translate to 'lifelong sorrow', 'great misfortune' stuff like that. If someone here knows Greek feel free to ask me what it was and if you want, you can try translating it. 

I just said 'what? Let's hope not!' but the doctor insisted. At that point I felt sick, like a really bad and uncomfortable feeling. But I didn't continue on this. My baby was still crying.

Now I'm thinking of changing doctors. But this one knows her since she was born. She was neutral to nice to us depending on her mood in the past, which is better than most doctors here. And I want to believe that the whole thing was just her trying to joke using black humour. But it unnerved me greatly.

So, what do you think I should do?"

So I asked a question in here a few days ago about whether parents of teens in this group would want to hire their teenager a life coach!  
I bring this up because this is something I would've loved to have as a teenager that would've provided me with some guidance instead of feeling lost for so long. Someone outside of the family who I could share openly with!   
From what I read in the comments, most of you agreed that it would be a helpful tool and I totally understand why!   
I am doing some research on the subject and wondering what parents have tried to help their teenagers, but ended up not being successful with and what fears you have about their behavior...  
I know this will vary, but I just want to get a good idea. Every answer counts.

We don't spank or anything, though I have swatted her hand away from the electrical outlets before we got the protective stuff for it. I also have major depression, and had severe PPD. One of the things I did whenever I had a breakdown was hit myself pretty severely. I know I had a recent breakdown (not nearly as bad as it used to be, but still), and I'm worried maybe she saw it? 

I might be overthinking the situation. I know toddlers do weird things, and I'll be making an appointment with her pediatrician for more personalized advice.

We have 3 problems:

1) my husband works from home in the room beside my son's bedroom. 

2) since he sleep trained my son at 10 months he's the only one who can put him to bed. I'm a SAHM and if I try my son will throw a huge separation anxiety induced tantrum if I walk out of the room after getting him into bed. He won't fall asleep if I'm in the room either.  This is a problem at bedtime too.

3) starting in March naps were turning into hours long hysterical crying fits. My husband was having to go in multiple times to resettle him, and although he was following the sleep training methods we used last year, he thought it was abusive at this age to let him get this upset so husband quit nap duty, declaring son just doesn't nap anymore. 


My son is an absolute nightmare after about 2pm every day now. I can't do anything with him because he's such an over tired puddle of saddness. The kid needs a nap. I hate every second of my life being a SAHM now, and this situation is totally unsustainable. I haven't felt this burnt out and stressed since he was a newborn. 

He will nap in the car reliability, but wakes up screaming inconsolably every time and it's dangerous when I'm driving. I also live in a city that's very stressful to drive in, so this isn't a break for me at all.

I've tried imposing quiet time, but it's the same problem, son throws a meltdown if I leave the room and won't rest at all if I'm there. He makes so much noise in his bedroom that my husband can't work or hear phone calls.

His nap is also the only time that our weekends with him see anything resembling peace, because everything else is like trying to referee a toddler-size X Games (and if he doesn't nap, he's 10x worse -- he seems to find an extra gear of crazy that he'll be on for the entire afternoon). I chalk a lot of this behavior up to him being 3, but he's starting to get written up at daycare for doing things like hitting his teachers, climbing all over other students, and taking off his clothes. He has a particular thing with socks and shoes -- he just \*decides\* that this moment's hill to die on is having to wear them, and freaks out if he can't take them off. The hitting generally only happens when he's already melting down. His climbing on other people is because honestly, he climbs on everything, all the time. 

I try to keep his weekends as structured as his weeks, thinking that if he has something to do, somewhere to go, etc., it will help. And it does, but a lot of the time, it's like trying to decide what tupperware you want to carry your nest of angry bees in. My biggest issue is discipline: time-outs aren't effective unless I literally hold him down in the time-out area, because he'll just climb all over/get into wherever he is, and it's not like we have some empty cell for him. He loses his mind while I restrain him, but then completely forgets about it as soon as he's done with the time-out, and goes back to whatever he was doing before to earn a time-out in the first place. I grew up in a very heavy corporal punishment kind of house -- my mom would hit me with kitchen implements, tools, sticks, etc. I refuse to do that to my own kid, but I don't have a great model for disincentivizing his crazy behavior. 

I was told to try to incentivize good behavior, but to be honest, he just doesn't seem to be able to not be a crazy-high-energy-wall-bouncer all the time. He has tiny little periods where he can play quietly by himself, but they're rare islands in a sea of climbing/running/knocking stuff down/pulling out every toy/etc. He gets tired, but it doesn't slow him down, it just gets him strung out and acting worse, so I can't tucker him out at all -- if anything, I have to work on conserving his energy!

I'm at my wit's end. Am I supposed to just ride this out? I feel like a bad parent for not ""doing"" something, but when I think about how my parents stopped me from doing stuff (hitting the shit out of me), I don't have a solution that works. Help!"
omnomization	2021-04-23 20:19:33+00:00	"Toddler wakes up 30 min into his naps, what can we do?"	"Like clockwork, our 15-month-old will wake up 30 min into his nap and scream for 10-30 minutes before putting himself back to sleep. Luckily, he still sleeps through the night beautifully.

His crib has been converted into a toddler bed and when he's done napping after about 2 hrs he'll get up and knock on the door to let us know he's ready to come out. However, during these episodes he'll just roll around in bed, crying and screaming. I read that he could be overtired and needs an earlier nap. Or it could be night terrors, but he seems to be fully awake when we hit our 30 min threshold and go to check on him.

My SIL says that her daughter went through a similar phase for a few months and it just stopped one day. So far it's been about 6 weeks of this for us. I'm just at such a loss at what to do, it's so heartbreaking to listen to."
Hibirddog	2021-04-23 20:09:52+00:00	Unwanted Hugging: 3 year old perpetrator	"My 3.5 year old daughter is a hugger. We aren't overly affectionate at home, but certainly not lacking hugs and snuggles. Recently her preschool teacher tells me she has been ""hugging and hanging onto"" friends too much. Example: during story circle time, she will saddle up next to a friend, lean over, and hold them around their waist during the story. Or put her head on their shoulder. The idea of it gives me a split reaction: ""aww"" and ""yikes- that's weird"".

I've tried to tell her to high-five friends at school and just hug her family, but it doesn't seem to be working.

She learns well from books. Any book recommendations on physical/social boundaries? Seems a little early to have to be dealing with this topic, but here we are."
Delicious-Spread3824	2021-04-23 20:05:50+00:00	This isn’t exactly about parenting but kind of related...	"I have a 18 month old boy and one on the way. Since having my first son, I feel like my husband and I have lost some of our spontaneity. He is an amazing dad and husband, he works incredibly hard so that I can stay home. So this is in no way blaming him, I think it probably happens with most couples. My question is, what are little things that y’all do to keep the romance alive while trying to keep up with being parents and adults and all the things?"
lemonade0519	2021-04-23 19:58:25+00:00	Our 7 year old stabbed his brother today.	"We have 2 boys, ages 9 and 7. Our 7 year old is constantly getting in trouble at school for talking, getting up, etc. Likely he's bored, he's very smart and is enrolled in GT to help engage him. 
My big issue is his inability to regulate his behavior, mostly at home. Today he and his brother were fighting over a damn pencil and his brother pulled at his shirt and hair. He responded by stabbing his brother in the head with the pencil. This is a new level of violence for him. The wound was pretty bad and bled a lot.
For corrective actions we take away his beyblades and tablet when he acts up at home. He doesn't care. We tried rewarding him for good behavior at school but that didn't motivate him either. 
Is this behavior something that speaking with a counselor would help? Is this just because of his age and he'll mature and grow out of it?
I'm scared he's going to do something violent at school or if he's on a play date.
Thanks to those who have read this. Parenting is hard!"
youreornery	2021-04-23 19:57:22+00:00	Seeing Red	"My toddler boy LOVES the color red. 🙄 He only wants to wear “bright” red shirts, preferably long sleeved, no logos or adornments. 

I’ve amassed an assortment but of course they’re all different shades so I get a lot of NOT THAT ONE sadness (and only one of them sort of matches his fav red hat, which drives me MAD). Also haven’t found a single pair of pajamas that are red with no stuff on them, so putting on pjs is not fun (which it used to be, I swear). I know, he’s a toddler and we’re gonna have meltdowns but if I can do something simple to reduce stress I’m all for it. So, I’d love to find a uniform for him, something soft and lightweight I can buy in multiples to replace our jumble and get us through the summer. Help! 

I checked Primary but they’ve nothing long sleeved at the moment, and I’m in Canada if that makes a difference. TIA!"

1SpyseeChikn	2021-04-23 19:36:26+00:00	Other parent confiscated phones I pay for	"Maybe I should have posted this in r/custody but it’s kinda toxic over there. Basically, I bought my daughters phones, and pay the bill, over a year ago. They live with their dad and I’d like having as little communication with him as possible. However, because he’s toxic and childish, he keeps creating scenarios where I would HAVE to contact him. 

The reason I initially chose not to talk to him  and bought the phones in the first place is because he was constantly disrespecting me and my husband. For years he didn’t even have my phone number and was forced to contact me via email which made him think twice about the messages he sent. 

For the past year while my daughters have had their phones, every few days/weeks, they’d be in trouble for the smallest things and he’d take their phones for a long time. For example, if they were still up at 8:31 on a school night and their bedtime is 8:30, he’d take the phones for two weeks. Always looking for reasons to take the phones from them. 

Well my oldest daughter is 11 and she now has a gf. I’ve talked to her about this (both liking girls and having a gf/bf) and though I don’t like it because I think she’s too young to date, I don’t think it warrants a punishment. He however, not only took her phone but her sister’s as well and said he was going to send them back to me. I had to find this out through my youngest sneaking to talk to me on Facebook kids. I hadn’t heard from them in two weeks at that point and still don’t have the phones. 

I’m so tired of going through this. My daughters are tired of going through this. On one hand, yes I am refusing to talk to them through him because I know his ego will be happy about it and I hate that. More importantly though, he took the phones without telling me and I’m still paying the phone bill on them. He is one of the most disrespectful humans it is my misfortune to know personally. I REALLY don’t want to call to speak to my daughters just for him to mention his wife for no reason (I also remarried), ask if I’m still unemployed (I’m a stay at home mom and chose my own hours), or be condescending in any other way. If I don’t want to talk to him first, he makes up some reason why I can’t talk to my daughters. 

Just please. If anyone has any sound advice, I’m all ears. I’m tired. Just so tired."
CapableSoul	2021-04-23 19:28:56+00:00	I’m struggling	"I’ve just had my second child; a daughter 8 weeks ago and I’m finding it so difficult. I also have a 2 and a half year old boy who luckily does go to nursery a couple times a week. I think you just really forget how hard the baby stage can be once your first gets older and easier. It’s hit me like a ton of bricks! My husband is a great dad when he’s home. But he’s gone most of the week at work. 

I’m pretty certain she has colic, since she’s okay through the day then it hits the evening and she just screams till she’s off for the night, so that doesn’t help things (my son never had colic) Although I’m so grateful and happy to have two beautiful healthy children, I’m just finding it hard while she’s so young and just screams. 

I’m not really sure what the point to this post is. When I try to talk to my family I just get the usual “it was your choice to have 2 kids so close together” which it was, but I did want to have my children close in age and then focus on  my career when they’re in education. I guess I’m just hoping for some advice and some positive words to get me through"
Dutchmile	2021-04-23 19:28:53+00:00	Do your kids like Disney movies?	"Maybe my priorities a little out of whack, and maybe I’ve thinking too much about this. My wife and I have been going back and forth about saving for future vacations and where we want to go. One of those places is Disney World. Neither of us have ever been, so I only really know as much about Disney World as my research and testimonies from my cousins have told me. 

The thing is, if I make a bunch of big plans and spend that much money for a Disney Vacation, I want it to be a treasured experience for my daughter and and future kids my wife and I have.(this vacation would still be years off, by the way). I feel like the best way for that to happen is if the kids are big fans of Disney.

So my question is, are your kids into Disney movies? If so, what age did they become interested. Right now my daughter really only likes Baby Shark vids and (apparently) Jack Hartman. She doesn’t really respond to Disney movies."
gamingkate	2021-04-23 19:24:38+00:00	Any advice how to teach 11 month old more independency in falling asleep?	"My soon to be toddler (still can’t believe it’s happening so fast!) is still very much set in her ways when it comes to falling asleep. What I mean by that is - she won’t fall asleep unless I’m rocking her in my arms walking around the house. 
If I sit down she immediately starts screaming and nothing other methods seems to work. It has to be rocking in arms and standing up. Sometimes when she’s completely drained she’ll fall asleep if I lay down next to her but that’s only happened a hand full of times since she was born. 
We co-sleep and I’d like to continue that for a while but I’m looking for ways I can slowly start getting her used to more independency in falling asleep.
Almost one year of carrying her for every single nap and nighttime sleep and my back is begging me to find an alternative. 
Has anyone had/overcome a similar situation with their little ones?
Would be incredibly grateful to hear any advice you guys may have!"

"My son is 16 years old, and lately he has been obsessed with this phrase ""keep that glizzy on me, whole lotta gang shit"". He says it to his friends all the time and it bothers me. What does this mean? Should I be worried?"
Byebyeguy	2021-04-23 18:36:26+00:00	Helping 10 year old with friends	" I have a 10 year old son that is a great, great kid. He’s kind, smart, and funny. From his teacher’s perspective, he gets along with everyone and they’ve never noted any kind of social issues. However we’ve noticed that he hasn’t developed any strong friendships in school. He goes in, he gets his work done, and then he comes home. Last year he had a few good friends that were in his class and I know he hung around with them a lot in school and we had all of them over various times, but it’s only been reciprocated here and there. I think part of that is because the kids are getting to the age where they are taking a more hands off approach to setting that kind of thing up. 

I think my son doesn’t really make a huge effort because he lacks confidence a little and does have a little anxiety.  If a neighbor comes over, he wants his older brother to stay out with them. Once he gets comfortable, there are no issues. 

Not really sure if I should do something or just leave it be. He’s happy at home, loves being here, and genuinely seems happy overall.  I think he is the type of kid that wants very close friends and that’s proven to be a little bit of a challenge. He seems to have an easy time being acquaintances with a lot of kids, but not many close friends. Occasionally he’ll say something that makes me think that he’d like to change that. Any ideas?"
Viperbunny	2021-04-23 18:21:34+00:00	Can the teachers stop giving my kids suggestions on how to spend their time?	"I know they mean well, but I am losing my damned mind. I have two kids doing remote learning. They are in different grades a year apart. They have school from 9 to 12:45. Then, they have meetings, specials and homework. I am a stay at home mom and I knew all my time would go into school. But I don't have anything left! Each special is at least a half hour. Every assignment is about a half hour. The little one has 4 specials, 2 social studies, and two science a week. My older daughter has that and two math assignments. On top of that, they have reading logs and math programs they are expected to log into. They have maybe an hour or hour and a half of meetings a week and about 10 frigging hours of homework.

Then, they have the nerve to tell the kids it is a nice day and they should go outside! How? I would love to go outside, but by this time it is almost 1PM. I have to get both kids lunch. I have to do the chores I couldn't do while they were doing work, because moving around is too distracting to the kids and the teachers send out reminders that the work space needs to be quiet. The kids eat lunch and then we try to get the work done by dinner time. We need to do at least two assignments a day. Sometimes, we get a lovely surprise, like a bigger project. Oh, and gym lessons are great. It was wonderful to have my kids doing donkey kicks in the living room! That totally is the type of destructive behavior I want them to learn to do all over the living room and totally didn't freak the cats out. The one time they assigned a nature walk it was too cold and rainy to go out! And with what time? I have two kids. I am one person. I have to sit with them to make sure they get their homework done. I have to help them and they always need help at the same time and have to wait. It can take time to go back and forth because it is less homework and more me teaching them the lesson. With only one of me, I can only go so fast. My husband does art with them, and takes any assignment that is art heavy because it is so stressful.

These projects require so frigging much that despite all the Amazon orders, I run out of boxes! It was lovely to have to spent two hours building cardboard robots and 3D room maps without any notice! It is lovely when the assignment requires two people! I can't do all the gym crap. I am a fat woman who has had health problems. I am getting healthier, but all these assignments rely heavily on high impact activities. I can ride a bike, walk, do low impact stuff. I can't be jumping and stomping around. I am already doing the homework and specials with them, now, I have to set up a game that I have to create the pieces for, all for five minutes worth of work.

&amp;#x200B;

And I have to do it ALL. I have parental stalkers who are looking for any way to insert themselves. If the kids fall behind in work, we will get in trouble. And that can give them a chance to say the kids need the extra support. They aren't supportive. They are abusive terrorist, but that doesn't matter in my state. They don't have legal standing now, but it is pretty easy to cause a situation where they can get it. Which is why my kids can't go in the yard without me! These stalkers can show up at any time, and with the weather getting nice that is far more likely. They aren't allowed on my property, but the police have declined to do anything to  help.

I am exhausted, emotionally and physically. I am sick of having to argue with my kids because they have to do their work first. If I take them outside they won't come in and get anything done. I wish I could reverse it, but it never works. I have tried it many times. I have no time to work on the things I need to do. I have no way to do chores because the kids need a completely quiet classroom and they are already unhappy that my kids do their work in the same room (I am one person, they are in the dining room and have their own desks). 

Today, the teacher did a lunch brunch so they could socialize. That is great, until she suggests they do it outside! I have another kid I am helping with. I can't be in two places at once. If I knew that was the plan, I would have set it up. But her computer is already no working and so I would have to try setting up my husband's computer (which is a pain in the ass) up while making lunch for everyone else! I didn't have the time or the ability. I had already been denying myself a trip to the bathroom because I was so busy. We plan to go out in a little bit, but that particular moment was a really bad idea. But as soon as it was suggested the mom guilt and fights started. It isn't fair.

I don't have anything left. My husband does take the kids after work, but it is a drop in the bucket. There is no way to get a break because if I need a drink or food or anything, I am the one to do it. I will get pulled into conversations. Even if I get a few minutes to myself my kids are so loud that I can't stand it. I grew up in abuse. The constant loud noises wear on my nerves. I am in therapy. I am on medication. I got my first round of the vaccine so I can do more. But I can't change that this is pandemic life. Even if I get a break it isn't enough to build up the stamina. I am trying to do all this while trying to find ways to protect us against our stalkers, who have been relentless for three years. I am so tired. I am so low. I have no way to get what I need. I feel like everyone is taking and taking and taking. I don't know what to do anymore."
nomad_9988	2021-04-23 18:11:58+00:00	Would you consider this abusive?	"A family member gifted my 3.5 year old about 1000 dum dum lollipops. We have been using them as treats for good behavior as we have had some problems with her behavior. 

The problem comes when she really really wants one right now. She will ask repeatedly over and over. I counted once, and she asked me over 40 times in the space of me trying cook dinner. So I had the brilliant idea to throw one away every time she repeats her question. We haven’t gone past 2 thrown out before she gets the message.  For the sake of my sanity, I needed this.  However, I told the family member who gifted the lollipops, and she says that this is emotional abuse. 

I had no idea until it was brought up. I can see both sides of this argument. I’m just hoping other parents can weigh in with their opinions."

I just gave birth to my little girl on April 15; she was induced, so it took a minute to get my milk to come in. But now, only a week later, and I’m already drying up. I’m more upset than I care to admit about it. 

I can’t decide if I want to let my supply completely dry up, or if I want to keep fighting to breastfeed while I’m too large for my baby to latch proper. 

I hope this is the right sub, figured it be more appropriate than r/babybump. Sorry if it’s not, I just wanted to shout it out to the ether to see if anyone else is having this problem, or if I’m overreacting to natural fluctuation in my supply while LO is solely bottle-fed."
averageredditcuck	2021-04-23 17:56:02+00:00	Should I cut off my father once he's done paying for my college?	" 

Here's a quick rundown of my loving father

· He Yelled a lot

· I cried a lot

· He’d yell at me for crying

· He’d yell at me for saying he was yelling

· This led to me crying at the first sign of confrontation for the first 13ish years of my life

· Didn’t trust me, I remember him asking if I was lying a lot

· He’d drive really fast and take sharp turns when he was mad at us

· I remember at least once where my brother and him were arguing in what’s now my room and then there was banging and my brother screaming. My brother might’ve been being dramatic, but still

· The most useful thing he ever taught me was how to get the last bit of toothpaste out of a roll of toothpaste. He showed me how to change oil on a car once, but jiffylube does that for free

· In general, never instilled any values or lessons in me

· Didn’t spend any time with me

· I mean we went fishing a couple times, we played poker when I was little, he was the assistant coach on my soccer team for like half a season, but he stopped cause his ego got in the way when I called him the assistant coach because he didn’t know as much about soccer as the head coach and the head coach had been the coach for the past several years, so he was kinda the assistant coach

· I listen to podcasts where the host has a new person on every show and the first thing he does is pretty much ask questions through their life story and I always hear about how large of a part their father played in their life. This figure that encouraged them and taught them and loved them and I don’t think I ever had that

· Went drinking on my brother’s birthday instead of hanging out with him. My brother is a shut in, family is all that he has and it was his fucking birth day

· When I was in the hospital for a head injury he told me not to let it happen again because it was costing him a lot of money

· Made fun of the way I talked during the recovery

· I feel like I recall him saying he was ashamed to be my father and in general just lots of awful things to say to a child

**· Abusive in all ways but physical, supportive in no ways but financial, but that just means you could replace him with a large enough check**

· So he was a piece of shit for most of my childhood, he was a piece of shit to me during the hardest year of my life(concussion recovery+quarantine.) What else could I possibly need him for? Not only has he not been a good father to me, but if he couldn’t do it at either of those times, I don’t think he’s capable of being a good father

· He’s failed me as a father

I want to call attention to the, abusive in all ways but physical, supportive in no ways but financial. I think the way I'll get back at him is when I'm done with college in 6 months, I'll stop talking to him. He does pay for my college which he'd hang over my head if I ever brought up his parenting (he always did that as a kid, ""I put a roof over your head, blah blah blah) but since I don't really get anything else out of the relationship, I don't see what I'll need him for once I'm done with school. Whatever inheritance I would've gotten would be worth less than getting to tell him that he's an awful person and he's an even worse father and that I abhor him. If he bitches about it, I'll tell him it was a piss poor investment on his part to put that much money into someone he treats like garbage. So what do you guys think, AITA?

tl;dr My dad is borderline abusive and I'm considering cutting him off once he's done paying for my college, the one bit of leverage and support I receive from him"
DriftingThroughLife1	2021-04-23 17:49:31+00:00	Charging rent questions.	"My 19F daughter and her boyfriend 18M live with us. We are by no means rich.

My daughter will be finishing school in June and starting full time work in September.  I would like to start charging them $200 each for rent (utilities split 4 ways equals $100 each) then $100 each for groceries. Does that sound fair?

aninspiredchild	2021-04-23 17:48:43+00:00	Young Makers and Risk Takers	"Hello I'm Lane. Flashback to early 2021 and I came across a book written by an eight year old boy about the Solar System. Bought said book and seemingly it captured my little guys attention far longer than the stories featured in the 'Little People Big Dreams' series of books which I had also bought at the same time.  

This obviously got me to start thinking...

WHERE CAN I BUY OTHER 'KID MADE' PRODUCTS?

Hence I'm hoping to ask this same question to the wider forum here.

Equally as I haven't found a regularly updated list or website where such products are featured I started to collect these stories on my own Instagram account 'aninspiredchild' under the thread 'Daring Dreamers'.  

During the early years at a time when these minds are so impressionable perhaps what can be most inspiring is seeing other young people Dream Daringly (is my thought).  And hence it is with this in mind that I've started to feature young makers and other risk takers following their dreams (firstly to inspire my little guy and hopefully now for the benefit of others).  

As such, would love to hear of other 'kid made' products you recommend (both because I'm interested to buy and also to feature!) 🙏♥️🌞 Thank you."

Ginger_ish	2021-04-23 17:27:31+00:00	How do you talk to a 4yo about death?	"My almost-4yo has been asking about death recently, and I'm just looking for tips on the best ways to respond. I know it's developmentally normal for kids around this age to start talking/thinking about death, but I've been caught flat-footed looking for a good response to her questions. 

Fortunately, she's only asking about it in relation to characters dying in movies, not as a result of a death in our family. I've been caught a bit off guard the couple of times she asked, so I've been vague (""Elsa's parents' ship got caught in a storm and sank"" and then ask her something else to distract her) or focused on people dying from old age (Moana's grandma), but she's clearly trying to understand how it works on real life because yesterday she asked if her great-grandma is going to die, and then asked if she herself is going to die one day (oof, that one hit me hard). 

I want to be matter-of-fact and straightforward, but not traumatize her with implications she's too young to emotionally handle. We're not religious--I'm an athiest, my husband is agnostic, though our families are Christian--so I don't want to rely on ""heaven"" or other religious-based stuff as a comforting explanation. I'm open to telling her that lots of people have different ideas about what happens when we die (I'm not hostile to religion and will be fine with her exploring and choosing what she believes as she gets older). 

Any resources, best practices, or scripts that have worked for you?

Thanks!"

Day after day he got a refusal (because bottle is easy to open and he could really eat content..). Today this shampoo went empy and i gave our baby empty bottle to play. I got the happiest excited and surprised smile, what i never saw before. Our baby had a highlight of the week/month/or his whole life!

I was not prepared to this happiness and need to grin the whole time right now! I also needed to share this moment with people who cares/understands. I hope this post reminds you of happiest moments for you children and gives you a smile!"
kay-moor	2021-04-23 16:28:12+00:00	How to get my toddler to consume healthy things?	"She loves anything in the grain category: rice, pasta, bread. She will eat them plain happily. She also likes fruits. However, meats are give and take and vegetables are rare for her. She will eat corn and sometimes green beans on a blue moon. 

I've tried finding vitamins that she will like but so far nothing. She likes these gummy vitamins that I got but they didn't contain any iron, so I got iron gummies and they literally taste like sugary blood so that was a no go. Got a liquid vitamin that I can mix into her drinks and she doesn't like that- she will give me the full drink and say, ""ew more"". I've resorted to toddler milk powder that contains vitamins (and iron) but I'm not really a big fan of the fact that the second ingredient is corn syrup solids. 

I'm an unhealthy person myself- I'm overweight and have a poor diet (have ever since I was little- think unlimited little Debbie's and mountain dew). Id like for her to have a different lifestyle than I and I try to feed her healthy things. She is a good weight and height so it's not that. I'm just worried about the nutrients. 

Any ideas?"
Active-Sheepherder-5	2021-04-23 16:03:17+00:00	My son has terrible friends	"My son (8) gets along with everyone and truly is a nice boy. I’m not just saying that because I’m biased either, other parents constantly tell me what a good kid he is. Problem is, the boys he chooses to become really good friends with are just awful. So bad, in fact, that the school is placing my son in a different class from two of them because they’re always either fighting or involving him into their trouble (he only gets in trouble when he’s with them).

I’m not one to dictate who he can and can’t be friends with, but one for sure I just “don’t have his mom’s number,” which will only work for so long. The other one lives next door and comes over all the time. I really really dislike that kid and I tell him my son can't play whenever I can get away with it. Nobody but me ever watches him or monitors his creepy behavior, he constantly lies, hits my dogs and last year I banned him from coming over until he proved to me that he would stop showing his penis to other kids. His parents don’t speak English and won’t come to the door when I knock, so I can’t really tell them about his behavior at my house. So my son is not allowed to play at his house at all, which makes me feel like a controlling jerk. Before anyone jumps to conclusions, the only one of my son's best friends that I genuinely do like also has parents who don’t speak English and I trust them 100%.

My husband isn't worried about this at all, he doesn't seem to care. His excuse is that his friends were always horrible too and he turned out ok. This is not comforting to me because my husband spent most of his teen years on drugs and all his former friends either OD'd or ended up in jail shortly after high school. 

Point is, I try to instill good morals in my son so he can have the tools to not get dragged into their messes and surround himself with good, trustworthy people.  I’m legitimately worried about this pattern in his life, choosing dreadful friends and not telling them to take a hike when they do bad things. What do I do? Just keep doing what I’m doing and hope he grows out of it? I don’t think he will, he’s always been attracted to the worst kid in the room and his cousins are pretty terrible too. Advice?"

Last week, they told us there were a few cases of the stomach flu going around in the infant room. We picked up our infant early on Friday to try and reduce his chances of getting it. Well he never got sick (although he had some wetter poop over the weekend but not hardcore diarrhea). Sent him back Monday and has been fine all week. Now all of a sudden, daycare tells us there are multiple cases of the stomach flu going around the entire school, staff, children, parents. Is there any point to picking them up early again in the hopes of them avoiding the bug? Or do we just need to accept that they will probably get sick and just get prepared at this point? 

&amp;#x200B;

Poor babies, the stomach flu is my least favorite and I hate seeing them go through it. It was miserable when my now 2 year old caught it last year."

My son is 11 and had an optometrist appointment on Wednesday where the Dr pointed out that his optic nerve was larger than it should be...I guess inflamed? My husband was at the appointment and doesn't ask many questions and sometimes doesn't relay the best info back, but essentially we were told to seek out a Pediatric Opthalmologist. We're going to CHOP, and they said my son will need to see a neuro ophthalmologist bc it's the optic nerve.

On Wednesday I googled an inflamed optic nerve (wrong thing to do, I know) and I'm getting back returns about MS and so now I'm freaking out.

Can anyone ease my mind? I wasn't ever able to have any more than my son and now there's this little part of me that's always terrified I'm going to lose him and I saw MS and I've been extremely stressed out ever since. We have an appointment at the end of May and I need to have something logical to hold on to for when my mind wanders to the darkness.

Thanks in advanced, I hope this is the right place for this."

We had a well child appointment this week and the doctor expressed a concern about their height since they have started puberty recently but have had no growth spurts - just staying on a slow and steady path. 

She did a bone age test (results are consistent with chronological age) and wants them to see a pediatric endocrinologist to see what options we have.

wickerocker	2021-04-23 13:30:49+00:00	3-year-old only wants physical affection when his sister is getting it	"Not really sure what to do here, if anything. Our 3-year-old (4 in a couple months) is very sweet, but has reached that age where he pushes us away when we go to kiss him while saying “yuck!” and that sort of thing. I know this is totally normal and sometimes I can sneak some snuggles in when he is sleepy.

Well, we also have a 1-year-old daughter who is still very snuggly, plus we breastfeed 2-3 times a day still. So besides just the random cuddles all throughout the day, she also gets some set snuggle sessions as well.

Now, as expected, there is some jealousy between my two kids and I feel like we handle it pretty well. The only thing that I am struggling with is that my son will have zero interest in getting any attention from me *UNTIL* he sees or hears me giving affection to my daughter. Then he races over while making a loud, attention-grabbing noise and tries to forcibly shove his way in between us. He will say things like, “Mama I want a hug!” or “Mama be a horse!” or whatever. And I think I should point out that he isn’t being sweet or snuggly when he does these things. Instead he scrambles up on the couch and then leaps onto my back with his arms wrapped around my neck to the point that it throws me off balance. Or I may be holding up my daughter while she stands and my son will shove his way between us to the point that I can’t hold her up.

I used to be more passive and conversational with my responses (like, “Sweetie, you’ll hurt your sister, please stop,”) and trying to gently stop him until my son was just flat-out fighting me one day and made me spill hot coffee everywhere. So, now I am immediately firm to the point of yelling. As soon as he starts to come towards us and I can see in his eyes what he is doing I just hold up my hand and firmly, loudly, say “No.” Now he sees this as a challenge to try harder. At this point I have to basically stand up, grab my daughter, and leave the room for my son to stop sometimes (not all the time, but enough to be a problem). I’ve had to choose which child to catch before because I was trying to hold on to my daughter and my son was just being absolutely wild while I kept saying “Stop it right now!” 

Now, I should note that almost two years ago my son broke his arm in this kind of a situation and nothing has changed in his attitude despite us trying lots of things. The situation was that my husband was playing with our son and some other kids that were taking turns jumping into my husband’s arms and my son did not wait and ended up falling and landing on his arm. I know he wasn’t mentally capable at the time of really understanding the idea of taking turns and so we have worked A LOT on safety, waiting your turn, etc. At the playground he is an absolute gem and won’t do anything he feels unsafe doing! But at home, all bets are off. I mean, I get it. At the playground he has other kids to play with and isn’t counting on me for attention or fun.

I set aside time every day for us to spend one-on-one and we do some preschool homeschool stuff. I feel confident that my son is getting A LOT of attention and definitely getting my undivided attention every day. My husband and I (we take turns) read books before nap and bedtime every night with just him and we offer physical affection many, many times during the day. I am a SAHM and my husband works from home most days, and even then he is usually not locked up in the office. 

It’s becoming infuriating, to be honest. I know he is little and this is normal and all that, but I’m not being the mom I want to be because I am having to yell at him to get off of me before we all get hurt and then coming back ten minutes later to say, “Ok now we can do a piggy back ride” only to have him say, “Nah...I don’t want one anymore.” So yeah, I’m just jaded now after over a year of this and getting to where I can feel myself tense up when my son comes towards me while I have my daughter because 9/10 times he is coming over to battle for my attention for the 127th time today. 🤦‍♀️ 

Help.

Tl;Dr: my 3-year-old son rejects attention and affection until he sees/hears me loving on his 1-year-old sister, at which point he comes running so that he can try to forcibly prevent me from giving his sister attention and give it to him instead. I am tired."
jocelynpenelope	2021-04-23 13:24:01+00:00	Meals taking FOREVER	"Ok I know this is a totally normal thing for her developmental age, but my 4-year old daughter takes FOREVER to eat a meal and it’s driving me INSANE. She will easily take 45 minutes to eat a simple breakfast in the mornings, and will still be sitting at the dinner table for over an hour after everyone else has finished their meal. We loosely follow the Satter method of feeding in that I truly don’t care how much she eats, so if she says she’s done or her tummy’s full, regardless of how much she’s eaten, then that’s ok with us- so it’s not like I’m forcing her to sit there until her plate is clean (although we do have the house rule that she must try at least 1 bite of every item on her plate). But I have to constantly remind her to sit in her chair, to eat her food, is she done eating? No? THEN EAT YOUR FOOD. Seeing her brother finish his meal and get to go play doesn’t phase her or speed her up at all. If I left her to her own devices, she’d probably take 3 hours to eat a meal and that’s just not conducive to life when we have to get to work/school/daycare in the mornings, and have to get through bathtime/bedtime after dinner. 

So what do I do here? Any advice would be appreciated!"

I've asked several people about it and I have gotten mixed opinions, but a few people have commented that they worry he isn't getting enough supervision at daycare. He has also been bit a handful of times in the past few months there as well.

He doesn't bite at home, so it is hard to really correct the behavior since we aren't seeing it happen. 

In general, I love his daycare. He is excited at drop off and pick up and the communication has be great (due to Covid rules I don't actually see any interaction in the daycare room - just drop him off at the door).

So, any advice? Reassurance that it doesn't make me an awful parent to have a kid who bites? Thoughts if we should start looking into a new child care situation?"
6christian	2021-04-23 12:37:53+00:00	Is this disrespectful?	"Hey Everyone,

Just a random question. For some background, my wife's family is Russian and her mom speaks perfect english. 

My wife's mom has expressed multiple times that she thinks our 10 month old son should learn Russian, and we have both told her we are not interested in teaching him Russian. My wife learned Russian before english and had to do ESL classes in school to learn how to speak English correctly.

Whenever we bring our son over to my wife's mom's house or she speaks with him over the phone, she will speak in Russian to him.

To me I think that if we told her that we don't want to teach him Russian and she speaks perfect english, there is no reason for her to speak to him in Russian.

Does this make sense or am I being ridicolous?

TIA!"

She is fine with friends or people she knows but will often hide or need to warm up even to people she does know. We feel this is especially important since she will be starting Kindergarten in the fall in a whole new school and with a new group of children.

This is especially true in group activities like dance and soccer. She often breaks down and will clamp on to us like we were trying to throw her into an active volcano. We've tried all sorts of things (including some things we probably shouldn't have) to get her to join the group but she still fights it.

kinghippo79	2021-04-23 11:22:27+00:00	"3 yo won’t sleep through the night, is my approach bad?"	"My 3 yo has been waking up and throwing tantrums and whining. I try to calm her but nothing works; sometimes she says “go away!” or “stop talking to me!” or leaves the bed and throws her self around the floor and the chair in her room. 

When she tells me to go away I tell her ok, I’ll be right outside when you need me and she’ll yell “no! don’t leave” or when she says stop talking I say ok, let me know when you want to use your words to tell me what’s wrong and then she’ll yell “nooo, I want to talk” but then proceeds to start the tantrum cycle all over again when I’m listening. 

The only thing I found that works sometimes is if I tell her, if you keep this up then we’re not going to the park tomorrow or we’re not going to the playground on Friday. I only use this when she’s throwing herself around the room and tantruming hard.. at this point I’m pretty much at my limit with patients and running on little to no sleep. 

Tldr; 3yo wake up tantruming/whining, after trying calming techniques only thing that works is telling her no playground the next day if she doesn’t stop.

My question is: is it bad to punish this behavior by taking stuff away?"

Iwanttosleep8hours	2021-04-23 09:20:20+00:00	My neighbours are harassing because of my kids	"I need to vent to people who will understand what it is like with young children so forgive me for the long post. 

Back story: I live in an apartment which I have owned for 7 years, we moved abroad for a couple of years but moved back due to covid affecting my husbands business and I needed to get a job. While we were living abroad we rented it to a nice family with two kids however part way into their tenancy they requested to leave due to the people living downstairs harassing them because their kids were making noise. Then covid hit so we didn’t manage to rent it out and eventually decided we needed to move back.

Anyway, the first few months were fine. My husband is often away abroad so it is just me and the kids. One afternoon we got a long letter through our door telling us to stop making so much noise. Obviously I am not going to say we are quiet because we have kids. So I went downstairs to apologise, try to understand what noise was bothering them, understand what times they are home etc. As soon as the door was answered I got a mountain of abuse calling me a bad mother, telling me I have to move, saying my kids are out of control, how I need to take the kids out the whole day (we were in lockdown at the time), and how I was so inconsiderate. It was an awful exchange and I just stood there kinda shocked.

My daughter is just a toddler so she will make noise like she cries a lot but I can’t really help that. They are in childcare from 8-6 anyway and are always in bed by 7:30 so it is not as if they are up all hours. My neighbours also play drill music all the time really loudly both during the day and at night, often waking up my daughter from her nap. I know the noise they are talking about because above us is also a family and I hear the noise they make but that is the cost of living in a flat. I know the reason they are targeting me is because I am a woman with kids which makes me vulnerable. There is another person in my block who plays music insanely loud with his windows open late at night on weekends and there has never been an attack on him.

After that I they started doing weird stuff, they have their granddad over often and if we are outside while he is he will stand there and stare, it is really unsettling. My husband said hello to him the other day and he stopped, turned around, and said in the most creepy voice “why hello there”.  Anytime we walk past them they are so hostile and they have made it so ridiculously unpleasant living here.

Which brings me onto today. I left to go pick up my son from school and caught the woman gossiping about me to my other neighbour. I just ignored them and went about my day but I was pretty upset why someone has basically made us their enemies when they don’t know us. 

Anyway, after I put the kids to bed I was cleaning up after dinner. I have an exterior fire door and an interior door which is the entrance of my flat and I heard someone open the exterior door. I forgot to lock the door since I was dragging in two exhausted children, two bags, two water bottles into my flat and I heard the interior door start to open. I immediately went to the door when they heard me and immediately opened the exterior door and literally ran down the stairs and back into their flat. I didn't manage to open the door fast enough to see who it was but I heard their door slam so it was obviously their flat. I think the speed which they ran into their flat alarms me the most because obviously they were planning something bad.

After the initial shock I wanted to cry, I am on my own with two kids and I felt so unsafe. I have no idea what they are doing or what they had planned. I also have no proof it was them and it wasn’t like them came inside so I feel like even if I did get the police involved there is nothing they would be able to do and it will just make it so much worse. I ordered a camera with motion sensor which I will install today so at least if they do it again I will have proof."

sttaylor07	2021-04-23 08:32:53+00:00	"Febrile Seizure - Not Looking for Advice, just Solidarity I guess"	"My daughter turned one last week and had her 12 month vaccines. One of these was the MMRV, and I was told she could spike a fever 7-10 days later. Well last night at 1:30 am, she woke up screaming and sure enough, she had a fever. We gave her Tylenol and put her back to bed. All through the next day, we monitored, gave Tylenol as needed, and gave her fluids. Tried to make her day as normal as possible. 

Tonight, we put her to bed at 7:00 and she was asleep pretty quick. I went to take a bath around 8:30 I think to unwind from the day. At 9:45, I was done, and was getting up to shower. I checked her on the monitor, she was fine, and I decided to do a quick shower and then go check her temp. I closed the shower curtain, started the shower, and as I was waiting for it to warm up, I peeked out a the monitor again and my baby was seizing. I’ve never moved so fast in my life, and I honestly don’t know how I didn’t fall on the slippery floor. I bolted to her room, dripping wet, and rolled her onto her side and waited. Fortunately, I’ve read up on febrile seizures before so I knew what to do. However, it was the most terrifying moment of my life and I stood there watching my baby seize, not knowing if she was about to die. She was making strange noises, and I didn’t have my phone near me to get my husband who was in the basement, way too far away to hear me. 

She probably only seized for about 20 seconds, but it felt so much longer. I picked her up when I was sure she was done, and she was completely limp, but conscious and breathing. We ended up going to the hospital, got told we were right and it was a febrile seizure, and to just keep an eye on her. 

Now it’s 2:30 am and I’m watching her sleep on the monitor and my stomach just drops every time she moves because I’m so afraid of another seizure. I know the odds, and I know she probably won’t have another one within 24 hours,  but that she could very well have another one in her life. I’m so scared that she’d have one while we are sleeping and choke. 

Basically, I’m terrified now, and I don’t know what to do. So I’m looking for solidarity or something...just someone to help me feel better. 

TL;DR my baby had her first febrile seizure tonight and now I’m too scared to sleep and stop watching her. Help me feel better?"
no-more-sleep	2021-04-23 08:22:28+00:00	8 year old recently started putting toys in his mouth	"Our 8 year old is neurotypical and has no developmental issues. He hit all the milestones on time. He stopped putting toys in his mouth around age 3 as normal.

Then recently, at age 8, he's been putting toys in his mouth such as rubber/silicone bracelets. The other day I found him with some small plastic toy parts in his mouth and scolded him because they were definitely choking hazards.

I could almost understand if he never outgrew the toys in mouth habit since childhood, but he stopped at age 3 and only restarted recently at age 8. He's even asked for a pacifier.

Is this something to be concerned about? Should I really get him a pacifier? Or maybe a mouthguard instead? I'm not sure if I should get him to stop putting things in his mouth, or give him safer non-choking alternatives."

· Yelled a lot

· I cried a lot

· He’d yell at me for crying

· He’d yell at me for saying I was yelling

· Didn’t trust me, I remember him asking if I was lying a lot

· He’d drive really fast and take sharp turns when he was mad at us

· I remember at least once where Nicolas and him were arguing in what’s now my room and then there was banging and Nicolas screaming. Nicolas might’ve been being dramatic, but still

· The most useful thing he ever taught me was how to get the last bit of toothpaste out of a roll of toothpaste. He showed me how to change oil on a car once, but jiffylube does that for free

· In general, never instilled any values or lessons in me

· Didn’t spend any time with me

· I mean we went fishing a couple times, we played poker when I was little, he was the assistant coach on my soccer team for like half a season, but he stopped cause his ego got in the way when I called him the assistant coach because he didn’t know as much about soccer as coach bob and coach bob had been the coach for the past several years, so he was kinda the assistant coach

· I listen to podcasts where the host has a new person on every show and the first thing he does is pretty much ask questions through their life story and I always hear about how large of a part their father played in their life. This figure that encouraged them and taught them and loved them and I don’t think I ever had that

· Went drinking on Nicolas’ birthday. Nicolas is a shut in, family is all that he has and it was his fucking birth day

· When I was in the hospital he told me not to let it happen again because it was costing him a lot of money

· Made fun of the way I talked

· I feel like I recall him saying he was ashamed to be my father and in general just lots of awful things to say to a child

· Abusive in all ways but physical, supportive in no ways but financial, but that just means you could replace him with a large enough check

· So he was a piece of shit for most of my childhood, he was a piece of shit to me during the hardest year of my life. What else could I possibly need him for? Not only has he not been a good father to me, but if he couldn’t do it at either of those times, I don’t think he’s capable of being a good father

· He’s failed me as a father"
OmniAeternalis_97	2021-04-23 06:55:55+00:00	A question for parents from a teenager	"I honestly don’t need to be thinking about this, I’m 15. I do wonder if I even want children though, and I know that sometimes I feel this deep longing to devote myself completely to a child, and to raise a kid in a healthy home. Often times I imagine myself in a situation as an adult where my kid does something stupid or makes a mess or gets scared and I’m able to work through the issue in a calm, quiet manner that makes that kid smile and feel supported rather than feel threatened. Does that sound egotistical? I say all this because I’m worried that adopting a child to raise, even with a husband who I hope will be there, will require I give up some measure of my individuality. I have hobbies and passions I care about, some require money and all require time. I suppose I will know I’m ready to spare parts of myself when I feel a child is something (someone) who I would give up everything for. Is that how I will know? Am I thinking selfishly? I wonder if I could be happy like that, or even with the responsibility of a life. Just tell me your thoughts on all that. I know I don’t even need to think about it, but it crosses my mind from time to time and there’s no harm in having a conversation."

Hes 5 weeks and we CANNOT put him in the snoo and he is more fussy than before. 

We are considering returning it but I'm hoping he calms down and I can use it.

Had anyone had a colicky baby and used the snoo? 

What worked If you did?"
avgfem	2021-04-23 05:24:36+00:00	I think my 18 month old is ready for potty training.........HELP ME PLS	"I want to preface this by saying that I am a certified ECE teacher that has NEVER had to deal with potty training so I am clueless and nervous lol.

So my 18 month old son has been showing some signs (that I googled) of being ready for potty training like hiding when he poops, keeping dry diapers for a lot longer (they really only become soiled when he naps cause he doesn’t have control at that point), ripping his diaper off if it is dirty, and wanting to follow myself or his dad to the bathroom.

I’m kind of lost on how to move forward with this. I’ve bought a toilet for him to start practice using. He’s smaller than the average 18mo (like 5th percentile) so trying to put him on the actual toilet seems dangerous since he would fall right through if he doesn’t hold himself up. He’s somewhat interested in his toilet though. I’ve gotten him to sit on it when I’m in the bathroom. And I’ve tried a couple times with getting him to use the bathroom in it but he won’t. He has clear tell-tale signs of when he needs to use the bathroom so that’s when I say “hey, let’s go use the toilet” and I sit him on it but nothing.

What tips and tricks do you have for potty training? What worked for you and what didn’t? I know all kids are different but I’d love to hear others experiences of potty training, especially with a child who is ready for it at a younger stage in their toddler years."

Divorced dad and my daughter is at the stage of her life where changes are going to begin happening soon.  I'm comforted by the fact that she is openly talking with me about it and asking questions.  I've mostly just listened so far, answered basic questions, and asked her some questions of my own.  I need to be more prepared.  Can any of you recommend any websites, books, literature, etc?  I know I can Google and get answers, but how do I know good advice from bad?  For her sake I need not screw this up.  I can only imagine some of the changes will be tough enough for her as it is."
miikkamillie	2021-04-23 04:30:39+00:00	Kids &amp; IPads	"Backstory here, I have a 4 month old and 4 year old. We just pulled our son from preschool due to a covid-19 scare and we aren’t wanting to continue isolating and testing continuously. 

I fully admit I am learning how to juggle 2 children, but I have an immense amount of guilt when I allow my son to watch his iPad. He watches anywhere between 1-2 hours a day. (Not consecutively) 

Do you allow your child to watch iPad/tv? Do you feel guilty? (Even if it’s misplaced guilt) How long do you allow them to watch? 

Sincerely,

Exhausted Mom"
GambinosDisciple	2021-04-23 04:19:44+00:00	Loss of attitude towards sport	"Covid has hit my kid hard. He gained weight, and has become overly invested in videogames. Ive been handling it well, something that has really helped has been the inclusion of screen time limits for videogames and what not.

My kid is pretty talented at soccer. Currently plays in one of the if not the best academy for his age. He was never a regular starter, but he had an important role in the team before lock down. Lock down came, and thus took soccer for some time. He started integrating himself again for about 2 months now. Not a bit of talent was lost, but a whole lot of attitude was gone. 

I assume this has been because of his other growing interest in videogames, he just dosen't prioritize sport as he use to, and their is nothing wrong with that, if he wants to quit so be it, but he tells me he still likes soccer, hes just being mediocre.

Anyways, this lack of attitude has taken a toll on him and set him back to playing with kids of a lower level, and in all honesty, it sadens me to see his potential go to waste.

So, I come here for advice... How can I encourage him to put in the extra work? Should I advice him to talk to his coach? Should I talk with his coach? What do I say?"
rikkilynn23	2021-04-23 03:51:46+00:00	"Daughter found an adult toy, how do I approach this?!"	"Today we messed up... I was having a bad headache and my SO asked my daughter to go grab the bottle of Tylenol on top of his bedside table. Normally our daughter (9) is forbidden from our room, so she decided to take the opportunity to look in my SO’s bedside table. My daughter is obsessed with pink, so of course the first thing she notices is the bright pink adult toy hidden in the bedside table. When we later went to bed it was just laying in the middle of our floor. 

My SO went to ask her if she had gone through our table and she responded that she did, and that she just wanted to look at the “pink thing” because it looked interesting.. he just reminded her not to go through his things and left it at that. 

My question now is how do we handle this. It’s very obviously phallic shaped, and she knows that boys have different shaped genitalia, so she must be confused. Do I just leave it or should we come up with an explanation? Though my daughter knows basic biology and about certain aspects of reproduction. I’ve never gone far enough to explain sex and I don’t feel she’s old enough or mature enough yet. She’s a very whimsical child and still believes in fairies and magic. I have no idea how to approach this if I should approach it at all. Anyone have any advice or similar experience?"

ilariad92	2021-04-23 03:43:33+00:00	I wish my daughter didn’t have to grow up and see the world for how it really.	"I wish I could shield her from all the hate and pain people cause. If I could, I would have her live in a world where people aren’t so corrupt and evil. She doesn’t deserve all the negativity and heartbreak that lies ahead of her. I wish people weren’t so cold hearted and indifferent. It hurts me to know that one day she will feel the sting of rejection and disapproval from others. I just wish I could keep her away from all that. 

However, I know that wouldn’t true be life. We can’t truly appreciate the good without the bad. I just don’t want her to hurt. Ever. Because in my eyes, she doesn’t deserve it. Honestly, no child does. As parents, all we can do is be there for them when they do see the world for how it really is. Wishing we could go back to when they saw the world as a beautiful and happy place."
mummy-bear	2021-04-23 03:31:40+00:00	Upset about daughter	We brought our adult 19yr old daughter up in a loving good home gave her everything.  Since been a teenager all her morals have changed she swears is disrespectful tells her friends lies that we are awful parents she scams family and friends for money so she doesnt have to get a job. She rarely calls only if she wants something. She never even contacts he brother or sister. She is addicted to her phone. When she lived at home if we took it off her at night she would be violent attack at us. She quit uni. She hangs out with negative people. She always plays the victim mentality.  She recently told me her friend is a prostitute but swear mum im not..i dont believe her she lies now.  I feel so sad. I never thought she would grow to be this personality. She was a beautiful child. It makes me so depressed.
slychikenfry15	2021-04-23 03:23:34+00:00	Non-stop talker/ ADHD	"I have a lovely 5yr old boy who since the age of 2.5 has NEVER stopped talking.  He will talk to anyone about anything. 
He recently started TBall and I've noticed during practice he constantly makes comments to the coach, some are borderline rude. We correct him each time and even tried making games out of seeing how long he can go without having to ""have the last word"". I know it can be very annoying to deal with a kid that doesn't know how to be quiet and try to gently encourage better behavior but on the other hand I don't want to make him feel insecure or like he isn't likeable.
On another note at his mid term kindergarten teacher meeting she mentioned that he has trouble sitting still and while it was still early we should watch for ADHD.
Other than his non-stop talking and extra energy he is a pretty normal kid. He makes friends with everyone, follows rules, is no more impulsive than any 5yr old, and seems pretty on par for emotion control.
Has anyone had experience with this and their kid was not ADHD? Any tips or advice for curbing his talking?"

Did you know that Caillou parent's names are Doris and Boris. I have a theory they are twins in an incest marriage. Caillou is an incest baby and that explains his shit attitude. If the family tree is a circle and their grandparents are related, that explains their colorblind and their shit taste in furniture.

Kaitlin138	2021-04-23 02:38:51+00:00	Why are people obsessed with meat culture? Why is this a thing!? Live and let eat!	"Here's my rant...my MIL has started making comments to/around my 2 year old about eating meat. But not just eating meat, but being obnoxiously pro-meat and anti-anything else. She'll say things like ""I love you more than bacon!"" or ""yeah, a good man eats his meat!"" (The last one is funny, I know). First off, I'm not even vegetarian. We're straight up omnivores in our household. But I see nothing wrong with people eating whatever healthy diet that they choose, whether it be for moral/health/religious reasons. I'm not eating it! Why should I care? To go along with it, there's a strong anti-vegetarian sentiment in their (my MIL/FIL's) household, despite the fact that my SIL is vegetarian. So every holiday gathering (remember when those were a thing?) we are subjected to comments about the tofurky or how ""that stuffing wasn't cooked in the turkey, that's the yucky one"". My own sister is vegan and was vegetarian before that for over 20 years. I've seen the shit she's had to put up with because she feels that this diet is right for her. It's just so fucked up. I'm not trying to raise any kind of bully."
thelizzyparable	2021-04-23 02:33:31+00:00	So frustrated with my mom!	"My daughter will be 4 on May 10th. She is very prone to Strep throat and also has obstructive sleep apnea. She had a sleep study done back in February, and she's stopping breathing a lot in her sleep and her oxygen is staying around 93-94 while she sleeps. 
She's been on the wait list to have a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy at the children's hospital in the city. My mom knew this and was going to be our babysitter for our 5 year old. She said she would set aside the time off to keep our son for the 2 days that our daughter is in the hospital. The hospital called today and scheduled her surgery for April 28th, next Wednesday. I called my mom and she says she can't keep my son. That she doesn't have the days. She told me I couldn't be mad or frustrated at her, and she blamed it on leaving work early 2 weeks ago when my house got robbed. While I was thankful she watched the kids that day, we didn't ask her to. She showed up at our house after my dad called her without even talking to me. 

This surgery has been on the table for months now and she is all I have to rely on. My husband and I don't go on dates, hardly ever do we not have our kids, and I just really needed her. My husband is talking about not coming to the surgery so he can stay home with our son, but that's not fair to our daughter. Also, my sister, her husband, and their 5 month old baby are flying in from across the country on May 18th and my mom has already taken off days to be with them even though she just flew up in January to see the baby. It's just really frustrating. My whole life, my mom has picked my siblings over me. Something else has always been more important, and now history is repeating itself with my kids. 

Sorry if this seems whiney, just really irritated."
Zealousideal-Field74	2021-04-23 01:49:02+00:00	Party Question	"I realize this is a silly trivial question but I was hoping to get some input from more experienced parents. 

I haven’t been to many kids parties. We’re having a birthday for my 4 yr old at a playground and expecting 15-20 kids and their parents. There will also be some family / friends there without kids. 

The playground location should be entertaining enough but we’re also considering hiring someone to do games/activities with the kids (good idea? Necessary?) The entertainer requires a 1 hr minimum.  If we do hire him, the party start time is 11 so we would have him from 11:30-12:30 and then serve lunch at 12:30. Do you think it’s too late to make people wait an hour and a half from the 11am start time to the 12:30 lunch time? Too long of a wait for food for the guests?

Again I know this is trivial but like everyone else I’ve been in hibernation for the past year and apparently forgot what’s appropriate at a party."

Would it be weird to drop off a small care package, and include our numbers in case they needed anything? I don’t know anything about their diet etc .. but what could I put in it?

shamonya_throaway	2021-04-23 01:02:05+00:00	My son wants to wear a skirt and we aren't ready.	"For background, he's (they're?) 12 and their mom and I split when there were little. I'm married and she's married and we split custody. I get my child on weekends. The kids identifies as gay and non-binary. 

Anyways, my kid has been cutting and never attempted suicide that we know of but has told the therapist that he has a plan for how to do it. After a week in a psychiatric ward that he was very receptive to and volunteered to go, everything was great. Normal kid stuff. 

They stayed with mom after their time in psych, then I went and got them and we had a great weekend. I took them to the mall and give them a 50 to do whatever with.  

We went to hot topic and I was thinking we were there for the cool pop culture stuff because their clothes suck but they have neat Harry Potter and anime stuff or whatever. My kid bought a skirt. Like a black schoolgirl skirt with a chain on it. And I texted mom and told her and she's like NO! and I'm like idk dude we're already at the register paying I'm just giving you a heads up. 

Then he bought a bucket hat. Like... I can't make sense of where his mind is. Idk. Idc. 

Fast forward, I come home from work the next day and they're walking around the house in an outfit built around the skirt, I tell them we're going to a party, they get changed into sweats and we head out. Super fun night, super fun weekend.

On the hour long drive to mom I tell them, mom isn't ready to see you in a skirt and honestly I'm not either. They nod and that's that. 24 hours later he's readmitted to the psych ward because that started cutting and planning to hang themselves. Because mom said she isn't ready. 

I'm at a lost like what is this? I'm sorry for the block of text and formatting but we're lost in this. Idk what to do what to say how to handle this. I just want my little boy back and they're becoming an entirely new person like overnight."

RocksGrowHere	2021-04-23 00:50:43+00:00	SAHMing and mismatched parenting responsibilities	"I want to start by saying, I know that I’m coming from a place of privilege. I’m grateful to be able to stay at home with my kids; we plan to homeschool, so it’s always been the plan, as I’m a trained teacher, so daycare would have taken up my whole salary. I’m so grateful for my husband’s job, especially throughout covid. 

But I feel like being a SAHM, according to my husband, means that the majority of the childcare and household responsibilities, including things like paying bills, scheduling appointments, planning and buying birthday gifts, all of that falls to me.  My husband is a “fun” dad, so he needs just as much directions as my kids do sometimes. 

The major point of contention right now is after work childcare. He is frustrated with me because he has to watch the kids in the evening while I run errands, he sees it like I’m just going shopping for fun. We don’t take the kids anywhere unnecessarily because of covid, so I don’t take them during the day. Plus, grocery shopping with small kids is the *worst*. 

Other stay at home parents, how do you all divide childcare and household responsibilities?"
RedDeadJunkie	2021-04-23 00:34:46+00:00	My 14 month old daughter seems to like daycare more than at home. Any advice?	" 

Background here: My 14 month old daughter seems to hate my wife and I since she started to go to daycare about 3 weeks ago. She goes Monday-Friday from about 9-4:30/5 She loves it when we bring her there but as soon as she is at home before or after daycare she is extremely unhappy. My wife and I have tried everything but she gets unhappy as soon as we do anything with her.

Try to feed her, she will refuse to go in her chair for awhile and then won’t eat until we leave her alone.

Go on the ground in her play area/room, she throws herself on the ground and cries all over us

Put her down for a nap, she wakes up as mad as she was before

Take her on walks, she will be complacent for awhile but eventually will cry

Give her snacks and drink: she just throws it on the ground or slaps it away

The only thing that makes her happy is holding and waking around with her for hours on end.

The daycare is fantastic, they have cameras there and we see her having a blast. They take constant pictures and they constantly tell us how “wonderful and how surprising it is that she adjusted so well”

That’s awesome and I’m so happy she loves it at daycare and learning and all but my wife and I are at wits end and we do not know what to do anymore.

Any tips? We would love any tips"

As companies start calling up their employees to return to the office later this year, will they consider parents of newborns and toddlers who do not have a vaccine available to their babies yet? Parents can get the vaccine but we know that doesn't mean that we cannot transmit the virus if we were to get it, so we still have to be careful to not spread the virus even if we are protected from the symptoms."

notreallyanengineer	2021-04-23 00:08:40+00:00	Trouble dealing with my Mother in Law	"I'm looking for advice about a recent situation regarding my mother in law. On Easter Sunday, my wife, my two boys (2 and 5), and I went over to the in laws for Easter dinner.  Everything went well.  When we got home we received a call from my father in law that my mother in law had a slight fever.  Come to find out that my mother in law had been having minor symptoms since the prior Thursday but did not let us know nor had she had the vaccine despite being eligible for a few months.  We asked her to take a covid test which came back positive. My family went into quarantine mode for the next ten days and my wife and I got tested every 2-3 days. My brother in law and father in law tested positive 3 days later.  I tested positive on day 10.  This triggered 10 days off of work for me.  My wife began showing symptoms about 5 days later and tested positive. I will have to go back to work soon and my kids will not be done with their quarantines by the time I have to go back.  I asked my mother in law if she would be able to help with the kids while I am gone but she has said that she is far too busy.  She has a part time job as a tennis pro and does not actually need to work to support her household. My wife will now need to take vacation to stay home with the kids.  

Am I wrong for being pretty upset about this?  I know we shouldn't have been seeing family until we were fully vaccinated but I think some of the fault is hers.  How should I handle this situation? How can we express our feelings without making the situation worse? Thanks."

Only to have to take time off work to wipe a dirty ass hole and breast feed daily, and give up sleep and sanity in return. The reason there is a gender wage gap is due to women becoming parents. Thanks patriarchy! 
I see so many women complain about how they have to do all of the child care, house chores, cooking and some even also work. Even good men who are committed still don’t do the bulk of the work. 

Why ladies, why choose this route? I will never understand why any woman would want this for herself.

“Oh you’ll never experience love like you do with your own child.”

1. I am not that desperate for love
2. Please learn to love yourself that much instead 
3. I’m sorry you feel like the only true love out there is through reproduction

Women, you are causing your own suffering by following gender norms and having kids.

Save yourselves! The planet is dying because we keep reproducing."

Rationally I know that a lot of autistic behaviors and traits are somewhat just where they are “frozen” developmentally yet everytime I see something I worry that it’s autism. 

I work with autistic children in a group home residential setting. I know the importance of early intervention and how much of a difference it can make. But I struggle to remind myself that some things that I see at work are developmentally normal in infants/toddlers. 

Currently it’s that when she pulls herself to stand or tries to take steps she tries to walk on her top toes or even almost on the tops of her feet with her toes curled under. And I remind myself everyday I do not need to call the doctor to get into early therapies yet, this is normal in toddlers learning to walk and that I can bring it up at her appointment in a month if I’m concerned. 

Not sure what the real point of this post was just need to put the words into the universe. Anyone else work with children (or adults) on the spectrum and do the same things?"

He was sent home today from school for what turned out to be pink eye. So we now have to give him eye drops 3 times a day both eyes for a few days. The first dose absolutley broke my heart and I know there has to be a better way. I asked our Dr while we were there and she didn't seem to follow along at all with what I was asking. We tried it her way once he got home and my little man was in tears. I asking please share tips,tricks, and advice. Thanks in advance."
MarkCharacter5050	2021-04-22 23:08:22+00:00	How much technology time are other teenagers getting?	"My almost 14 year old son, our oldest of 3 boys, is convinced that my wife and I are being unreasonably controlling about his computer and technology time. We have intentionally limited our kids use of television to only weekends, which includes switch and Xbox. They will get a movie during school nights every so often. 

He has an iPhone that turns on at 7:15 am and shuts off at 9:30 pm. Apple Screen Time is a joke of a software, but it does shut down apps at the time it’s supposed to. He also does not have safari or any browser on his phone. (Not that he can’t get to a browser otherwise, ie screen time sucks and you can open safari through gmail app). He also uses a laptop for homework, to voice chat on discord and will sometimes be allowed to play Minecraft after his homework is done. 

I feel like the limitations we’ve put on technology are reasonable for a 14 year old. But I would love to hear how other parents have limited their teenagers use of tech and what they think of our process."
AngelHoneyGoldfish	2021-04-22 23:01:59+00:00	Nap advice- won’t stay in bed	"My toddler has always been a fantastic sleeper. Lately, she has been refusing her nap and continuously comes out of her room. I put her back, she comes out. I put her back, she comes out. Repeat x forever.

I know that if I’m consistent, she will understand. But it’s been 2 hours now of me putting her back repeatedly and her naps are only 1-2 hours. 

I’m worried that if I let her “get her way”, she will learn that she just has to keep getting out of bed constantly until she can finally stay. But I also can’t keep putting her back and make her stay in her room all day because she won’t nap.

Advice please- I’m losing my sanity."

SheWillNeverBeMe	2021-04-22 22:35:07+00:00	Approaching daughter's boyfriend of his intentions	"So here is my situation: my daughter and her boyfriend have been together 4 years and have lived together for 3.5 years. They are very compatible and get along well and have a lot in common. She is in her late 20's, he is mid 20's  She moved across the country when he took a different job in fact.  They are more then financially stable. My question is this- she wants to get married and he doesn't appear to even have this on his radar.  He knows she does, but seems to make excuses that he is scared he will fail resulting in a divorce like his parents did.  I find this a huge cop out.  I am worried that she is wasting her time waiting on him.  Most of her friends are all getting married and starting families and this devastates her being that she wants the same.  
I really wish that there was a way to approach him and point blank ask what his intentions are with our daughter.  If anything I would be happy with some sort of show of commitment (engagement) as would she.  Thank you for any input."
jeldim	2021-04-22 22:26:08+00:00	Timing daycare start w/ COVID shots	"So, I'm the mom of a 2 year old and after 13 months of keeping her at home while I WFH, I'm finally sending her back to daycare part time (so I'll have 3 kid-free work days and workdays with her home with me, which feels like a good balance for me). During the work week she would be in daycare Monday-Wednesday and home Thursday-Friday. The plan was for her to start May 3.

Anyways, next Monday (April 26) I have my 2nd Pfizer shot scheduled for myself and Tuesday (April 27) my husband is getting his 2nd Pfizer shot. I had originally planned on starting my daughter in daycare the following week (Monday, May 3) but was told by the daycare director that she could start as early as Monday, April 26.

So, for those who have had the 2nd Pfizer shot: if you were in my shoes would you start her a week earlier than planned so someone else could watch her while you rest off the shot? I was already planning to use my PTO if it hit me really hard, but hadn't considered that it might help to outsource childcare if I'm feeling profoundly crappy even if I'm not working."

I know I need to cut all communication and leave him be but it’s just so hard for me especially seeing him being a father to his other kids. I think it’s hurting me more than the kids. any advice for me to just cut him out from their lives completely? 😔"

I have 4 kids between the ages of 8 years and 8 months. We have been yo-yoing between in person learning and distance/online learning as the province's restrictions have changed over the school year. My oldest child is diagnosed with ADHD, and I am beginning to suspect my second child of having ADHD as well which adds to the challenge. For the last few weeks I have tried to be patient and understanding with my kids about how they are feeling and acting out (small humans with big feelings), but today it was just too much.

The two older ones have been fighting with each other constantly, because well...they only have each other right now, so why not fight to the death all day every day. The toddler (2.5) is working on his last set of molars still so he is a small demon who refuses to sleep and doesn't know his own strength. The baby is well a baby, and 8 months old. 

The 8 year old stopped paying attention and disappeared during the morning lesson which led to him having no idea what was going on during the afternoon lesson and didn't say anything until after the lessons were done for the day. The 6 year old was flat out rude to both her teachers and myself this morning during her morning class. They then woke the baby three times while I was trying to get her down for nap. I finally get the baby and the toddler down for nap and the older two are trying to hurt each other. I snapped and told them to sit in opposite ends of the couch in silence and think about their behaviour and the effect that it has on others. 

The oldest seems to have responded, not sure about the 6 year old. And hubby picked up takeout for dinner so I could have a minute.

Tldr: kids and pandemic schooling drove me crazy. Made the kids sit in silence and reflect. Hubby tried to soothe me with takeout."

The hubby went out to get some work done today and I took out the laptop and somehow ended up on a ""I regret having kids parenting,"" reddit which I now regret. I definitely love my children already but a lot of the posts were about how difficult the first year with babies is  and I guess me and my husband knew that on some level but you can't really know what it's like until it's actually happening. I've just been worried about how to maintain the love in our relationship. Maybe we both need to have a talk about making sure the kids come first for the first year and just fully brace ourselves for that?

(We know about the lack of sleep)."

My 16 yr old is currently at an inpatient facility for suicidal behavior.  He was going to go through with his plan but a friend told a school counselor.  

I didn't see it coming.  I didn't see the signs.  I'm so scared.  He's now diagnosed with severe social anxiety.  He hid it well. 

I'm terrified of bringing him home from the inpatient facility.  We have an outpatient therapist lined up and he is starting medication.

They are pretty much self-directed, so essentially he is reading a lesson and doing assignments/tests with little teacher interaction. I always make myself available to help, but I'm not sure the best way to help. He struggles with concentrating, focusing, is easily distracted. He says the he finds it hard to take in the information when he is reading it. I'm just looking for suggestions of how I can help him, or techniques he can use so that it's not so difficult. He's a smart kid but does so much better when someone is teaching him in person."

Especially if somebody struggles with PPD/PPA , these comments do so so much damage. And everyone’s child is different! just let people enjoy their kids! I just had to rant on this because I see it so many times a day. (And this includes anyone who says those things to pregnant people as well) “say goodbye to sleep” , “say goodbye to your marriage”, “enjoy no peace for 3 years” , “I hope you’re ready for no me time” , “you won’t relax for 5 years”. JUST let people enjoy their kids, parenting is hard, but just because you seem to be so miserable as a parent doesn’t mean everybody else will/has to."

"If you're a parent of an infant, or a toddler like me, you may have come to the realization that mask training is one of the next stages in your child's growth and learning. Due to our current ""situation"", as I like to call it, mask wearing is now a necessity to go about your everyday life. We aren't quite there yet, but I've started my 18 month old with a very relaxed approach to mask training. No schedule or anything like potty training where you ""try"" every so often, or whatever your preference is. We noticed he was interested and would put masks up to his face. So, my motherly instincts kicked in and told me to embrace the interest! We encourage him to practice wearing a mask at home for as long as he wants. We celebrate when he wears it and encourage him to show it off as well. HE LOVES IT!

Tell me your tips and tricks for mask training! Practices that have worked and haven't worked."

I was woken by the fact that I have to schedule my boys for vaccines shortly... and the whole idea of it just stresses me out... their reaction... the crying... the screaming ... their stress. I personally have had a phobia of needles since I was 8-28... started when my mum lied to me saying she was getting tablets from the doctor but I ended up locked in a room to get vaccinated... I remember running and being dragged down the hallway screaming for help. 

Understandably... as a child you don’t fully comprehend vaccinations and that they’re good for you... yes they hurt... and I don’t want to lie to my sons I’m thinking about buying numbing cream for their arms. When they were smaller it was easier. Sort of. It was still very stressful to watch them have to go through that.. while sitting there telling myself “it’s for their own good”.... 

Does anyone have any tips to make things easier??? I might enlist the help of my mum so I’m not wrangling them both alone.. but I also need a bit help in dealing with it. I feel like crying Rn and I know on the day I will cry as well. 

TIA."

My LO was 'walking' along the couch (keeps one hand on the couch and kind of waddles along it)and I could tell he was getting ready to poop so I just let him do his thing for a minute while I finished cleaning the counter. I come around the couch to see him sitting with his back against the couch on the floor so I go to pick him up and his back is COVERED in poop. I tossed him into the tub with the diaper on and everything haha.
Now I am sitting on the floor scrubbing my couch to get it out while he is back to climbing it 💕

deeeelightful	2021-04-22 19:16:37+00:00	Both kids cranky after nap	"We've long accepted that both kids (4-year-old and 18-month-old) are generally just cranky upon waking from their naps. They both sleep really well at night and during nap time, though the 4-year-old only naps one out of every 2-3 days. But when she does sleep, she often gets an hour and a half or more. The point is, I don't think sleep is an issue. And they both wake rather pleasantly in the mornings.       






      






It's just those naps. For the older one, we ""resolved"" this inconsolable crankiness by allowing her to have her allotted TV time immediately after nap. But with the younger one, we're not so excited to give her screen time. Does anyone out there have any ideas for helping this crankiness?!"

My son is struggling a lot with these assignments (he is in the gifted class). He does sometimes have issues with his effort and paying attention but I am observing him paying close attention to the video the entire time.  Usually what winds up happening is he goes through the entire video twice, still can’t answer some of the questions and I wind up having to watch the entire video myself and help him identify the section where the information is given.  As you might guess he gets extremely frustrated by this. 

What do you think?  I feel like these videos need to be broken up and/or time references be given so the kids know where to review."
Illustrious_Egg_12	2021-04-22 18:06:18+00:00	I made a gofundme for my son's surgery and was told by multiple people I'm a scammer...	"So my son needs surgery for Chordee and his very small penis hole.
We discussed options with the doctor as far as cost and payments and they gave me a price.
I recently lost my job and so we can't really even afford the monthly split payments and we have to have it done before October.
So we're saving what we can and I'm doing oddjobs to make up what I can but we're still unsure we can do it.
So I made a gofundme to try to help pay for it, and if no one donates it's no biggie, I just thought it wouldn't hurt to post it.

Now I'm getting messages from people on my NEIGHBORHOOD APP that I'm a scammer, and there's no way I can't afford it, and the doctors would do it for free (where??) Etc etc. I'm feeling very very frustrated atm. I get there are scammers out there but I even sent them pictures of my sons diagnosis from the doctor that clearly stated what needed to be done and the cost and they said I forged it! Ugh!"

It causes me distress every day. It is my main reason for my depression. I have additional deep rooted trauma from it, because I had skin bridges which ate a common side effect from circumcision. I had to get them fixed at 13, and recovery was traumatic for an additional uncessary surgery. I am happy I can still have sex and orgasm, but I have bad scarring on the head of my penis.

I am currently in therapy, and am restoring my foreskin using devices, to bring back some of the lost sensation and pleasure, and so I can look uncircumcised.

I have a few questions:

How would you handle this if your child told you this?
Would you pay for his therapy?
Would you pay for his foreskin restoration devices?
How would you like your child to approach you about this subject?

I love my parents, but I really resent them for this. It's hard because they were great, but it makes me sick they mutilated my genitals without my consent. It is my main reason of trauma.

My wife is supportive of me through this. I am 24 by the way."

"Every morning, my 3 year old son picks up both his and his brother's (twins that share a room) very heavy twin foam mattresses and moves them about their room. He will angle them tallways against the wall to climb up the the top of the closet and unlock it. He does this virtually silently. So every day, twice a day, I have to completely reset their room.

I have bought box frames for them both but am worries this will just be adding ammunition.

Does anyone know a way to connect the mattress to the box fame that that tis is no longer possible? I've looked everywhere and can't seem to find a solution.

My mum came over today and while we were hanging out, the older kids wanted a snack so I grabbed them each a plate of breadsticks, veggies and a spoonful of hummus. 2 of these were served on small side plates and one was served on a plastic peppa pig plate (this plate belongs to one of the younger ones). I literally used this plate because that is what I had to hand.

My mum was horrified to see my 11 year old eating off of this plate. In her words I was ""not respecting him and infantilising him"". All of my kids were saying it is not an issue. My mum carried on saying that they're not babies and I shouldn't treat them like babies. She said she never would have given me that plate at 11 years old.

The thing is, she had 2 kids (me and my sister.) Who were of similar ages and had similar interests. She didnt have 5 kids with such a huge age gap. Also, I'm not going to throw put all of the baby plates when the kids get too old for them anyway. A plate is a plate and there is no need to make an issue of it. 

She told my kids that I was disrespecting them. She told them that if I did something like that again that they should call her. I feel like I am going crazy. I dont get the issue. I dont get why she ruined such a lovely afternoon. I dont think I will ever serve something on that plate again without getting angry. I'm honestly at such a loss."

Both of them sleep well at night. They go down around 7PM and can stretch until around 4AM - and with a little coaching stretch another couple hours until 6AM.

During the day though, I’m going nuts. Their schedule is basically 6AM, 9AM, 11AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM and 630PM. They eat for about 30 minutes, play for another 30-60 minutes, and then take a nap of about 30-45 minutes. Sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less.

Is this normal? They tend to take around 5oz with each feed, although rarely 4oz and sometimes more like 6-7oz. They’re gaining weight and growing just fine - maybe that is most important - but the schedule is hard to keep up with.

Any thoughts or help appreciated. They’re also teething right now FWIW"

My mother-in-law quit her job when we had our little, in order to care for her grandbabies. (She was a SAHM while raising her kids, and only worked after all three were in school). When we first discussed it, she did not want us to pay her, and she has never brought money up. 

But *I* feel guilty. We've been blessed with free childcare for two years. She now watches another child, who she does get paid for, and I think that's part of why I feel guilty. 

My husband feels like even if we offered her money, she wouldn't accept it. And, she would definitely appreciate a gift more than cash. We're brainstorming gift ideas too but I love casting a wide net for things like this because yall have some really unique and creative ideas !"

mamakbear11616	2021-04-22 16:28:12+00:00	Whine/grunting loop	"Wise parents, I need some help! 4 year old is having a particularly difficult two weeks at home and school and we're really not sure what to do. 

When he is afraid he is in trouble, or is being told to do something he doesn't want to do, he gets into these fits where sometimes he'll cry and sometimes he'll just whine, but he makes this specific whine/grunt sound over and over and over and he can't (or won't) shake himself out of it. At home, we try to be silly or do anything we can to break him out of the rut, but at school, with 12 other friends in the class, the teacher has him sit out in a cozy corner or sends him to hang out at the front because he won't cut it out.

Today I called school because I saw he wasn't in his classroom and the teacher said he just ""keeps making that sound."" I was able to talk to him on the phone which snapped him out of it and he went back to join his class no problem. 

Things to note, the last time I posted here, he was getting angry, yelling, and not sleeping in his bed, so we had him drop his nap at school and that was working really well until recently. Now he's not yelling anymore, but he's getting in these grumpy loops with the whining. The only thing that has changed recently is that he learned he's going to be a big brother. We did not intend to tell him so early, as it's only first trimester, but he's seen me get sick quite a few times and we wanted to assure him it wasn't coronavirus and he wasn't going to get sick and die (and ughh, how much I hate what the pandemic has done to our kids :()

Anyway, long story short, is this abnormal preschool behavior or just another fun quirk of having a f\*\*\*ing four year old? I haven't encountered it before and the few friends I asked just said that their kids are equally stubborn but in other ways. We're making sure he gets the rest he needs, no change in daily habits, and outside of these events (which happen two or three times a day), he's perfectly happy and fun. TIA!"
TK-11530	2021-04-22 16:07:11+00:00	Teaching Daughter Not To Blab	"I've been divorced and separated for over a year and a half at this point. My ex (F38) and I had a little girl (6) but separated after my now ex-wife simply gave up on the relationship. She didn't want to work on the marriage, go to counseling, or talk about her problems in the relationship; it just ended and she blamed me but never said why. After realizing that she wasn't going to work on the relationship I was quick to put the marriage behind me, I moved forward with the divorce, parenting plan, hell I even had to help her find an apartment!

I was blessed to meet someone who I gelled with rather quickly after this whole process. In fact she's been my ride or die through COVID and a lot of the legal and interpersonal battles that follow a divorce. Ex has been high conflict and passive aggressive since the beginning. One of the more insidious things she does is using the child as a conduit for information.

My partner and I were suspicious of how my ex gets information after Ex shared the fact that Partner's mom had failed a COVID test. We had only told my daughter, and since there was no close contact it simply wasn't an issue -- till Ex made it an issue by informing my daughter's preschool. She told the school, the school filed paperwork banning my daughter from preschool for two weeks immediately. By the time I heard about it and called they said it was too late we'd have to wait for the quarantine to end. I don't blame the school for following their policies strictly, I do blame Ex for not only extracting information from my child but also weaponizing it.

Last month I moved in with Partner. There was a brief interaction where Ex, from the door way, says ""this is a very nice house, how'd you find it?"". I gave a generic answer, telling her ""you know realtors, friends, family. The usual sources."" This answer must not have been satisfactory, because I caught Ex directly asking my child how I bought a new house and where I found it. She was asking on the way out and the Ring doorbell overheard the conversation.

This has lead to my partner being very mistrustful of information she shares with and around my child. For example, we're planning a trip later in this summer as we're both vaccinated. Neither of us want to keep it a secret, but my partner doesn't want my child to know because she doesn't want Ex to know we're going to be away from home for a prolonged period. This has lead to some resentment, with my partner stating ""it's like I'm living with a little spy."" I worry she blames my daughter for being used by her mom.

How do I teach my six year old not to share information about what happens at my house unless it's important information to share? I don't want her to not be able to talk about things like abuse or dangerous environments at either parent's house, or that it's okay to keep secrets, but I my partner has an expectations that Ex won't know every detail that goes on in the house."
LBluth21	2021-04-22 15:43:23+00:00	5 year old with almost daily tantrums in Kindergarten	"One of my twin girls is till struggling with big emotions. At home we can deal with it pretty well (more individual attention, letting her blow off steam with her toys in her room, talking it out) but it's becoming a problem that it's still happening at school. She's in a private kindergarten class with 15 other kids and in a bad week she has 1-2 tantrums a day that involve hiding under a table or laying on the ground crying. It usually involves another kid violating some internal rule she's decided about whatever they're playing. It's never the same kid and even when I hear her side of it I can tell it's not ever malicious on the other kids part so it's not a bullying issue or anything.

Her teacher is great about trying to engage with her and help, but she also doesn't have time to sit with her on the ground and calm her down, especially when she retreats and refuses to talk. Mainly, she just feels things *very* strongly and when she's overwhelmed with anger and frustration she just can't control her body or the tears.

I think factors that are making it worse involve: 

* being in the same class as her sister (they get along very well but they can also push each other's buttons).
* the class is made up of a lot of kids that have gone to preschool together and they've all kind of adopted roles and while she has lots of friends, there's also lots of internal cliques and I think sometimes her role has become the ""dramatic one"" and other kids expect it from her which becomes a cycle.
* She wants more learning time and less play time and free choice time where the kids make the rules. She absolutely loves the structured learning times but it's a play-based educational curriculum and school and they give lots of opportunities for self directed play.

All of these factors should improve at public school next year. She will be in a class separate from her sister, the class size is bigger but with more structure and learning time sitting in desks, and after school care will be shift in the kids and involve a new environment. But until then I'm really at a loss. She's never violent or destructive so I don't have concerns about her getting kicked out or being too problematic for mainstream learning, but she alienates her friends with the tantrums and it's hard on her and on everyone around her.

Any strategies are greatly appreciated!"
ittyBritty13	2021-04-22 15:42:54+00:00	3 year old struggling with gymnastics class	"I have enrolled my 3 year old into a gymnastics class. He has now been to three of the classes and each one has been a wildly different experience.  
  
First class was an obvious struggle with the new environment, new people, etc. I had to stay close but he slowly worked up the courage to play and participate.  
Second class he took some warming up. Took 10 mins to talk him into joining his friends and I had to stay close by again. The last 15 mins of class I was actually able to leave the room and go sit and watch from the outside.  
Class three was a giant step backwards with almost zero participation. No interest in doing much of anything. We even left 15 mins early.  
  
Is 3 years old too young for a structured type course like this? It is a one hour class once a week.  
  
He is always so excited for class. Comes right home to get on his little outfit, rushes me out the door, eagerly waits at the classroom door asking every few mins if it's time for class. But then when the door opens, he just freezes. Tells me he's shy, tells me he doesn't want to go in, tells me he wants to go home. The teachers are maybe 18 years old so they only do so much and that's ok but I'm just at a loss of what to do.  
  
If I stay, I'm the only one actively trying to get him to participate, if I leave and he asks for me they send him right out to look for me. He is also a cry until he pukes kind of kid and I would really like to avoid that so leaving the teachers to deal with any potential meltdown is not something I am comfortable doing. I knew this was going to be an adjustment for him but I'm not sure how much I should push this and stick with it or what other options I have to try and make the excitement in the class match the excitement leading up to it. Any advice would be great because I am at an absolute loss"
CapybaraAdrift	2021-04-22 15:42:08+00:00	"I don't want to be that parent, but I think my teen is playing up for attention."	"So first things first.  I am queer, and divorced from my kid's dad (hetero marriage).  My kid came out as bi when they were 11yo, and has evolved their identity to know use a more masculine name than the one I gave them at birth, and to now prefer they/them or more recently he/him pronouns.  The identify as genderqueer, and still dress largely femme.

Now.  I have no issues with their gender-related exploration and identity.  I use their preferred name and pronouns 90% of the time. (I still slip on occasion, it's a relatively recent development.)

They have a very tightknit group of friends, most of them are kids they've been friends with for years.  I think all of them are AFAB, but slowly each has been adopting a new name and new pronouns, and it's hard not to think that there's some peer-pressure/clout type thing going on.  13-14 is a weird age for any kid, wanting to both fit in and also to be special.  I don't want to be someone who dismisses self expression and discovery as trying to fit in, and I have no plans to stop them.  I just let them know I support them no matter how their identity changes and develops.

But then on TOP of this....

They have been seeing a therapist for around a year.  They had some depression and anxiety, and since it runs in my family (I myself have also sought therapy and am currently on escitalopram, have been since my child was born) I had no issues with making sure they had someone to talk to, especially when there was a brief period of time where they said they were considering self harm.

Currently things are getting worse.  They are failing almost all of their classes, have zero focus or concentration, and when confronted they breakdown about how stressful their life is, how anxious they are and things like that.  Last Saturday we had a brief family outing to pick up food and they didn't want to get out of the car (too busy on their phone) and told me their anxiety was bad and they couldn't leave the car.  There was a brief battle of wills, which they won.  And shot eye-daggers at me for half an hour after.

Also at a family gathering with a little extended family (all within our covid bubble) they started exhibiting verbal/physical tics.  When I asked them about it (in private) they told me that ""it just happens sometimes, it's not tourettes, it's no big deal"" and then I've never seen it happen again.

I feel like it's fairly obvious that yes, they have some depression and some anxiety, but that they are playing it up for attention and drama.  But how do I deal with this without becoming the big bad parent who doesn't get it?  If we try we get shrieks of ""you don't care about my mental health, I feel like you don't love me"" and I just am at a loss.  Is it time for a different therapist, maybe a family therapist?  Do we just cut off all of their internet and phone?  That seems harsh given that this is the primary way they get any socialization these days. But I know that the devices are a large part of what is hurting their school work and next year they start high school (if they are not held back this year).  

My ex and I are on good terms but we're both at our wits end on how to handle this kid.  I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or just to vent.  If you got this far, thanks for reading."
supportle55	2021-04-22 15:39:09+00:00	How do I say no? Or should I say yes?	"My son is six and has been hanging out with his friend once a week at our house and once a week at his house since school started. His friends parents want to know if my son can go with their son to their parents house next week for the day. I have barely met the grandparents and they live about an hour and a half away. They take my son's best friend (their grandson) often. 

I guess I'm just hesitant because they are strangers to me and my son. He would be just with the grandparents and his friend. 

How do I politely say no or am I over thinking it and he should just go?"

It was hard, but we stuck to minimizing screen time as much as possible so they can play with toys and develop fine motor skills.

Perhaps is Covid-fatigue, but as a dad, I want to go back to a somewhat normal life, where I enjoy watching sports and some tv shows on a relaxing weekend. Granted, I still don't want to expose the kids to violent or mature content, I wanted to ask you guys how much non-children tv content do you watch when kids are around? FYI, my kids are 3 and 1.

The first pregnancy was very good, mild morning sickness and craving alot of salty foods. We then had a very healthy boy in April 2020.

However this time around it's totally different. She's had severe morning sickness and which caused her to pass out at work and ended up to a trip to A&amp;E which then she got diagnosed with Hyperemesis gravidarum.
This was today during the morning, prescribed some anti sickness tablets to try help with the trouble.

I am posting to see how other mothers who have had this (HG) have dealt with it, what symptoms and issues they've had so we can try and get past this stage. My wife is currently in her 9th week of this 2nd pregnancy.

The other night my 8 (almost 9) year old daughter told my wife that she thinks she is fat. She said she looks bigger then all the other girls in her class and that some of her clothes fit too tight.

My wife had a talk with her about body image and health and comparing to other kids, etc, but what I’m seeking from you all is some ways in which I (her dad) could help support her without giving her a complex about her weight. 

I grew up with just me and my brother and we never talked about body image or anything like that and neither did my parents. My wife is great at the one on one conversations with her and supporting her, I just don’t want to say the wrong things or give her the wrong idea about herself.

Idk I feel like I’m charting new waters here and I don’t want my wife to feel like she has to handle this on her own.

Has anyone gone through something like this with their little ones? What helped? What should be avoided? 

Any guidance is thoroughly appreciated."

We moved to a new neighborhood a few months ago and on our street and the street behind us has tons of kids(Im talking like 30 kids between the ages of 3-10). Anyways my daughter is 6 and has made friends with them all. Usually she gets home and we do homework and eat dinner(we eat dinner early at 4pm usually done by 4:30pm). Afterwards she goes out and plays with all the kids(they stay outside and play in the yards). I make her come in around 5:15-5:45pm so she can get a shower and we can spend some time together before bed(usually playing a board game or doing a puzzle) or she goes to gymnastics(this is 2 nights a week 5:30pm-7pm). I put her to bed around 7:30pm. Anyways she is starting to her upset because all her friends are out until 7/8pm playing and I make her come in. Should I let her stay up later? She usually will fall asleep at 8/8:30pm and will read in her room until tired. She gets up at 7am just fine most mornings. Also I do enjoy our time together at night but I know at some point she will want friend time over hanging with mom. Also on weekends I do let her stay out until a bit later if she wants but typically she will go out around 11am and come home around 4pm and want to stay in because she’s tired so it’s not a issue as much.

Now she has raggedy looking hair and very very short bangs that she wants to wear sticking straight up. 

She got in trouble for sneaking scissors but, like, what else do I say. She looks wild but she seems quite pleased with her hair being out of her face and wants to keep this hair do.

I offered to get it cut short but she wants the mix of long and short. It looks like I neglect my child it's so bad. 

What the fuck do I do here? A part of me is like...screw it, it's her hair and shes a person with the autonomy to choose how she looks...but theres the other part of me that is dying inside because her long pretty hair is gone and (I hate to admit it) I'm afraid what people will think of me as a parent letting my kid have hair like this.

Algernon96	2021-04-22 12:48:16+00:00	Husband can’t handle when kiddo (7) is happy	"My husband (39) has a hard time when my son (7) gets hyper. And my son gets hyper when he’s in a good mood. So how it goes down is that my son wakes up in a great mood, talks his head off happily to me, tells me all about the new movie he’s made up or whatever, and then he so much as hops near his dad, and he gets barked at. “Can’t you just calm down?!” “You’re going a mile a minute!” 

Already my husband has basically agreed to be sidelined from the hard parenting because he loses his temper, gets vindictive and then he and the kiddo just escalate each other. Since I suggested husband stop taking part in discipline, the kiddo’s difficult behavior has completely taken a 180. He’d have angry tantrums before and his teacher complained about him. Since the husband stepped back, I kid you not, every behavioral issue we had melted away. The teacher is praising his turnaround. Husband even acknowledges, yes, he’s been so much better since I haven’t been making things worse. 

So I’m getting frustrated. I don’t have a partner for the tough moments and when the kid is happy, he complains he’s too hyper. So I’m feeling like I don’t have a partner at all. For about an hour at night, they play video games together. That’s pretty much their only healthy interaction. 

Is this normal? Aren’t 7yo kids hyper on the whole? If he’s well behaved, why should I tell him to calm down (as my husband keeps insisting I do)? Do other people get angry when their kid is happy/excited?"
kid_with_the_nose	2021-04-22 12:43:45+00:00	My son got slapped over a rude joke - thoughts?	"My son is 12 years old. He’s a sweet, adorable, goofy kid who charms the pants off anyone he meets. He's well-liked amongst his friends and he's always been a ""class-clown"" type. He does get into trouble sometimes, but he usually apologizes really quickly and takes his punishments on the chin.

The other day, he came home with a bright pink mark on his cheek. I got pretty concerned and asked him what had happened, but he just said he'd crashed into a doorway. He was acting a little fidgety and I pressed him further, but he didn't change his story. I gave him some ice to put on the wound and he seemed to be doing better later.
However, later I was talking to his older brother and apparently he saw what really happened.
So my son and his friends were hanging out at a nearby park, as they often do. Apparently, my son made a rude, sarcastic joke towards one of the other boys, regarding his father who left the family and is no longer in the picture. The boy promptly came up and slapped my son across the face. It must have been very, very, hard; as it left a bright red mark on my son’s cheeks and bruising which has lasted for a few days.

My older son also said, to be fair, that my younger son got teary-eyed and apologized profusely as soon as the other kid hit him. I think I should clarify that they've been friends in the past, and my older son said the kid ultimately accepted my son's apology, and that the two of them ended up laughing over it.

 My son’s a witty, sarcastic kid, always having some smart quip to chime in. I believe that he thought he was just messing around, but probably went too far.

My son told us the truth, though he seemed really embarrassed and ashamed by it. My husband told him that it’s no worse than he deserved for making a comment like that.

I believe my son needs to be respectful, but that violence isn’t the answer. The boy in question is a lot bigger and stronger than my son, who’s always been rather scrawny and sensitive.

Is there anything I should be doing about this?"

My 3 year old will not sleep at night all of a sudden. He will wake up, ask me to tuck him in, and lay there for five minutes before waking up again and asking for the same thing. This lasts hours, from around 2-6 am. 

I've always read that they best way to handle it is to push through it and put your child back to bed with minimal interaction. No getting upset, no making it a fun game for them. Just get up, put your kid to bed, and go back to what you were doing. 

However, my 2 year old is now also up at night (teething) and I've had to get more help from my husband to put 3yo down. He (I am as well) is very frustrated with constantly getting up with my 3 year old and wants to try letting him be upset at night. He says we've developed bad habits. 

I'm at a loss, I'm very tired and I know my husband is as well (he works from basically 6am to 6pm). I'm feeling guilty, both for getting him up and for possibly setting up my oldest to be miserable for the next few days while we try to re-sleep train him.

After doing some research I believe she has some slight torticollis. She definitely favors one side and will turn her head back to the flat side when you try to adjust her. I tried turning her in her bassinet and she continues to favor that one side.  The past two nights every time I woke up I would turn her head. She pretty much always turns it back after some time.  I’m trying to keep her off her head during the day but I’ve got twins so it’s not really possible to avoid swings and what not.  I am trying to position her in those things with a rolled up burp cloth under her neck so she can’t turn to the flat side. I’m working on stretching her to help correct torticollis. 

I’m wondering if anyone had a baby with plagiocephaly and DIDNT seek treatment or a helmet. The helmet just seems like torture and I’m terrified well have to make that decision fast. Is it really necessary? Since she’s a female won’t her hair conceal any flattening in the future?"
ninjaninja9	2021-04-22 12:28:43+00:00	My 23 year old gets beaten up by my 12 year old.	"My 23 year old gets beaten up by my 12 year old. My daughter ( has been away 7 years now) had come back for vacation and due to covid she is living with us now. My 12 year old, has been very moody lately, she is generally a very loving caring child. Based on her moods, she either extremely rude or nice to the 23yr old. She hits her older sibling. I have no idea how to advice both of them. How to stop the younger one from hitting and being bossy towards the older one. And what to tell the 23 year old, she doesn't hit back or say nothing to the younger except words like "" stop hitting me , please stop""
Im extremely worried about both of them. The older one is too fragile. I would be extremely grateful if any one you can help me out on this"
Financial_Advisor500	2021-04-22 12:21:17+00:00	Dealing with kids’ (5 and 7) behavior as coparents?	"This is pretty frequent but it happened tonight.

It was around 8:00PM and the five-year-old had had a busy day with school and was very cranky.

She has a habit of not wiping because she “doesn’t know how.” She went to the bathroom and came back and was obviously still wet. My ex-wife sternly told her to wipe and she didn’t want to. Eventually she got disrespectful and rude and lost her TV period. My ex-wife sent her to her room.

From there she was still disrespectful and mad and would poke herself out from time to time only to be ordered back in. She would not get a snack like her sister until she finished.

All this happened on FaceTime, so I asked my ex-wife to let me talk to her. My older daughter was given the phone and asked to give it to her sister.

She took it to her. When I started talking, I was trying to comfort her. I told her that she can feel frustrated but she should think about that when it happens so she doesn’t be mean to her mommy. We talked about why she’s frustrated (having to wipe, no TV or snack). I told her she was frustrated but was being nice to me, and if that she explained her emotions to her mommy she could help her. 

After some convincing she decided to talk to her mommy with my help. She took me to her mom with her. I said, “I feel...” and she said “frustrated.” I said, “I also feel...” and she said “frustrated?” Lol. It was cute. I was trying to get her to say sorry and when I told her that, she said sorry. Her mom asked what she was sorry for and she said “nothing.” Sigh. I reminded her that we had talked about her being mean and then she answered that. My ex-wife was calm and glad and discussed how she felt as well. They went and got the snack and my daughter was back in control of herself.

Did I step on my ex-wife’s toes? I stepped in because I hate seeing my daughters make decisions that get them into progressively worse trouble when their emotions take over. Could I have helped in a different way? Or just let go and worry about things on only my weekends?"

QuitUsual4736	2021-04-22 11:26:53+00:00	Should I make my 9 year old daughter continue her piano lessons?	She is pretty good for her age and loves her piano teacher. The problem is she doesn’t practice (I have a reminder set up for 15 mins twice a week that is ignored every time) and hates to play for other people. So to me - I half feel like- what’s the point? The lessons are $180 a month. Her dad and I feel like she is privileged as neither of us ever had any music lessons growing up. Should I continue to push her or should I cancel the lessons? Is it better for us to just save the money or find some other hobby for her. She has been playing since she was 4 so I feel like a huge disappointment because we’ve invested so much time and money so far and she can read music now which I’m so proud of her. I keep trying to explain what a cool life skill it is to be able to read and play music but she just looks at it is as time away from Roblox. I don’t want to be all tiger mom about it... but I hate to throw away what she’s learned so far. Should I push her through the teenage years or read the signs and move on?

I’ve mad so many mistakes in my life, I’m 23 now and I’ve made choices that still haunt me, things I am unhappy about which messed me up. I’ve been in relationships which didn’t end well. I am not proud of what I did.
Fast forward to 2020, my sibling (17F) started talking to a boy if not boys, she won’t let me get close to her phone, she hides things from everyone else and I see myself in her, she reminds me of when I was her age I used to do the same thing, I would hide my phone because I was texting a girl...things didn’t end well with me, I do not want her to be like me and end up regretting her life choices, I learned not to mess with other peoples feelings and get attached( not that I did) I got cheated on and it hurts so much. I do not want her to fall in the same hole as me. Please advice me on this. I checked her phone without her consent today and found messages from 2 guys, I can’t deal with it but feel guilty as if it’s my fault, as if I started it and now she’s following. I do not know what to do."
kznas	2021-04-22 10:58:02+00:00	Do we owe our parents because they gave birth to us?	"I m from South East Asian Buddhist background. My parents and I both migrated to Australia 9 years ago.
 In my culture we are brought up to think parents should be respected as much as Gods. 
We are always told that kids should always listen to their parents, we should always respect them and always put them before.

In both culture &amp; religious teachings, children owe their parents so much for giving them birth and bringing them up to adulthood. 

This is a debt children can never repay. And we are always taught to take care of our parents. This leaves a huge financial burden on a lot of burmese children as it is an expectation for adults to financially support their parents. 

Now I am struggling so much as I see things differently as I grew up in western culture. 
I moved out of home, finished my degree, work and bought a house like normal adult person. I never used drugs, stayed out of trouble and I am trying my best to have a decent life. 

But this isn't enough. My dad especially thinks I have gone astray. He would tell me his friends have good children and we have gown up in  away he disapprove of. His disappointment is so hurtful because all the bad things I have done is some minor trouble I have caused as a teenager (I used to not pick up their calls sometimes when I am outside because they cause me so much anxiety), going out to meet with friends, a date or traveling (but they see it as being irresponsible), and having a white boyfriend (my dad want us to marry a burmese guy).

And my mums favorite line of argument is ""I almost died giving birth to u and it's not worth it).

I am so tired of this culture of parents thinking they own their kids because they gave birth.


But again, in western culture children expects to get a lot from their parents. That parents are simply responsible to give children the best life possible because it's their job.

It feels so strange to me, almost selfish and ungrateful to my ears.
But at the same time my own culture is making me drown in stress, anxiety and a feeling of burden.

Which culture do u think is the most fair?"
investinlady	2021-04-22 09:41:58+00:00	Leaving child for University...	"I haven't seen anyone post about this and I am curious if I am wrong. I am about to be 23, I have a 2 year old daughter and I'm attending a community college. However, I have been wanting to attend UCLA ever since I was in high school but I always thought it'd be impossible. But I am now pursuing it because you only live once. I have my daughter, though. I live about two hours away from UCLA. Would I be a horrible parent to leave my child with my mother and family? My BD would be able to help her as he is still in our daughters life. But, what if he places child support on me? I currently am in the early stage of placing child support on him after two years. The judge has to sign off on the given amount and I've yet to receive a payment. But, I am wondering if I am being selfish for wanting to leave my daughter here, two hours away. I simply can not see how being a UCLA student, working to pay rent of 1,000+ and a babysitter, groceries, etc, in LA. But I see myself doing fine with a roommate and Doordash and school. I love my daughter to death, but if I go through with this, it would benefit us a lot, but I would miss out on so much. I do have the choice of going to this other university around me and I have the green light from my mom to leave my daughter with her and visit on the weekends since the university is about 1h 30m away. Not much of a difference... Who knows if I will leave her but is this wrong, selfish and just plain stupid?"
spikeboy4	2021-04-22 08:02:14+00:00	"My parents are saying my house isn't ""fit for bringing a baby into"""	"This one may turn into a long one, so apologies in advance.

For background, my wife is due in about 4 weeks. Back in November we started some party major work on the house, knocking through walls, that kind of thing.

In December we ordered some steel beams and new windows and doors. Between covid, brexit etc the didn't arrive until the start of April. So not last minute due to bad planning, just circumstances. 

We need to finish the work so we have space for a nursery. I've had builders in, taken time off work to work on it and basically been busting my ass to try and get all the work done in time. Everything that was downstairs is now in boxes upstairs so it is out of the way, which makes the upstairs pretty cluttered.

My mother, from a genuine place of concern I'm sure, keeps talking about how the dust will be bad for the baby if she arrives early, I should be wiping down all the surfaces and moping every day, I should be paying cleaners to come in a couple of times a week etc.

My wife is 8 months pregnant, works full time and has back and pelvic pain, so I can't exactly ask her to do it every day. I'm now back at work and all my spare time is spent on the house. And if anybody has ever taken a stihl saw to brick wall they will know that brick dust takes days to settle.

I know its a trade off between spending time cleaning and getting the house done sooner, and I can only do my best but as if I wasn't already stressed about getting the house work finished, feeling guilty about pissing off the neighbours with the noise, neglecting my wife and dog by spending all my time either doing building work or working at my job, now I'm getting warnings that my house is dirty and dusty, I'm going to give my baby respiratory problems etc etc.

A similar thing happened to a friend and his parents basically tried to keep the baby and report to social services that the house wasn't fit for a baby.

I don't really know what to do, to be honest. There isn't dust covering every surface or anything, the common areas are clean but areas I can't get to easily still have brick dust. Are they right and I should prioritise cleaning over finishing the work? Should I just tell them to mind their own goddam business and not give me more things to worry about?"
thelifeofawolf	2021-04-22 07:03:43+00:00	My infant son shrieks louder than I have ever heard..... SOS	"My son is just over 5 months and has developed a new love for shrieking at the top of his longs for various reasons. Sometimes it’s because he likes the sound of his own voice, his toy is out of reach, I’m not holding him, I *am* holding him, he’s in the middle of tummy time, he’s laying on his back, etc.... literally anything and everything. He could be beyond happy and screech because of how happy he is. 

However, I’m prone to headaches and migraines and today my son has shrieked so loud and so often that I had a headache so intense that Motrin wouldn’t help and I felt like I was going to pass out. 

Please tell me it gets better or that this is just a phase. There has to be a light at the end of this *very* loud tunnel."

My boys don't really talk yet; they understand us perfectly and say words (more and more, so I'm not worried or anything), but they can't form sentences yet. So more often than not, whenever they want something it's either ""ehh"" or whining. 
I just can't with the whining anymore. It's everyday and what feels like all. day. long. That coupled with them ""fighting"" over their stuff which results in crying.. I have to stop myself from screaming. 
Can someone please tell me this passes and it's just a phase? And can someone also tell me that it's not unusual for 2,5 yo (twin) boys to be so late with their vocabulary?"

Forward_Material_378	2021-04-22 03:46:21+00:00	How to explain to my kid why she won’t be invited	"Note: I’m in Australia where covid isn’t an issue, so having get togethers isn’t a problem here. 

My daughter is nearly six and is in her first year of school. She is the most outgoing, loveable, social butterfly I’ve ever met. Everyone who meets her tells me what a wonderful little girl she is. 

Me, on the other hand, am not in any way shape or form. I’m autistic with adhd and I am socially....stupid. I only have a couple of friends and since as long as I can remember I’ve always been pushed out of groups and excluded from everything. Not looking for sympathy, I’m just painting the picture. 

When school started in January I tried so hard with the other mums. I cut out the negativity, made sure I wasn’t talking too much, tried extra hard to read social cues. I thought I was doing ok. Before the Easter holidays I exchanged numbers with my daughters best friend’s mum (J) and we said we’d meet up over the break. I didn’t hear anything the first week so the second week I reached out but they were busy. No big deal, or so I thought. First day back after break I was standing with the group (4 other ladies) and they were talking about all the stuff they did together over the holiday. Every time I started to say anything (not about them leaving us out) J would listen for a few seconds then turn to someone else and talk to them. 

I was back in high school, I started to panic and thankfully the bell rang and we all left. I was upset and I’m now worried about my kids. Gone are the days of dropping your kids off for birthday parties and sleepovers. Now the parents have to stay and be social. And I know that when the parent is a social outcast that the kids don’t get invited places (Easter break being the first of many examples I’m sure we will encounter)

So how do I explain to my wonderful, bubbly social butterfly (and her brothers in coming years) that the reason she is always left out isn’t because of her but because her mother just isn’t likeable? I could care less if they don’t like me but my heart just hurts for my little girl 😥"
Cayley928	2021-04-22 03:15:15+00:00	Never go through your childs personal belongings!!!	"I keep seeing parents talking about how they pay for their childrens phone which gives them every right to go through it. I don't know why I'm so upset over this, but don't be those people!!! I know most parents are just worried about their children but if parents took the time to create trust with their children they wouldn't have to snoop so hard. If you don't know what you're children are doing or getting into it's your own fault so don't punish them by violating their privacy. If you had created a trusting and caring environment for them they wouldn't feel the need to hide everything from you."

I am single, no boyfriend no husband. And let me just say, shit’s FUCKING hard!!!! 
I’ve honestly been stuck in this depression, I feel lonely, I want friends. I want a break. My daughter is with me all the time and I don’t have any family members willing to watch her while I take a night for myself or something. I am a young mom so I watch as all my peers (I’m 22) go out, find love, start loving, stable families of their own where both parents are available. I can’t help but envy those people. My child was not expected in the slightest, and my child’s dad was the one to convince me that I CAN parent, even when I knew I couldn’t. I’m a good mom but I just know I wasn’t meant to have a child so early on, as I grew up pretty innocent and over-protected and had a lot more living and financial work left to do before having kids. It feels bad to be saying this but I’m just so so depressed and sad knowing that this is really my life now. I really do envy those who have a nice family they can depend on for babysitting, or honestly just a nice family in general. I grew up in a broken family and am now trying to navigate parenthood in a way that breaks the “generational curse”. It’s super hard and I try my best each and every day but it gets so exhausting."
Texangonenorth	2021-04-22 01:21:51+00:00	Need Advice re FMLA / STD	"Husband and I are 32 weeks along tomorrow. LO is due June 17.

Both of us are working currently but are intending of course to take time off for baby’s arrival.

He gets four weeks paid of parental leave to take that can be used however he likes as long as it’s taken before baby’s 1st birthday.

I can use Short term disability, FMLA (though I am not eligible until my employer anniversary of July 13), and PTO if I wish (granted I have just over a week saved up).
12 weeks from July 13 is the first week of October. So assuming baby comes around actual due date that could be 16 weeks of time off and STD only covers 5 weeks and obviously it’s not full coverage.

Additional factors to know: we live in an apartment and our lease needs to be renewed and as expected rent is going up.
The cheapest option is signing for a 15 month lease that would be $66 dollars more than our current amount.
Another option is buying a house (in a market that favors the seller and in month 8/9 of a pregnancy).
Our insurance is through my husbands employer so his check brings in less than mine does. Adding a child to the plan will only worsen this of course.
We would be putting our child into daycare once I return to work.

I am curious to hear how others managed going down an income for a few months when you’re bringing a baby into the world."

He has specifically asked about Ramadan, and wants to fast because his school friend is currently fasting and told him ""God will reward him"". It seems he driven by the idea that God will give him material things that he wishes for. I've explained the best I could that God doesn't reward you with material things, and that there is a lot he needs to learn before just committing to Ramadan and fasting. That we also need to educate ourselves if we want to help him learn. We told him as he gets older he can explore the many religions of the world, but at this time we can't just start fasting without understanding why it's done."

My mother in law will watch my daughter 4 days a week and my mom offered to take her one day a week, which happened to be today. The minute I got to my moms to pick the baby up, she started complaining about how fussy she was, how she eats too much (she literally had 3 bottles in the 8 hours she was there that’s completely normal), how she doesn’t nap long enough, and basically how exhausting it was to watch her. My mom looked beyond miserable and I honestly got a bad vibe. Just to put it in perspective, my daughter is a super happy baby and generally only cries when she’s hungry. My mother in law had her two days this week and both days commented on how awesome she was and how much she enjoyed having her. I do not feel comfortable leaving my daughter with my mom again and at this point I’m not willing to do so. I have to find a kind but firm way to let her know.I keep second guessing myself but I don’t think I’m being too harsh. My mom is not a patient woman, she walked out on me when I was 6 and I didn’t see her again until I was 17.  She’s just not motherly. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but clearly she isn’t cut out to care for kids.

Kmariam	2021-04-22 00:57:07+00:00	6 year old daughter has had intense anxiety. Looking for advice.	"I will preface this by saying I have bad anxiety, particularly about health related issues. I have worked so hard to keep those thoughts and obsessions at bay and haven’t had any major worries for the last two years with therapy and meds. 

On Saturday night my 6 year old randomly threw up. She complained of a stomach ache, said my food smelled bad (has always hated seafood smells), then threw up a very large amount. She felt fine after throwing up but wouldn’t eat anything. Was tired and slept the entire night (rare because she always comes into my bed). I knew of a few other kids who had the stomach bug at the school and chalked it up to a quick thing. 

Sunday she woke up feeling better but Sunday night around dinner time had a major anxiety episode thinking about how she threw up. She was shaking and refusing to eat dinner. I comforted her as best as I could and didn’t force the eating issue. The last time she threw up she was 2 years old, so I totally understood why she was having such a  strong reaction to the puking episode-it was definitely scary for her. 

Monday was better, but yesterday and today she continues to bring it up constantly. I tried taking her to the movies today since it’s April vacation week and she wanted to leave in the middle of the movie because she said she was staring to feel nervous. She has always been an anxious child, so I’m used to strong reactions from her, but this is definitely the most intense I have seen. I’ve also noticed some OCD Type of behaviors lately too- counting, talking about germs and hand washing (although the school is really hammering them with that type of stuff due to COVID), and she has developed a type of vocal tic where she’s constantly throat clearing while stressed. When I ask her about it she says it makes her feel better when she is nervous. Today she was leaning in a weird position for a while doing blocks and said her neck hurt and she was terrified her neck was broken (we do have a friend who recently broke an arm and she has been very fixated on it). She says she keeps thinking about throwing up and being sick. 

I’ve tried everything I can think of- we read a book about worries, I told her we could make a “worry monster”, etc. i left a message for her pedi tonight to see what they recommend, but this is really throwing me for a loop and triggering my anxiety trying to figure out what is going on, and I feel responsible for all of this since I struggle with the exact same type of fears, although I do my best to keep mine at bay and away from my kids."

milfinthemaking	2021-04-22 00:48:29+00:00	My toddler made his first gesture today	"My son is 15 months old and hasn't met hardly any verbal or social milestones yet.  No words, no meaningful gestures, doesn't interact with us much, doesn't know his name or respond to our voices... you get the point. I've been told by family members not to worry, that he's just going at his own pace but I still asked the Pediatrician for a referral to Early Intervention specialists just for an assessment in case there is something more I can do for him. I worry that he is frustrated with his lack of expressive communication at times and has to rely on crying to tell us anything. 

But today, we were outside doing our usual walk around the apartment complex grounds, he approached a tall curb and put both of his arms out as a way of asking for help getting down!! 
I was amazed and tested it out 2 more times while we were outside. He did it each time! Most people might not relate to this and no one in my life will think its a big deal but I'm so happy to finally have gotten a form of communication that isn't biting, crying, or slapping from the person I love the most in this world ❤"
therealrizzo5	2021-04-22 00:24:35+00:00	Female Toddler Being Touched? Help please.	"Hi all.
I have a two and a half year old (will be three in August) and she has April vacation this week and my grandparents are helping out. I trust my parents and my in-laws FULLY but my mom has a boyfriend both in their early 60's (they've been dating for over 6 years) and he's quiet but always a nice guy and I don't necessarily have a reason not to trust him.

Today when we were getting ready for bed my daughter said her bum (vagina) hurts. Not totally out of the ordinary because everytime she says her bum hurts (wiping too hard from trying to get poop off) we give her some lotion to put on it. She's been on a big lotion kick but she was just starting to buck the trend but tonight she took off her PJs and said her bum hurt BUT she said it hurt inside.

It's hard to ask her questions without her just saying yes. If you try to ask her direct questions she'll usually just agree.
But she said it hurt inside and it was from grampy and grammy. Assuming she had a poop and they were aggressive wiping. The fact that she also said ""grammy"" wouldn't make sense because I know my mom wouldn't do anything like that but when I asked if it was ""grampy"" she would say ""grampy and grammy"".

Her vagina doesn't appear red or any different than usual. She wasnt acting any different than normal tonight but I just don't know what to do.
I asked my mom and she said nothing happened (which I believe she wouldn't go along with anything like that if she knew about it) and said she had a poop but I just really really don't know how to approach this. Based on the room setup it's impossible to setup a camera at the changing table without being obvious - and it would be hard to get a clear shot anyways.

Thanks for any help."
ermonda	2021-04-22 00:21:29+00:00	4 year olds and empathy	"I am concerned about my 4 year old daughter’s lack of empathy. I have had 2 miscarriages in the past 6 months. Both times it happened she was with me and it was hard to hide my emotions. I spent both days crying. Not loud or dramatic crying but tears streaming down my face most of the day. I don’t typically ever cry so it’s not like it’s normal for her to see me like that. 

On both occasions I was clearly very upset and not myself and my daughter didn’t acknowledge or seem to care. Instead she would look me right in the eyes and ask me to play a game, turn on TV, get something to eat, etc. I found it really odd that she didn’t ask if I was ok or question why I was crying/upset. This last time I even asked her if she noticed that I was crying and she just kind of shrugged her shoulders. I told her that I was having a really hard time, not feeling well etc but she didn’t seem to care. 

I’m not necessarily looking for sympathy from her but it worries me that she doesn’t seem to recognize or care when someone close to her is in pain and at least offer a hug. I think I model empathy often and we read books about feelings and helping others but she often makes it about herself. 

Am I right to think that she should be more empathetic or are most 4 year olds like this? What can I do to get her to be more concerned about others feelings?"
sweetassunshine	2021-04-22 00:18:43+00:00	Just a usual morning....	"Family life can be crazy, and the balance between work and home life is an ever constant battle of competing priorities. My husband starts work at 5am, so the morning routine is down to myself each morning. I mostly do things the night before but I had worked late yesterday and just collapsed after I'd finished extra work after the kids were in bed. I wanted to share my morning as I have found this situation absolutely hilarious....

After a night of broken sleep between my two young kids (1, 4) this is was my morning...

I made lunches for all three of us, both kids breakfast, made slow cooker dinner so kids can eat as soon as we get home tonight (my day to pick them up), unpacked dishwasher, cleaned kitchen, packed bags, drink bottles, picked up downstairs, showered and dressed both kids, showered, dressed and make-up for myself ready for work, added extra stuff need for afternoon chores/drop offs/pick ups in the car, found missing shoes, on the go coffee for me in the keep cup, kids in car, dropped miss 1 at daycare, drove 45min in traffic, picked up the portacot needed for the weekend, drove 20min in traffic, dropped Mister 4 at kindy, drove 20min in traffic, made it to work on time for an 8.30 teleconference that was only organised this morning..... but I accidentally left my keycard at home to swipe open the door at my work building. I haven't forgotten it before, but its not an issue, I just need someone to open the door. My colleague is working from home in her pjs and boss decided he wanted a day off.

""You should be more organised"" from the admin girl who opened the door for me.

My eyes rolled so far back they nearly fell out of my head.... thanks for the tip...🤣🤣"
scistudies	2021-04-22 00:14:12+00:00	Ex wants me to stop our 8 yo son from calling his soon to be step dad “dad.”	"Some background; I divorced my sons father earlier this year. He asked me to fill out everything, file everything. He agreed to pretty much whatever because he didn’t want to hire a lawyer. He wouldn’t complete the required coparenting class, and after failing to enroll our son in school back in August, I took over primary custody. We live in different states, about 3 hours away. My new partner and I have made every effort to drive my son there after school on Friday, to turn around and drive the 3 hours home, just to do it all again on Sunday. Twice a month, sometimes more. My ex has never been to our state since our son moved in with me in August. I am now pregnant. My boyfriend has been a big help, and we plan to get married eventually. My ex says he accepts that my bf will be our son’s step dad.  I became very sick (I underwent treatment for cancer last year and being pregnant has been hard on my health). My son is excited to have a new sibling. He started asking if my bf would still like him, help him and play with him when the baby is born. He has a good relationship with my bf and is a very anxious little boy. 

I have our son call his dad every night. Recently after one call I received an angry text from my ex saying I needed to talk to our son because he referred to my bf as dad. He said it has happened before and he is my son’s only dad. I pointed out we have never told our son, nor encouraged in the slightest for him to call my bf dad. We have always referred to my bf by his first name, and usually our son does too. I also said he is young and after visiting there I myself get called dad or grandma for a while. He insisted I talk to our son. I had no idea what exactly he wanted me to say. Our son knows my bf is not his dad. We’ve had the talk about what a step parent is and how the baby will be his half sibling. He’s 8. And I feel telling him he can’t call this person that has basically helped raise him for the past 9 months dad will make him unnecessarily upset. My ex also has custody of our teen, and he does not ensure I even speak to her once a week. I don’t ask for child support. I am literally the only one putting in effort to ensure he even sees our son. I later found out that what had actually prompted this text was our son saying he had to ask “his parents” if he could do something. He didn’t even specifically call my bf dad. But since I had to have this awkward conversation reminding him my bf isn’t his dad,  he has started to call him dad. I’m not sure what to do here."

My partner joked about teaching him Dada first because we’re a lesbian couple. We’re not actually going to do that. Mama seems like the obvious choice but we had more unique first words so I’m leaning away from that. Mine was kitty, which is great if you look at my username. I do actually go by that irl so my first word fit me perfectly. My partner’s was moon.

baddieheifer	2021-04-22 00:10:28+00:00	Silent Treatment	"Reddit, 

How do you guys feels about parents giving their children the silent treatment?

Quick background on my parents, they were never married, but had 3 of us. They never loved each other, but chose stay together under the same roof once the had my oldest brother. As a result there are now three of us. Because there was no love between our parents, we grew up constantly witnessing their fights and insults. By the time I was 5 or 6, they had their major, scandalous fight that ended up with them giving each other the silent treatment for over 20 years (I am now 25 years old). They still live under the same roof (because of my mom’s mental health issues, she cannot live on her own), and I’m the last sibling to still live with them. 

Anyway, my parents have also picked fights with myself and my two older siblings in the past. The thing is, every time I fight with them, I too get the silent treatment from them. The worst ones have been from my dad. My mom usually gets over it within a week. The first time my dad gave me the silent treatment, I was 15 years old and it was over me giving my neighbors our wifi password (fuck me for being very neighborly). That one lasted about 2 weeks. About 4 weeks ago, I got into another of many arguments with my dad over me not wanting to help him with something related to the phone. It’s not that I don’t want to help him, it’s that he always fucking complains that I don’t show him things correctly, which honestly makes me not want to help him. Don’t insult the help you’re getting!!

Anyway, the argument ended with him saying that I don’t deserve to be respected and that if I didn’t like it, to leave his house. I was so pissed and I walked away. He has not spoken to me since. 

My thing with silent treatments is that I feel people use that to get away with not apologizing. In my 25 years of existing I have NEVER gotten a single apology from them. I on the other hand am known to be the most emotional and sensitive in the family so I always apologize when I’m in the wrong. I know they’re my parents but I just want to pull them by their ears and yell that I want an apology. Especially my stubborn dad. This has been the longest silent treatment I’ve gotten. To be honest, I don’t mind it now because I’m an adult and I’m logical, and I’m this case I know I’m not in the wrong. Also I at least have some peace. But as a child it fucked me up. I always felt like I was the bad person and I feel like that’s why I always avoid speaking up and confronting others. 

I think giving your kids the silent treatment can be emotionally draining for them and I wish parents understood that."
MrReeRee	2021-04-21 23:54:59+00:00	MEH Days.	"My  husband and I were raised in households where education trumped mental health, we were never given days off when our minds and souls needed it. And goodness, sometimes we just needed them.

 Fast forward 20 years and we are parents of 6 amazing kids (from 4-15). Very early on we introduced MEH Days. Mental and Emotional Health Days. Kids have enough pressure as it is, especially my older 4 in high school, one day to watch movies, eat junk food and cuddle with mum isn't such a big deal.

Kids mental health is so important in this day and age, and as a mental health sufferer myself, I hope I can educate my kids that taking a day to reset is more than ok."

Please help	"My 20 year brother is living on his own in an apartment, is manic depression/bipolar disorder, self destructive and is going up to 4 days at a time without eating and, won't seek help. He is mentally abusive to my father. It's taken a toll on my father as he tries to bring meals to my brother's apartment just so has something to eat. A lot of times my brother doesn't open the door for him. My brother should be on medication but isn't taking it. In my opinion, he isnt capable of living on his own and should be admitted to a subsidized group home where he will be given meals, and be under care. I don't live in the US, but he lives there and I'm seeking advice as to what my father and I could do to get him help... My brother contiplated suicide last year, and I feel like it could happen someday if he doesn't get help. He's had cops at his apartment a few times, and admitted to a hospital for 3 days last year, in which he was back to normal when given medication but flushed them down the toilet after 2 weeks. He is seriously incapable of living on his own.

Advice please on what I should do. I know he's an ADULT now, but he's mentally incapable and It breaks my heart having my father be so scared to see if he's starving himself or is destroying himself. 

Thanks so much - we just need some advice on this as calling the cops and admiring to a hospital for 3 days doesn't do anything. He just throws out his medication."
an0therFate	2021-04-21 23:27:54+00:00	Is this a fair parenting set up between my wife and I?	"
We have have a 7 month old boy.  My wife watches him all day when I’m at work, any time between 6am to 4pm.  Just this week she started working her seasonal dispatching job from home.  So she hasn’t been working since October of last year when baby was born.  When I get home I’m pretty much on dad duty the rest of the night.  So I get up at 6am to go to work and get home around 4pm.

I just feel like I am over worked all day every day.  I’m tired when I get off work (half labor half desk job typically) then I have to watch him the rest of the night anytime between 8-11pm depending on the night with no naps because I have the non nap baby.

Meanwhile my wife gets to lay in bed, watch her stocks, be on tik tok, and take a bath every night (sometimes 2 a night) while I’m in the baby’s room all night playing with him.  The only free time I get is after he goes to bed.  I can get a few things done around the house at night but not much.  Then I have to watch him on the baby monitor all night.  Sometimes he goes to bed earlier like around 8pm but will then wake up again and I will have to tend to him again.  Our current agreement is that I have to get up and feed him if he wakes up anytime before 3am if he wakes and she takes care of anything after.  He usually gets up around 3 or 4 am every night.

I am just wondering what fellow parents think of this.  Is it wrong that I feel like I’m tired and overworked and I don’t get much help at all in the evenings.

She does feed him most of his meals during the day and clean up most of the poopy diapers during the day.  Sometimes I’ll get one at night and I’ll feed him dinner and some bottles at night.  So there are some trade offs but I just feel like the scales are tipped in her favor of having time to unwind.  And I just hardly feel like there is much of that for me.

Edit: and actually I don’t really “unwind” that much.  It’s usually time I spend cleaning or fixing up my house.  Occasionally I’ll watch a movie or read."
ccharding	2021-04-21 23:19:40+00:00	My Baby Shark has a biting problem (2.5yrs)	"My 2.5 year old daughter developed a biting problem in the past few weeks. She is biting different kids at daycare and sometimes unprovoked. Daycare is saying they are working with her but has warned they need to consider the other children's health and safety (i.e. kick her out if it continues). When she bites us we put her in timeout for 2 minutes and discuss no biting, it hurts, don't hurt your friends, etc. She seems to be smart enough that after she hurts us she says sorry...but the damage has already been done.

I'd love to get anyone's experiences and advice. My wife and I are at a loss."

If you think you're gonna be offended, I suggest you to better not read further and just ignore this post.
Content warning: sex education, pornography 

I know this may sound weird and even inappropriate at first, but please hear me out before you make bad assumptions. I'm a teacher (M32) and I teach kids who are 7-12 years old. Kids are often really loud while on breaks and I overhear weird and silly stuff a lot. Usually I just laugh it off. But I could never ignore something I've heard that one time. Long story short, a 12 year old kid had no idea what sex exactly was. They said they heard of it (obviously) but never understood what it is. And that really got me questioning our entire school system. How could we let this happen? Poor kid is probably even made fun of because their parents didn't teach them about basic human biology and nature. And on top of that, they're gonna be very confused when puberty starts. I think we as adults are very responsible for explaining the topics of sex, birth, hormones and human bodies in general without making it taboo. So after some thinking I've come to the conclusion. We should expose kids to pornography. I don't mean any kind. Anything that's unrealistic and straight up gross is off the list. But if we could carefully choose and make a playlist of good porn videos that potray basic act of sex (safe and protected sex) we would help them understand it much better. Sex is a normal part of our lives. And sexual urges occur when children go through puberty. Instead of banning pornographic content and shaming them for *normal* changes they go through, we should start being more transparent with them. And I don't think verbal communication is enough. When they hear about it, they'd be curious and probably search up porn themselves. But everyone knows that also causes anxiety and guilt because they might feel like they're doing something wrong and therefore they will hide it from their parents. And when something seems forbidden, you know how that goes. It just becomes more appealing to them and they start watching porn in secret. And who knows what kind of porn.... think about it. If you don't want your kid to look at all kinds of pretty gross stuff and develop porn addiction by the time they are young adults, I think picking out more appropriate pornography specifically for them might be of very positive effect on them. Getting familiar with sex while being accepted and supported by their parents in such confusing period of their lives would help them develop healthier view on sex. And since they are also visual learners, that knowledge may come in handy later when they find a partner. I even think it's kind of embarassing to be 12 and not know about sex, but obviously I don't blame the kid. What are your thoughts on this? Does this make any sense to you? 

All I know is that when I become a parent, I'm gonna educate them and encourage them to watch porn.
Also, I'd like to note that by sex I don't only refer to heterosexual ""penis-to-vagina"" intercourse. We should educate them about all kinds of sex and explain different sexualities to them. Don't assume your kids sexuality and don't force heteronormative views on sex and relationships when there's so much more to learn. I'm curious about your opinions on this."
Meagazilla89	2021-04-21 21:53:56+00:00	What do you do when gentle parenting isn’t working (age 3)	My son is very energetic and we have tried our best to channel his energy towards positive outcome but he just really seems to like to do things he knows is naughty or unkind. Time outs and gentle parenting techniques aren’t working and I really don’t believe corporal punishment works so I don’t know where to go from here. It’s especially pressing because he’s acting up at daycare and I won’t be able to to finish my schooling if he can’t go there anymore. Also please be kind because I already feel like an absolute failure of a parent and have cried in frustration about this.
sometimesuzerian	2021-04-21 21:46:21+00:00	"Opinions needed: in-laws took 3 yr old too long during an emergency, changed plan, etc..."	"tl;dr: My son loves his grandparents who took him too long. They changed the plan, he's having a blast, and basically I'm butthurt. I am I entirely wrong, partially, or what?

Longer version: wife's parents watched our son for a few days during an emergency, and since I never nailed down details (because emergency chaos) they ended up taking him 3 hours away and dragging it out longer than I liked. The plan for 4-5 days watching him at our home turned into 2 at ours, 2-3 at theirs. Then it became 5 at ours, plus 2 at theirs. Which then became 3 at theirs. ""X-day morning"" became afternoon. Here it is day 8 and I've yet to see my son. 

Partially, what irks me is that we never really needed them to take him away, it was more for them (and him?) than us. I feel they thought they knew what was better for him and were intentionally vague about the plan so they could do it. My wife and I were in a bind and they took advantage of it. 

What also bothers me, maybe selfishly on my part or maybe not, was how attached he became to them and detached from us. We saw him briefly the first time in 5 days for 30 minutes before they left. He wanted nothing to do with me, clutching grandma, yelling at me, obsessed. It was heart-breaking. My wife's parents love him like their own son and he has an absolute blast with them and on their property (complete with farm animals, machines, ponds, other relatives, etc). They also of course indulge in TV and candy and things I wouldn't allow. 

Overall just wondering how excessively big a deal I'm making about this. Wife and I have fought about it the past 2 days. She thinks I'm an insecure selfish asshole and need to move on. But I just love this kid beyond words can convey, missed him, and have trouble balancing my desire to see him happy with that to shape who he becomes. 

In the bigger picture, and for many reasons I won't go into, I can see his grandparents having the overwhelming influence on who he becomes. I think he would be thrilled with that, my wife would, her parents would, everyone would but it wouldn't sit well with me."

My 13 month old has always sprouted teeth early. She already has 4 top, 4 bottom, 1 molar on the lower right and she is now suffering through 1 molar on the lower left. 

She just transitioned to the young toddler room in daycare and today they called me to pick her up because she was inconsolable. They rocked her, hugged her, told her it was okay. I try not to overdo it on the Tylenol, I’ve tried cold washcloths, teething toys, rubber duckies, etc.

I know she will be fine long term but she will be ok and then just start screaming and crying and pulling at her ears. I’ve taken her to the doctor twice and no fever, no sign of ear infection, just teething! 🦷

an0n_lala	2021-04-21 21:10:14+00:00	10 year old daughter refuses to come home because I took away her cell phone	"I share custody of my daughter with her father, it’s basically 50/50. For her birthday in October she was gifted a cell phone against my better judgement but I allowed her to use and took it away as a punishment whenever she was out of line. When she received a failing grade due to not submitting her homework, I told her that if I received another failing grade on her next report card her phone would be confiscated for the entire semester. She failed to get her grades up so I did just that. 

This last weekend, she asked to join her best friend as they were taking a day trip to LA for her birthday. I said sure, she was given $50 for the trip. She asked to have her cell phone for the trip. Now I know she can be fussy in traffic, and I wanted to be able to track her in case of emergencies. So I handed it over but told her she’d be giving it back once she came home. This is the first time she’s had her phone in months.

All while this is happening my father is moving into my house that weekend. She comes home on Sunday in a good mood. She greets her grandfather, helps with maybe two boxes out of the uhual, and retreats to her room to play on her phone.

My father invites us all to lunch. My daughter says a few sideways comments, throws a napkin and drops her orange juice all over the table. At this point I’m a little annoyed. She goes to the restroom to clean up and I grab the phone off the table and put it in my pocket. Upon returning home she takes a three hour nap while we get my dad moved in.

When she wakes up she’s very upset and asks me for the cell phone. I said no, you knew the deal. She starts going off on tangents about all the things she dislikes about me and says she wants to go stay with her father. She’s crying at this point. After trying to ration with her I give up and tell her to leave and not to come back until she is ready to act right. You can probably guess she hasn’t returned.

What would you do in my situation?"

They still can play with my daughter, and in our yard no less, and they seem to have no issue playing with a 13 yo girl from the next street over, but not my son? He is gentle, kind, smart, a great role model for his younger sister, and makes me proud every damn day. It hurts that this woman tells him he can't play with his friends. And it's just her as her husband never minds and even let my son help put up a fence in their yard. I know there's nothing I can do but it pisses me off when a good kid is punished for nothing."

We've seen all the episodes multiple times over. The episode Sleepytime actually makes my daughter cry. This is the only thing that makes her cry outside getting hurt, tantrums, etc. 

Now let me just say, if you've seen this particular episode, it has all the feels. The music is from Holst's, Jupiter, a fairly emotionally invoking piece on its own. The episode is basically an endearing sum up of children growing up.  I actually avoid watching it because I completely sob. I have hidden this from my daughter, she has not seen me cry. For those of you that know this episode, I'm sure plenty of you have cried from it as well, it is superbly written and just hits all those sappy notes of parenting. 

I just want to know if this is something to be concerned about, becoming overcome with sadness at such a young age. I have tried explaining that it's ok, it is just Bingo's dream, she is waking up now to start a new day. We've watched it together and I've explained it the entire episode. No matter what, she always gets sad and cries from it. She has not shown any kind of sadness anywhere else in her life.

For what it's worth, I cry at everything even remotely endearing, which has only amplified since becoming a parent. I suppose I'm just concerned if perhaps my child is feeding off me, and I don't want her to have my anxiety, which I wouldn't wish on anyone. I try to keep things like my anxiety hidden from her. I hope she is like her dad, who never worries or panics. For the most part, she seems to be like him."

Ghanimaofarrakis	2021-04-21 20:48:14+00:00	Is this weird?	"So a few weeks ago I found two new plastic sleds placed on my porch, no note. Sent messages to my family and in laws, no one copped to the gift. I thought maybe a wrong delivery, or they blew away from someone's porch and someone saw them and assumed they were ours. 

Then today I found a wooden snowman decoration with a note attached ""Last day to build a snowman kids"" on the porch. Again family and friends all say it wasn't them. And I don't recognize the handwriting on the note.

So I assume then a neighbour? Except we pretty well keep to ourselves and in the almost decade we've lived in our house we've never really interacted with any neighbours. 

Maybe it's someone trying to be nice, but it feels weird that a stranger has noticed kids live in this house and is gifting them things. I can't figure out if this is sweet or creepy. 

What do you think?"

staycebear30	2021-04-21 20:33:18+00:00	My neighbor thinks I'm horrible..	"Please don't tell me I'm horrible for thinking this. What do you all think?! 

My daughter frequently plays with the girl next door, they are pretty close in age. Daughter is 8, the neighbors daughter is 10. I have rules put on my girl for when she's outside. No leaving the garden and going where I can't see or hear her, and she certainly cannot play on the road behind us, as it's right off the highway and there is a high bridge. Now, this is where I have my concerns...

The neighbors daughter, only 10 years old, always has to bring the 4 year old wherever she goes. These children never have parental supervision and they literally have no boundaries to where they go. It's really not safe in my opinion. Anything could happen. So I spoke with the girls and explained the little one needs to be with their mommy or daddy. Their parents think I was totally in the wrong and now won't allow my daughter to play with theirs because she can't have the 4 year old tag along.  I don't know what to do in this situation. It honestly feel like I have to be outside, babysitting this little one while the big girls play. While their parents are nowhere to be seen. I'm really uncomfortable with a child so little not having supervision while playing on swings and slides. Sorry, it's just how I feel.

Do you think I was in the wrong for this?"

Cut to 2 months ago i log on to instagram to find a message from her telling me i have a son, i was like yeah suuure i do. But reading on i discovered that he has the same heart condition as me(it runs in the family) she was dating someone up until a week before i logged on so he has already been raised by another guy. Furthermore they have only spoken polish around him. Last week i met him for the first time (i still work in Switzerland from time to time) how do i build a bond with him and how can i include my fiancé in this process as well.      

TLDR how can i bond with my now 6mo son?"
gaychitect	2021-04-21 19:47:38+00:00	How do you handle your child wanting to quit a hobby just because it gets harder?	"My youngest son (8), has been taking riding lessons for about a year. His instructor says he is a natural and very good for his age. Recently, he has expressed to us that he wants to quit. When asked why, he said because it’s getting too hard. It’s the only specific reason he can give. As he progresses, he is taught things that are more and more advanced. So yes, it gets harder. However, that pretty much applies to anything. 

In the short term, we told him that we prepay for lessons, and they don’t do refunds (which has the benefit of actually being true). He has to finish the ones we already paid for. All that did was buy us some time.

I’m a firm believer in the fact that forcing kids to do something is one of the quickest ways to make them hate it. It’s just not productive. 

However..... I’m worried about establishing a precedent of it being ok to quit something just because it’s difficult. Things that are fulfilling and worth doing are rarely easy. I don’t want to raise kids that give up as soon as things gets hard. 

I’m stuck between a rock and hard place with two contradicting but equally important principles.

Any ideas?"

ifimhereimrealbored	2021-04-21 19:02:36+00:00	"I'm not a stay at home mom, but my husband forgets that"	"Since Covid, I've been working from ""home"" with our toddler. My husband is an essential worker who still goes into an office. My husband is amazing; he's a great father and partner and he's thoughtful and patient and funny and kind. But sometimes he seems to forget that just because I'm with our kid everyday and I don't go into a physical office, I'm not a stay at home mom.

We're extremely fortunate to have both sets of grandparents within an hour's drive and one of them helps everyday so I can get work done. Some days my son and I drive 40 minutes to my parents', some days my MIL comes to our condo. But the grandparents are in their 70s. So I'm very involved throughout the day giving them breaks, dealing with toddler tantrums, making decisions, changing diapers, planning and cooking meals, begging a toddler to eat, etc. And of course the grandparents have lives of their own, so there's constant rearranging of schedules and changing my working hours to accomodate.

It's the decision fatigue that's killing me. 3 meals a day with my kid, for 13 months. Endless decisions that balance my work, my kid's needs, and the needs of two grandmothers. Plus prioritizing my work for the limited time I have. Add in decisions based on Covid safety - like whether it's ok for my son to go to the park or play outside with a neighbor or go to the grocery store...

So when my husband just gets dressed in the morning and walks out the door, leaving me to pick out weather-appropriate kid clothes, figure out breakfast, pack up, etc. Or when he comes home and asks what's for dinner or says he's too tired to put our son down. Well, I just want to scream. I know this is the age old problems of ""mental load"" falling traditionally on the mom. And he and I have discussed it at length. He tries to help. And he does help, a little. But he just... forgets.

Anyone have words of wisdom for me on how to change or just make peace with the situation?"

Whenever we go in she asks me to make some so she can smash them. Then she’ll say “I smashed the turtle” and kind of look for my reaction. Does the same with magnatiles. She will build a house for her stuffed animal and then kick it over. Is this normal? She also occasionally will cut a piece of paper and bring it to me and say “I broke it”, like she knows it’s wrong. She has a sister with anger issues related to adhd so I’m paranoid that she will have them too

The issue is, he wakes up everyday around 5:00 or 5:30 in morning. We've tried to lay with him or let him cry it out to see if he'll sleep a little more. No dice. He falls asleep either in his high chair, my arms, or the couch by 11:00 the latest and naps for an hour or two. When he wakes up, he refuses to eat lunch. He also picks at his dinner. He is also very crabby during the day.   


This has been going on the past few weeks. 

I'm just wondering if we should be doing something else to have him sleep/eat more. Or is this normal behavior for a toddler?"

He just does whatever he wants, like we used to. He collects pine cones or runs to the playground or whatever. But I can’t leave the stroller to go get him or make sure he is safe.

Livelaughloser2315	2021-04-21 18:07:36+00:00	My child is afraid of other kids. How can I help?	"My 4.5 year old has been in daycares since 6 months old, and was always happy to play with other kids. 

We were in lockdown for 2 months last year and then right after that, she started at a new home daycare with 6 other kids. She likes it there, the kids absolutely adore her, and she likes them too. No cases of bullying whatsoever. The daycare is pretty transparent, and most of the kids are babies and toddlers anyways. 

The problem is that since June last year, she’s been anxious and scared of kids outside her daycare. When we go to the playground (the same one we’ve been going to for years), she refuses to play with the kids, or even climb up the play structures if even a single kid is there. 
 
She wants to play on the structures, but seeing other kids there makes her scared. She’ll run away if a kid even approaches her. She tells me “I’m scared of the kids” but she won’t explain why. 

I always tell her that I’m right there with her to help if needed, that she’s safe, the kids are nice, etc, but to no avail. Sometimes I even try to talk to the kids and “break the ice”, and they’re usually SO friendly and willing to play with her but she flat out rejects them. I’m out of strategies here! 

Even the daycare has noticed her strange fear of outsiders too, and they’ve expressed their concern to me. 

It’s absolutely heartbreaking to see her WANT to play at the park but not have the courage to do it just because other kids are there. I’m feeling hopeless as nothing I’m doing is helping her overcome this. 

Any other parents gone through this and can offer help? Is a mental health counselor useful for 4 year olds?"
Vulgarbrando	2021-04-21 17:53:19+00:00	Live in nephew	"So my sister in law and nephew moved in with me and my wife, my sister in law is in and out of a divorce and working 2nds, my wife commutes to work, and I am a stay at home dad to my 1.5 year old son. 

My nephew went to schooling out of state and in order to enroll in schooling my sister in law needs to change her address to a one in the school district. So he instead is enrolled in online learning for his school. He is not an academic, understandable I didn’t have eyes on me at all times for schooling or my downtime in between, here is the issue, he isn’t even trying.

My sister in law has taken away all of his stuff, he has chores to do at my house which I would rather do to get them done, and I feel obligated to try and get him on the right path, but that is extremely difficult while trying to raise my own. He “does” his school work for competition and has poor grades. He always says his goal is to be able to live on his own so he doesn’t have to do school or housework. 

I don’t really know if I do anything to help the kid I have tried with his homework I usually attempt at my sons nap, one day it rolled into a 4 hour geometry lesson which resulted in nothing. His mom and him have the same argument over him being the punching bag of this divorce, of which he isn’t because he has gotten a two week vacation during the first portion of living with me in Minecraft world. He now either pretends to do school work or takes naps. Him and my sister in law have laid out a schedule with rewards, and me and my wife have tried to reward him with shows to watch with us if school work is completed.

I know 14 is a tough age, and I know that sometimes letting go and learning from failure is a big step in maturity, but with what I have tried to tell him is a “fresh start” he seems to want the easiest way back to gaming.

Any advice Reddit parents? Is it a time thing like toddlers, where if we keep to this system he’ll catch on or am I at a loss?"
lhousekey	2021-04-21 17:39:38+00:00	What to do when your kid is ungrateful about everything?	"My 8 yo daughter came home from a sleepover (with a friend she loves) and had nothing but negative things to say about it. Didn’t like the food, didn’t like the games they played, just didn’t have a great time. She was literally bawling because it was such a disappointment. She started crying even thinking about how they “ruined” her taco by adding sour cream in it with cabbage. 

I usually say I’m sorry it didn’t go as expected, but you need to think of the positives. I usually have her make a list of things she was grateful for. Often that causes more stress because she just wants to sit with her negativity for a while. 

I am possibly a toxic optimist, I’m not sure. But I can’t relate to wanting to sit and stew and agonize about something that long; crying and screaming like a newborn. 

I’m trying to balance letting her sit in her negative feelings and bring her back to reality; nothing was objectively wrong with the sleepover and she needs to adjust her expectations. We worry that she’s never going to be happy with anything. She reacts like this to every small disappointment. 

How do you parents navigate this?"

lalucklady	2021-04-21 17:29:44+00:00	I feel triggered by my 7 year old's emotions	"So my son is 7 years old. He lives in his feelings. He has no qualms about crying, and has always been emotionally expressive (I'm upset because.... I'm crying because I feel...etc). If there are times when we say ""dont cry"", he will defensively remind us that it's ok to have feelings. 

I honestly love this about him. But it can be draining to deal with someone who leans into their feelings all the time. While he is communicative, I worry about his emotional regulation because it feels like he has a hard time soothing himself. If hes upset he always needs to cry or meltdown about it and then have a conversation about it. The conversation is less draining, but the meltdowns trigger me. I've always been super sensitive to sounds and his crying is like nails on a chalk board. Especially being in quarantine, this has been exacerbated.  Hes home more and therefore feels comfortable in expressing all his emotions all the time.  (He does not melt like this at school, usually). Also, he's with me all the time and I'm trying to balance working from home and dealing with his school work and I don't really have a break. 

His dad is in his masters program and has finals coming up. Usually he's solid in navigating my son's emotions, but he's so stressed I feel like I'm a little caught between two emotionally intense people. We dont live close enough to family to have that kind of support. My kid is only in school for two more weeks, so outsourcing help at this point isn't really a solid solution. 

I need help in not being so reactive to my son's meltdowns and probably some help with his emotional regulation. Any tools or insights would be amazing."

I don't mind giving him one but most stuff I see selling are either CDs (which are a PITA to purchase) or require some apple/spotify/whatever subscription.

He doesn't have a phone or any other online subscription stuff and I'm not keen on getting him any of those.  But I'm also not keen on buying CDs (do kids do that anymore?)

I was hoping to get some view points and thoughts on my 14 year old SS (Step Son). We recently took full custody of him this past school year for him to focus on a school near us. Since then, he has mainly been remote (Due to COVID) and has been failing every class. Not only does he fail, he will not accept help, he lies about his grades and just doesn't seem to care.

We have offered him assistance, taken him to tutors (Home and Away), and nothing seems to help. He just will not accept someone helping him. We recently had him tested and his math and reading are still at middle school levels.

To only add to that, over the past several months, he has increased his lying to us and not taking accountability of his actions. We actually have him on camera doing things that he denies even doing. We have been in and out of both family and individual therapy. We have tried positive and negative reinforcement to no avail. My marriage is on the fritz due to all of this stress.

Lately, we noticed him saying he ""lost"" money that we had given him (He earned) and noticed him still money from our savings jar. However, the other day, we found that he had taken edibles (too much) to the point of where he was shaking and thought he was really sick. The only way we knew is because he was scared. We are at a loss of what to do. We recently took his phone and went through it to only find more lies. I understand teenagers try things, however, that coupled with the fact that he is failing everything, lying, not taking accountability, screams a lot more to me then just experimenting. 

We talked to a child therapist who said that we should take everything and not allow him for the time being to talk with his friends until his behavior reverses.

We are at a loss as we have tried to do everything."

eight13atnight	2021-04-21 16:10:40+00:00	I accidentally F*$ked with my kid	"It was getting late in the day and my kid was repeatedly asking to watch the ""Cars"" movie. He's 2 yo and obsessed with the racing scenes in it. 

Because he's becoming obsessed, my wife and I decided that we should probably back away from watching too much television. Lately he's becoming more and more pushy about watching. 

After telling him repeatedly that we aren't going to watch TV that night, I thought it would otherwise be fun to play some songs from the sound track for him as background music, instead of staring at the black mirror. 

Boy was I wrong.....

He heard the intro song ""Real Gone"" by Sheryl Crow. He stopped playing abruptly, JUMPED up, RAN to the TV, and immediately started BAWLING that the movie was NOT in fact playing. He carried on for 15 minutes begging to watch Cars. 

I felt sooooo terrible about it. I didn't think through the fact that he doesn't understand the difference between a movie and music, etc. To him it's all just a ""thing"" that he enjoys and it's all lumped into one blob."
machetecobra	2021-04-21 16:01:04+00:00	Parenting in the Pandemic? Or just a not social toddler?	"My son is about to turn 16 months. He's 'normal' on most levels. He babbles with me constantly, he plays with me and alone,and hes a fantastic eater. He's slow to start walking on his own, but he's making great strides and just about there. My concern is that he doesn't want to be around anyone else. In February, his father (my husband) had to move for work. We still see him every couple weeks for a few days at a time and he likes to be around his dad too. But he screams if any other adult tries to hold him or if I need to leave him for any reason.  He sees his grandma every week since birth and he's still not warmed up to her. I try to go to outdoor playgrounds when I can, and I can't afford to get him in a daycare to socialize  with other kids. Any ideas on how to help him be more sociable? Or should I keep doing what I'm doing and wait? He's a sweet and energetic boy, I'm just worried he's too attached to me."
BrainQuilt	2021-04-21 15:52:35+00:00	"My son is pretty energetic and aggressive, what are some good sports options?"	"My son (7M) has a lot of energy and is aggressive. He doesn't ever try to hurt anyone, but he always wants to wrestle, or fight. We are looking into some sports where he can direct all this energy. 

We originally were thinking wrestling because his father did wrestling as a kid and he said it helped him a lot, but there aren't really any options for wrestling nearby aside from the high school team. 

He's done basketball before and although he liked it enough, he doesn't seem interested in continuing. 

Just looking for some different ideas, someone told me jiu jitsu but I don't really know much about it."

I know I’m only 2 months postpartum, and while everyone is telling me to be kind to myself, it’s nearly impossible not to hate seeing myself right now. I love my baby more than anything in the world, and I’m so happy to be a mom, but I really am missing out on some self love. I guess, I just wanted to know I’m not alone.

STcmOCSD	2021-04-21 15:21:27+00:00	Am I wrong for thinking parents shouldn’t risk their child getting others sick?	"I have close friends who have a child just about 2 months different in age from my 1 year old. He’s been sick this week, and both his grandmothers who normally watch him are now ill from him. They asked me to watch their kid today while they work (I am a SAHM) running the risk of now getting me (I am pregnant) and my child sick too. 

I always thought the rule of thumb was if your kid is sick you stay home with them? That’s what my husband and I did while I was working. We’d never ask anyone to watch our kid while she was sick, one of us would call off. They both can afford to call off work (whereas my husband and I had to scrape by even when we got full paychecks).

I don’t know I just feel like as a parent I wouldnt risk getting someone else sick because my kid is sick. I kind of thought that was the normal but am I wrong here? They weren’t too upset that I said no but said they’d keep looking for someone else to watch him so they can work."
aitaainta	2021-04-21 15:20:23+00:00	Tween with Obsessive Violent Fantasies	"I’m hoping someone else has been through this or has some advice.

We have a 12 year old with autism, ADHD and depression.  He’s on medication for the depression, which has helped a lot, and has been in counseling with a social worker, which is less helpful because he never tells her much and just assures her he’s fine.  The truth is that he has become fixated on violence, and has extremely disturbing, extremely detailed fantasies about murder that he thinks about constantly.  The targets are random internet celebrities who he hates for no clear reason.  We have tried repeatedly to explain these are real people who have done nothing to him, if he doesn’t like something he can ignore it, and there’s a big difference between disliking someone (okay) and wanted to kill them (never okay).  I am terrified he will somehow get access to weapons someday and do something.  We do everything we can to limit his internet time at home, but with the pandemic, he’s in school all day on his laptop, and the teachers can’t babysit what he’s doing every minute.  His whole life, he has been intense and difficult, and would get stuck on certain subjects, but they never scared me like this does.  All of the mental health counseling places we’ve called are either fully booked until the fall, or cost far more than we can afford (one place told me today it was $300/hour, no insurance accepted).

Or bite whatever is in his hand really hard and his face will turn red. I ignore him when this happens bc I don’t want him to think it’s okay to be that way towards little things. Everyone close to me seems to think it’s normal, but I don’t think it is, idk why it’s just the way he gets so mad and throws a fit like that. And just recently I’ve noticed that when I smack his hand and tell him no when he’s grabbing something he’s not supposed to, he’ll smack me back, but I don’t know what to do after that bc I’m not going to smack his hand again and make him think it’s a game. I guess I’m just worried bc his father has anger issues (were not together anymore) and I don’t want my son to be that way, although I probably can’t help it."
Sithfacedxx	2021-04-21 15:08:22+00:00	What are you supposed to do when punishments don't work?	"Kid is 15. 

What are you actually suppose to do to discipline a child who doesn't care about being disciplined? It's the good ol tale of: once a kid realizes that punishments only work if you follow them, you lose all power in the situation. 

We're at a loss of what to do anymore. 

My boyfriend's son has recently become very troubled. He doesn't live with us, but was sent to live with us for a few weeks about 2 months ago, by his mother. He didn't want to transfer to school out here and we couldn't pick up his medication because he's not on our insurance (too expensive out of pocket). The reason he was sent to stay with us in the first place is because he was caught smoking, skipping class (hiding in the bathroom all day), fighting with step dad, running away and giving his pills away to his friends. Grounding him and taking away his phone obviously doesn't work. Literally the day after he went back to his mom's house, he stole a bottle of Tequila and brought it to school and got him and his friends drunk. he was arrested and currently has charges pending against him. He's now been ""excused from school"" pretty much for the rest of the school year, sounds like. He's also run away again, after ditching school yesterday. This will be the third runaway since I've been with the father, which is less than a year. Last time he ran away he admitted himself into the children's psych ward and had to stay for 7 days."

And now we’ve done a full 180 and she can’t stand wearing them! Nothing I do keeps them on, I’ve gotten dozens and dozens of different kinds(zippers, sandals, tennis shoes, flip flops and even shoes with characters on them), tried to tie them on her feet, Velcroed them differently and no luck. She seems to just want to run free, but with summer I’m afraid she’s going to get stung by a bee or hurt her feet!

ButteryCrumpetz	2021-04-21 14:46:54+00:00	17 month old cries if asked to say something	"*please no judgey passive aggressive comments*

He babbles like he’s trying to say sentences and is really vocal otherwise. He understands really really well. 

He doesn’t actually say any words though. He knows what many objects around the house are and understands actions like “can I have a kiss” “can I have a hug” “come here” “wave” “clap hands” and many other things. 

Whenever anyone asks him to say something though, he gets upset and cries about it. For example, “Say Mama” he will cry and looked insulted or annoyed almost so I’ll stop bc I don’t want to annoy him further.

Should I be concerned? Is this normal?"
bombsquadreject03	2021-04-21 14:45:05+00:00	My friend hits her kids	"My best friend of over 10 years is, like me, a mother of two children, roughly 13 and 10. My children are the same age. We have watched each other raise our children and over the last couple years, I've noticed her hitting the kids more. When I say hit, I mean she will strike them in the head and has hit them in other areas. I don't consider this ""spanking"" I consider it smacking a child in the face and head. When she does this, it is often out of absolute frustration and accompanied by close proximity yelling and criticism. Her partner also hits the children. From what I have observed, the most common reason for hitting them comes from ""back talk"" or unacceptable attitude. 

I do not hit or allow my parents to hit my children. I don't accept hitting in my house, including between the children. I am amazed that this incredible woman and my friend would be hitting her children like this but her stance is that she can ""parent how she wants, and I can parent how I want"". 

I thought we (as society) agreed that hitting children was bad and often a secret occurrence that people didn't do in front of other people. Is this still considered an acceptable form of discipline for some people? Am I over-reacting? 

Thanks for reading."

The one thing I am able to do with her consistently (an activity her mother doesn't enjoy doing herself) is reading with her.  Yesterday she had a late nap, so she was still awake when I got home.  And what did she want?  She hit me with a book.  ""Read!"" she says.  Sometimes it's the same book multiple times. I ask her if she wants to read another, and she actually brings the current book to the shelf and grabs a different one.  Since she has my attention, she hands me the book, grabs a blanket and curls up in my lap, and commands me to ""Read!""  
Four books read at least twice later, she's ready to sleep."

"I have a 6 month old and we have had trouble with one eye getting goopy from time to time. We have even had her eye sealed shut 7-8 times since she was born. Usually we just wipe it in the morning and the rest of the day is fine. Dr. Said it’s normal and tear ducts can take some time to open up. 2 weeks ago she had a slight fever  for a few hours, Tylenol knocked it right out, and we noticed her eye was consistently bad throughout the day. We went to the dr and she gave us some ointment but said it probably wasn’t working because it’s a viral infection causing it. The whites of her eyes are not red but the eye is swollen and the past 13 days it is consistently gunked up. The dr keeps saying there’s not much I can do other than a warm compress, keeping it clean and massaging the inside of the eye. She’s willing to see us again in a week but does anyone else have experience with this? Poor kid keeps rubbing her eye and I know it’s not comfortable for her."
bartdidit	2021-04-21 14:20:27+00:00	Nap skipping with me 2.5 year old	"My son's schedule used to be like clockwork. He always naps around 1-1:30 pm to 3-3:30 pm. He naps a minimum of 2 hours, and sometimes even more (we would wake him up) 

For the past 3 weeks, he started to skip naps. Our routine didnt change at all but he started to play in his bed refusing to sleep. I would say he is napping 3 to 4 times a week max. If we went to the beach or had a physical activity in the weekend before his nap time, he would sleep with no problems. 

He did skip naps before but that would be no more than 5 times a month (when he wakes up late in the morning) 

We have no problem to stop his nap, the problem is that he gets really cranky starting 3 pm and becomes very moody and overtired. He refuses to be put in bed around this time which makes is hard for us. We tried pushing his nap to 2pm without any success.  Today he woke up at 6:15, went to the daycare and refused to nap. 

Do we keep on trying to just stop his nap ?"

anonymous_female10	2021-04-21 13:33:22+00:00	How independent is your almost 11 year old? Thoughts?	"This may be long. Buckle up as opinions are GREATLY needed and martial issues are coming of it. I am a stay-at-home mom. My 10 (almost 11) year old was struggling in school since Kindergarten. He was more immature than the other students as he started school early. We finally discovered he has ADHD like his father. We held him back his 4th grade year which was this year, got an IEP,  and tried medication. It has done WONDERS. He is now making all A's and B's and has matured so much this year. He has also became a little more independent this year. He wakes himself up (I am also up but do not have to wake him up), brushes his teeth, let's the dogs out to potty, grabs his breakfast, and gets them water while I do my own morning routine and feed the dogs. He is online learning because of covid and goes straight to class on time and switches classes on schedule. He may need an occassional reminder but other than that does it on his own. After school he goes straight to do his chores, does an hour of active activity, has dinner, does homework, then get xbox time before bath and bed. He is also on a billiards team with his dad, grandmother, and her SO which is every Sunday.

It is very peaceful and any arguments or disagreements with him between us is rare. Now he is still a child so occasionally if there needs to be a punishment (lose of xbox time) he will of course be upset. But his upset is never temper tantrums, screaming, or anything of the sort. Just 10 minutes of pouting and silent tears then he is back to normal. But my mother in law (which is now seeping into my husband so we are having martial clashes) is soooo upset, obsessed, and concerned about it. Why? I am not sure. She seems to have a problem that I am not heavily monitoring him during school hours though he is making great grades, has been complimented by all his teachers, and is doing great at his schedule. When she has needed to watch him she will listen and sit and criticize EVERY SINGLE THING HE DOES. His handwriting. His participation in class. How he does his work. She also says I act more as his friend than parent. Why? Because I do not have to be down his throat every waking minute? Everything he does is wrong to her. If he talks he needs to stop butting in adult convos. If he doesn't she is offended and complaining he isn't present. Even though he only gets a set amount of xbox time which he earns it kills her that he gets to play and says he plays too much but then she also says he needs it for stress relief. Complains he doesn't play outside enough. We live in a neighborhood with all elderly and he is an only child along with we can't just have play dates or play with random kids because WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC.

It has gotten to where I can't stand to be around her (I have to be 1-3 times a week) because all she does is complain and put him down which now my husband has started doing. He knit picks him and will start conflict for no reason. They say he will be out of control by the time he is a teenager because ""he is too independent and thinks he is the boss."" What? He doesn't do anything he is not supposed to, asks permission for everything, has never been violent or aggressive to any adult or child, he is very sensitive and cares about others feelings, and is responsible for his age but will be out of control? My husband and I are now at odds and are having major arguments over parenting which was never a problem until he became close with his mother. Who was out of half of his life after she abandoned her 2 kids for drugs. Ironic huh? To be fair she is now I believe 9 years sober but missed from I believe when he was 15 up until about 2 or 3 years ago. He almost 30."
FortuneAndFae	2021-04-21 13:09:37+00:00	My 5 yo is having irrational fears while granddad is dying of cancer.	"My 5 year old boy is all around a great kid. We rarely ever have a behavioral issue. He is confident, makes friends easily, loves playing on his baseball team, and loves reading together. We have a very loving family. All four grandparents and his aunts and uncles adore him. We are very close, but especially close with my in-laws. They live down the road 2 minutes and we usually see them at least 3-5 times a week. They spend a lot of time with my son and they’re great people.

Like everyone else in 2020, my son experienced some pretty significant life changes. He was in a 2-day a week preschool program that ended abruptly with covid. Two family pets died. We were hit by a tornado that damaged our family business pretty badly and damaged some trees in our yard. My MIL got skin cancer on her face and had to go through radiation. My in-laws both got covid and my FIL ended up in the ICU very close to death.Then about a month after being released from the hospital, my FIL was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the end of the year, we found out that I am pregnant and we will get to have another baby this summer. 

So, yeah, lots of big changes and confusing things happening, not to mention covid in general. Socially distancing from friends, our local parks were closed all last spring and summer, and mask-wearing are all strange things for any kid.

We navigated as best as we could. I read lots of parenting articles, books and magazines. We were gently honest with our son about everything that was happening and made sure that he understood that he has a huge support system. We reassured him that he has a big family and we all love him very much. We used clear language to explain granddads cancer. 

Cancer and chemo changed my FIL completely, and changed our entire family. My FIL has been miserably sick and uncharacteristically frightened. He was a very very active man in our community, always busy. After cancer he stayed in his room almost all the time. He became scared to be alone, so my MIL had to stay with him all the time. This meant wayyyy less time with my son, way less family dinners, and my son has been disappointed that granddad can’t play anymore. We’ve adapted the best we can. We have spent more time with friends and my parents to try to make up for losing so much time with my in-laws. And my in-laws are careful to avoid being grim when my son is there, and try to have fun and focus on only him.

About 4 weeks ago we found out FILs chemo is no longer working. He made the decision to end treatment, which of course absolutely broke our hearts but we understand. Pretty quickly his pain became unbearable and his hospice nurses have had to increase his medicine. The last few weeks he has mostly been in bed, sleeping or very groggy and incoherent. We explained to my son that granddads chemo wasn’t working anymore. With lots of other cancers chemo can get rid of the cancer, but granddads cancer is different and the chemo can’t make him better. We explained he is in pain meds and that’s why he talks funny.

All of a sudden, about the same time the chemo stopped working, my son developed some irrational fears. We had a bad thunderstorm one night with tornado warnings. That reminded him of the tornado we had last year. He started to get so worried all of a sudden that we would get another tornado that he will panic if he sees a dark cloud. He will wake up in the middle of the night in tears and he insists I check the weather. He checks the weather radar on my phone several times a day. He keeps asking me to tell him we will never have a tornado, which I can’t because that would be a lie. I finally calmed those fears a bit by explaining that we don’t typically get BAD tornadoes in our area, just small tornadoes that damage trees. Maybe a tiny bit of a lie because about once every 5-10 years we have a pretty bad one.

Then he started on the lights. We had a string of globe lights upstairs in our house and I noticed one day after they’d been left on for a few days that they were a little hot. So I unplugged them and mentioned something about it to my husband. Our son overheard and came to the conclusion that any of the lights in our house can cause a fire. We threw away the string of lights, but that wasn’t enough. Now he will wake up on the middle of the night and cry, worried that a light is on somewhere in the house. He will panic at bedtime and insist we turn off every single light before he goes to bed.

I can’t help but think that these new irrational fears are connected to his granddad dying. We haven’t actually told him that granddad is going to die yet. We have been trying to deliver the bad news by degrees. Now I’m afraid when we DO tell him, he will start to fixate on sickness like he has fixated on tornadoes and fires. I check in with him often and ask him if he wants to talk about granddad or anything else. We will sometimes show emotion in front of him, but we try to keep from really dwelling on what’s happening so that we can laugh and have fun without it seeming forced to him. 

I’m not sure if we are doing something wrong. Should I explain to him now that granddad is dying, and redirect his fears to what might really be causing them? Or is it possible that his new fears have nothing to do with granddad? Maybe I’ve made his fears worse by listening to them and treating them seriously instead of “nipping them in the bud”?

I am looking for a counselor in our area to help. I am afraid if we start counseling it will blow things more out of proportion but I also don’t want his fears to escalate any further. Until we find a counselor to get in with I would like to make sure we don’t make things any worse. 

Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated."
PepperAlternative905	2021-04-21 13:03:46+00:00	"DH wants son to go to Preschool, I want him to wait"	"My son is 3.5, and in our area, we send them to preschool ages 3 &amp; 4. He has a winter birthday, so he missed the cutoff last year - this would he his first year to go. My husband is ADAMANT that my son go this fall, and I am just not on board. Husband's reasoning to send him just consist of ""It's time,"" ""He's ready,"" or ""He needs to go.""

I want to start by saying this has nothing to do with me being super attached and not wanting my baby to leave. I love my baby boy, but I'm just not that kind of clingy mom. Lol. I feel like I have practical reasons... 

First off, he is not potty trained. This has been a HUGE HUGE battle with him and we have tried several times, several different ways, with no success yet. I am hoping to get this resolved this summer though, fingers crossed.  Second, we are still under mask requirements where we are and my son just will not wear one. That is mostly my fault - I am a SAHM, and spent most of 2020 pregnant, so we didn't go anywhere pretty much all last year, so he didn't really have time or need to get used to it. Third, I have received several comments from a variety of LEGITIMATE sources (i.e. pediatrician) that he is of above average in terms of intellectual development. I have tried very hard to constantly work with him to make sure he has a head start for when his schooling would start. Lastly, like I said, I am a SAHM, so it's not like we would need to send him for financial reasons to get out of having to pay for daycare, or send him because we need to find somewhere for him to be during the day.

Now, I 100% see the benefits of sending him to preschool, for learning and for socialization. I DO believe it is important to send him. And if the world were ""normal"" right now, I would have 0 issues with sending him, even not potty trained! But that's just not the case. I would prefer to wait a year, for him to go when he is 4 and get 1 year instead of 2. Who knows where we will be in a year? Hopefully better than now. But if things aren't different by then, I will begrudgingly let him go, anyway. By then he will hopefully be able to understand better the need for a mask and will be able to use the potty. But I just don't  see why it is so dang important to send him this year. 

To make matters worse, my SIL (Husband's Sister) is a teacher, and she just keeps repeating over and over  about how he needs to go, and that just fuels my husband's fire. But she doesn't have kids! She just doesn't get what it's like to worry like a mother. Lol. 

So, am I being unreasonable for not wanting to send him now, or do you feel that my points are valid?"

Inside we have a large play yard with table top toys so she stands and plays and every so often I jump in and play with her, then get back to chores, etc.

So what do you guys use for outside sit or stand play?"
DragonRider87	2021-04-21 12:30:12+00:00	Rant about my threenager	"I love her to bits and typically she's very sweet and wanting to please and hates me being upset with her, but this morning she's driving me up the damn wall. It started with waking me up at 6:10. That's 50 minutes earlier than usual. Not off to a good start. Refused to let me put underwear on her. Fine, I set it aside and she put it on 15 minutes later, fortunately not having peed in the diaper yet. Then she demanded food, I gave her a fruit bar, she usually loves them. She handed it back to me 3/4s eaten saying ""I don't want anymore."" Which would be fine, except less than an hour later, she demands that she wants to eat again. And I make her oatmeal. That she almost immediately tosses in the garbage! And in between all the nonsense with food, she needs to go pee, I see her grabbing at herself, but refuses to sit on the potty until I'm practically in tears. That plus all the whining, screaming, fighting with her sisters and I am so done with her. And it's only 8:30 am!"
BSGBramley	2021-04-21 12:24:55+00:00	Help with deciphering my baby	"Hey Reddit,

First time dad here. Wondering if someone can shed light onto a question we are having. 

Our firstborn was born on X-mas day, so is nearing the 4 month mark. So far he has been exclusively breast fed, and minus some early teething pains a pleasure. He rarely cries or makes a fuss.

Recently, since last Sunday he has started to really shout. his cooing was always so quite and now he shouts 'AHH' at first we thought maybe he is finding his voice. But we also realized he hasn't pooed in 10 Days. We know babies don't poo as often while being breastfed, but Charlie usually goes every 6 days... Day 7 was when he started shouting.

I just wanted to know if we should be worried or do anything? I don't want to be a overconcerned parent, as everywhere says don't worry as he is breastfed, they don't get constipated. And honestly he seems fine in himself. he is happy, sleeping well, seems to be eating. wees regularly etc. But we also don't want to brush it under the rug and ignore it if it is a problem (or if ignored could become one later down the line) 

Anyway, thanks for you help all :)"
Abcdefgwhat	2021-04-21 12:23:37+00:00	Crying a lot?	"So, I mostly just have a question for mums in here. Before I got pregnant with our twins, I very rarely cried. My partner had seen me cry about 3 times total in the time we were together, that was in spite of me having a severe depression the first while.

But ever since I was pregnant I cry very often now. At least once a week. I'd say probably 3x a week lol. I'm not depressed (I know how that feels) and the boys are 20 months old now, so it's not a post partum thing. Has pregnancy just changed me?

Any mums with similar experiences?"
Ambartenen	2021-04-21 11:45:16+00:00	"Sleep regression, I think?"	"Baby Girl is 14 months old now. I was pretty strict with sleep training using their Ferber method. Around 9 months we achieved sleeping through the night for the most part. At 12 months we took her off formula completely and we had 1 week of hell, but have since experienced 7 weeks of great sleep (obviously hiccups where she clearly was in pain from cutting a new tooth/nightmare/overly wet diaper). 

Cue the past 3 nights. Waking up every 40 minutes, cry-talking to herself, not
Self soothing, uninterested in milk/water AND does not want to be held. She seems to want me to stand at her crib and pat her back, after 15 min she goes down, only to arise again 40 min later. 


Anyone else experience this? Any tips? I’m so exhausted y’all."

She doesn't ever flap her hands. Being the poorly informed parent I feel that I am, I'm wondering if this is something to worry about, autism or not. Should we mention this to her pediatrician?

Flocculencio	2021-04-21 11:14:02+00:00	"6 year old says ""I'm annoying but I don't know why"""	"He's in the first year of Primary school and has been generally enjoying it. However he keeps saying that his group members (they're divided into fixed groups in class for breakout activities and such) keep saying he's annoying.

The kids he plays with in our neighborhood playground after school (some, not all, are from the same school) also apparently say he's annoying and from what I've seen do keep excluding him. 

The trouble is that I can see why they might feel this- kid tends to be very loudly opinionated and gets fixed on specific ideas but at the same time isn't very good at getting other kids to follow along. Simultaneously he craves approval from them so isn't the type who can shrug off kids not wanting to do his thing and just follow along with theirs.

MadMads1122	2021-04-21 10:47:09+00:00	Daycare mood swings and interrupted sleep - 18mo	"Hello! My daughter has very recently started daycare. She is 18 months old, and appears to very much enjoy herself while at the facility. No tears, eats well, fights naptime a little but still sleeps during her regular naptime that she had at home as well. When I pick her up at the end of the day, she immediately bursts into tears and clings to me. She is happy and talkative for the ride home, and then is a spiraling ball of temper tantrums for the remainder of the evening. She also started waking up multiple times during the night - just needing a quick snuggle before going back to bed. 

The broken nighttime sleep could definitely be a minor sleep regression, which I anticipated at this age. The temper tantrums and lack of play at home are what's concerning me most. Has anyone else experienced a shift in their child's mood after joining a daycare?"

She isn’t quite old enough to fully understand directions so I don’t even know how to communicate certain things to her. She does spend time with other babies (whom she loves, she’s very extroverted and loves people) so I know that she might not initially hate the baby. But with this she also is very very attention wanting. She loves to be snuggled, held, etc. I’m getting nervous as my due date approaches on how I’ll be able to parent two babies when my oldest is already a lot to handle. She’s high energy and loves to play and run around. I’ll be by myself most of the time so I’ll have to care for two small children while healing post partum.

RufTed28	2021-04-21 07:02:26+00:00	Baby rarely engages with us	"My 11, nearly 12 week old baby rarely engages with us. It was identified at his 8 week GP developmental check that he still wasn't social smiling. He finally smiled at around 10 weeks, however he only really smiles at us perhaps once every few days and it's very hit and miss.

He also rarely makes eye contact with us, and will go out of his way to avoid looking at us (if we move to be in his eye line he will quickly move away). He's fascinated by the walls/ceiling/pictures on the walls/inside cover of his pram and will give them lovely smiles.

He similarly doesn't track us/objects of interest with his eyes very well; about 90% of the time when we try to encourage this he's staring off into the distance. He doesn't look at us when we come into the room, and shows little interest in anything we show him- he just stares past it instead.

He passed his newborn hearing test, and passed the eye checks at the development check up.

My GP has now referred him to a pediatrician and I can't stop worrying and feeling upset about it; sure that it means he's got autism. I know they can't test for this until much later on, but the anxiety is really getting to me. My health visitor isn't interested and keeps just saying nothing can be done about it. Due to covid I've missed out on meeting parents with babies the same age as mine, so can't really make a comparison to see how their babies are interacting.

winnietheprincess	2021-04-21 06:33:27+00:00	What day is it?	"My husband and I welcomed our first child on April 2nd,  he is now 2 almost 3 weeks old and I am stupid in love with him. 
I am exclusively breastfeeding and this means I am up at least every 2 hours (3 if I get lucky) if I sleep at all. On top of this, he screams anytime my husband holds him, and instantly calms once I hold him again. 
The entire 2 weeks he has had 0 issues sleeping in his bassinet...up until 2 days ago. He must be held whilehe sleeps...and by only me. So little dude and I have shacked up in the recliner in our living room. 
But I am frigging exhausted. 
It's impossible to sleep in fear of something happening to him, a blanket creeping over his face, him falling. 
And my husband....he peacefully sleeps. Stretched out, no cramped arms, comfy. 
Don't get me wrong I love baby cuddles, but omg I miss my bed. 
I haven't slept in 24 hours and hubby is sleeping on the couch en route to his 8 hours. I guess he felt bad I haven't been able to sleep in our bedroom, but honestly seeing him sleep while I've got none is just making me so jealous/angry/grrrrr.
If he was in our bedroom I'd at least not have my face rubbed into it. I know his intentions are good but I'm losing it!!
I also know it isn't his fault our son is very clingy towards me, but I'd kill for a break like he gets. I really just needed to vent cause its no use to be upset at him for things out of his control. And it's useless for both of us to be totally sleep deprived and miserable."
katt_atonic	2021-04-21 06:03:02+00:00	10 year old boy with many issues...	"So my stepson has massive issues. 

This week alone, he was late to school and had to come home (walks to school), forgot his homework, left my car door open and completely ruined my passenger seat and carpet (it rained overnight), threw a glass bottle and broke a 4K 65 inch smart tv, forgets or refuses to shower and brush his teeth, constantly loses things, etc. 

This is his typical behavior- low to no impulse control, and zero attentiveness. He also has very few friends at school. 

Also of concern, we bought him a new puppy, which is 2 months old- the puppy is constantly running under our feet and I accidentally stepped on him, making him yelp in pain for a minute. He started cracking up with laughter.

He will show some remorse, but any talking to goes in one ear and out the other. He can be a good kid but he obviously had lots of issues. Would a child psychologist be rational here? Any tips?"
Linorelai	2021-04-21 06:02:01+00:00	How to get the baby to sleep with his hands free?	"Ok, here is the problem.

My 6 m.o. baby sleeps in a sleeping bag (idk if this is what you call it in English, it's a height-length fabric bag with a zipper)

Without it he used to wake himself up with his hands, and with regular swadding he used to uncover himself, free his hands and again, wake himself up. So I thought, this was a solution - he can move, but can't reach the face.

But now, that he doesn't have the moreau reflex, I thought I could put him to bed unbagged. The most common advice is to start teaching the unswadded sleep with letting one hand out. 

If i put him already sleeping, he reaches his face, rubs it, puts his hand in his mouth, and wakes up. 

And if I put him sleepy, ready to black out, he again wakes up immediately and starts to actively play with the blanket, with his clothes, with the wall of the crib, with everything around him. And no matter how sleepy he was, it's an instant switch on to play mode.

I tryed to lay my hand on his chest to hold his hand until he's asleep, but he protests.

So it's either a protesting cry if I hold him, or an active play if I don't.

I've been adviced to let him play to discover the crib, so that it wasn't new for him and he'd stop being so enthusiastic. But it contradicts another common advice to keep the bed exclusively for sleeping, and not for playing, so that there wasn't an association bed=play. 

Any ideas? What do I do?

I am letting him explore rn. Hope, it's not a mistake..."
MaslerB	2021-04-21 05:03:29+00:00	Six year and school anxiety	"Monday morning my 6 year old (first grader) had a rough morning upon arriving at school. He told my wife he hated himself and slapped himself in the head a couple times. Then refused to get out of the car while crying. He is usually the tough type, hardly ever crying. 

I spoke to him after school and he did admit a kid had been rougly shoving past him and telling him to get out of his way while in the halls. Though he said he wasn't scared of the kid he was reluctant to tell me. We've spoken to his teacher about this and action has been taken thus far.

He had a better morning Tuesday but still showed reluctance. He is his normal self while at home which ranges from hyper/goofy to stubborn/stoic (he's our stubborn one). 

He keeps asking for a break from school. This is where my wife and I seem to be at odds. She wants to give him the break while I do not. I understand her perspective but I do not want to keep him home and then have a full blown meltdown when it's time to return. At a risk of sounding cold, our kids have the afternoons (with no homework right now) and weekends as their break from school and I find school important for social development and forming routines.

Overall I'm worried for him and just want to help and understand. I don't really know what to do as we haven't faced this situation as parents so I'd like constructive responses rather than bashing ones. We're doing our best to help him as we want nothing but the best for all of our children but any advice or relatable experiences would be greatly appreciated."

Story of the day, I posted in r/Nanny an experience that I needed help on, which led me to have to explain the mom I was Nannying for had an OnlyFans lifestyle, yep, lifestyle - meaning it wasn't an under the rug type thing, it was really all she did. (The bigger issue was that she was actually taking advantage of me, gaslighting me, and only paying me $3 an hour so the OnlyFans was just a COMMENT I made) I was immediately attacked in the comments for ""judging her line of work."" because sex-work is real work, apparently.

I mean, I'm all for opinions and accepting human beings are sacred, important spirits of life but that doesn't mean I am going to admit to something I don't believe in. They tried silencing my opinion on the matter, I responded saying well, it's my opinion, OnlyFans is pure prostitution. 

I immediately got banned - Perma banned from r/Nanny literally forever. No insults, no arguing, just a few replies back and forth of me referring to OnlyFans that way. 

I wanted to see what you all had to say about this. As parents do you guys see OnlyFans as real work? Is that something you would judge somebody for in the same instance I did?"
Cealdi	2021-04-21 04:47:16+00:00	A small rave - our 4 year old made some good choices all on her own today!	"Our poor little one hasn't had much contact with other kids since the pandemic began (she had a life threatening immune reaction to another virus at 2 so we've been very cautious) so whenever she gets a chance to play with other kids, she's very excited. 

Earlier, she, her older sister, and I were at the mall and there is an outdoor dining area at this particular mall with games people can play (giant chessboard and pieces, cornhole, ping pong, etc.) and there were a couple of other masked kids her age playing so after she finished her dinner I told her to mask up and that she could join them for a bit. She was thrilled to get to run around with them and jumped right into whatever game they were playing, but pretty soon, one of them led the others to the chessboard and they all began violently kicking the chess pieces around. Some of them were breaking apart, and I watched LO to see what she'd do. Without even looking to us for direction or anything, she took a step back and crossed her arms and just stayed completely out of it. When they didn't stop after a few seconds, she ran back to join us and told us she didn't like that game because 'it's not nice'. I was so proud of her!! And then a minute or two later one of the other kids' parents broke it up and they were all back to playing again when two of them decided that flinging cornhole sandbags and random adults was a good idea. Again, LO refused to participate, even when they stuffed one into her hand and directed her to throw it at people. Instead, she just started trying to make it into the hole by herself. 

Sometimes you wonder if anything you're trying to teach your kid is sinking in, and it's just really nice to actually see that it is. Even her big sister, who is rarely impressed with much (it's the age...lol) was like, ""Wow, she's such a *good* girl. Look at that."" Lol"

He’s eaten some solids but only if they’re 90% baby food and he can swallow the piece without realising it’s even there. He doesn’t like any foods he liked in puréed form. No potatoes (and I mixed them with gravy, butter, and milk, to see if he’d like the combination of any of them with potatoes). We tried mashed carrots, and he loves the puréed carrots, and still nothing. I’ve offered peas, which he also liked, and no dice. We tried Mac n cheese with the pasta cut up all teeny and no, we tried pasta with tomato sauce and nothing. He likes bananas but doesn’t pick them up to chew it, he just lips it like one would an ice cream or an ice pop. They say you gotta keep offering and still nothing. He doesn’t like teethers or puffs or Cheerios. We plan to try avocado and honey nut Cheerios tomorrow but this is our last hope and we even made an appointment for a behavioural specialist l. He will chew on anything, even people, yet I can’t get him to chew on food. I’m at wits end. He can’t stay on baby food, but I also can’t starve him until he decides to eat real food. I’m at a loss for what to do. How does one teach their child to chew?! He’s got the moving food in his mouth down, but he tries to swallow everything whole, and when it don’t work he gags it up, mashes it in his mouth and does what I assume is chewing, then swallows but he gets so scared to take another bite and after about 3 he stops completely."

She has two older children with no concerns but not only does this 2 1/2 year-old have severe speech delay (he only says one word, doesn’t link 2 together and can’t pronounce any words correctly ie da for dog, ba for brother, mo for mum), for which she is getting speech therapy. He also can’t follow two-step instructions. Can’t even follow a one step instruction without extra support. He has a very short neck and a very large head. I work in healthcare and have friends work in healthcare and two of my friends within minutes of seeing my sister’s toddler turned to me and said what is wrong with her child? 
My sister saw a paediatrician once over a year ago about the large head and the paediatrician said just to monitor it. But as he becomes older it’s clear there are more concerned than just a language delay. My sister however is extra extra sensitive and while my mum is now very concerned as well (she looks after him 1 day a week) no one knows how to raise this with my sister. 

She has never had a child and family health check up with him (which is what we use in Australia to monitor growth and development) and is having her first one next month but I am concerned it might not be picked up in that 30 minute appointment?"
InstructionFlock	2021-04-21 03:07:54+00:00	Family night ideas?	"My nieces and nephews have come to stay with us indefinitely while their dad undergoes a tough series of medical treatments. (Mom thought it would be easier to support dad if the kids weren’t there also needing support. Dad didn’t want the kids seeing him so sick. Etc.) 

To help the kids feel a bit more at home and expedite the bonding process we’re instituting a family night where we all do something together. 

The kids are pretty different in age (14 and 8) so  we haven’t had many opportunities to really dig into something as the four of us. The teen always wants to go chat with friends and the younger one has hobbies that (understandably) don’t interest the teen.

We’re trying to think up some fun things the whole family can enjoy, but are finding it difficult with the age gap. 

So far what we’ve found successful is going to the pool at the Y, doing a make your own pizza night, and playing some board games. But thats about it, we’ve run out of ideas that both kids can get into. 

We’d love any help!"

I buy in bulk for our house, and smaller packs to send to school....different brands, different characters on said pull ups. 3yo was carrying around 3lbs of piss all damn day.

This is supposed to be one of the best daycares in town! I'm livid."
MrsB16	2021-04-21 02:43:38+00:00	Just found out I’m pregnant again &amp;we are considering terminating. No judgment please	"I just need somewhere to go because I have nowhere else. 

I have a beautiful almost 18 month old daughter. I just found out I’m pregnant tonight (I believe about 7-8 weeks). This was a huge shock because I had a period about a month ago but perhaps it was implantation bleeding. My husband and I both think that terminating the pregnancy is the best decision. He works out of town a lot, and it’s very hard on me already managing everything on my own. I don’t know how we would manage a baby and a toddler this close in age. My husbands job is very demanding and he wouldn’t be able to help me much. We also live in a 2 bedroom apartment. The guilt I fucking feel about terminating is already eating me alive. I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve been conditioned to feel this way, but also because I feel awful about not giving my daughter a sibling (we were planning 4 years apart). We can provide well financially and emotionally for our daughter but I don’t think we can right now for a second. I feel lucky to live in a progressive state where I have a choice. I’m sorry, no judgment...I just needed somewhere to vent."
delilahsunflower	2021-04-21 02:39:20+00:00	Question about WIC	"Hello, I’ve posted here before about my son crying nonstop for hours on end all day and night and the pediatrician figured out he’s lactose intolerant. I’ve been buying Enfamil soy and the crying immediately stopped after the first bottle but he’s spits it back up. Not a lot but enough to where he doesn’t seem to be doing good with it and I told his pediatrician that and she faxed over a prescription for it. Well my sons father went to go buy a few cans a couple days ago but all he could find was Similac Soy isomil. He’s been really good on the similac one and it’s in the wic website of what they cover so I was wondering if I can call Wic and see if they switch from the Enfamil soy to the similac soy since she sent a prescription for the Enfamil soy and he’s not liking it to much."
mysliceofthepie	2021-04-21 02:27:16+00:00	Looking for a night light that dims on a timer. Any recommendations?	"I have young girls who share a bedroom. At 7 o’clock they start “room time” where they have to go to their room, close the door, and enjoy quiet, screen-free activities until they want to go to bed. One of my girls has a harder time going to sleep, though, and she’ll keep the other one awake. I’ve noticed a (natural) correlation between the light being on or off changing just how soon they fall asleep. 

That said, I’m looking for a nightlight for them that can lighten up the room enough to read by, but that ever so slowly dims away into a tiny ember or just nothingness according to a timer I can set. I think if I had a way to slowly take the light away like that, where they barely notice it getting darker and darker, I would see an increase in earlier bedtimes. 

Thanks in advance!"

awesomejdo	2021-04-21 01:49:09+00:00	Do you believe parents have the right to hit their adult children? (Serious)	"I have a healthy relationship with both of my parents. My siblings and I were all hit as children (I personally don't see a problem with that). Anyway, when I was 21, my mom and I got into an argument, and she lost her cool and started hitting me. This was the only time in my adult life I had been struck by either one of my parents. When went to hit me again, I caught her hand (it was a reflex) and said something along the lines of ""I am an adult, you do not get to hit me"", and walked away. That was almost 3 years ago, and my mom and I never talked about that night. It came to my attention recently that my mom was furious at me for that night. She claimed that I ""raised my hand against her"" by blocking her hits, and told my father that she never thought she would feel the need to DEFEND herself from what of her children. To top it all off, my brother was chewing me out saying that I should have just taken the hits ""like a man"", and gave me a lecture that basically amounted to ""she was wrong to hit you, but you were more wrong for not taking it, and since she's my mom, I have to deal with it"". What do y'all think?  Any and all answers will be appreciated."

But we’ve been vaccinated and our family has as well. We’ll still take precautions and make sure everyone had access to hand sanitizer, disposable cups/plates, etc. 

Ok, so I didn’t throw a big party when my son turned one last year because of the pandemic. His second birthday is this summer. I haven’t hosted a kids birthday party before. First, what if I set a date with everyone and then the week of the party the weather forecast predicts bad weather? Do you cancel and reschedule? Do you go through with it anyway? I have a modular home and have a hard time imagining no one being able to go outside because we’d be crammed like sardines if it rains. But maybe rain (not storms) aren’t a big deal to guests? IDK. Tell me what you think. How soon do I invite people and set this up? Also, does a taco bar sound good? Does pizza sound better? We don’t have a grill so that’s not an option. Cake or cupcakes? Vanilla ice cream or Neapolitan? Both my family and my in laws buy Neapolitan but me and my husband hate it. Is just vanilla ok? Any tips or advice? Sorry if they seems like a giant ramble. I really don’t know what I’m doing. TIA."
kayshea1689	2021-04-21 01:34:04+00:00	My kid is being bullied?	"Last Friday when I picked my 3 year old up from school he told me his leg was hurting but he wouldn’t elaborate. Later when he was headed to soccer he has a total meltdown. He was hysterical the whole time telling me how this boy from his school pushed him down. This same boy is in his class and on his team. The teacher did not notify me of this. 
Today when I picked my son up from school she said they were playing ( my son and this boy) and my son was growling at him while they were playing monsters. The little boy told him to stop and my son kept growling. So the little boy pushed and kicked him. They were separated and made to listen to books about not hitting. 
The teacher told me the first time we talked she wasn’t there but this boy likes to play”big and loud” and it was probably accidental. But today she made it seem like my son provoked him, but regardless hitting and kicking isn’t ok. So which is it? He likes to play big and loud or he’s an aggressive kid. 🤔
I told my son to listen when people say stop and to find another friend to play with. I also explained it’s never ok to be hit or to hit. 

 Do you think this younger kid is a bully? This happened 2 times in three days. My son has a sizable laceration on his ankle. 
Is this developmentally appropriate? Is there anything else I should do? Is the school handling this well?"

Our routine is 2 books and some snuggle time. This takes about 15-20 minutes. My goal is to leave before she falls asleep so that she is not dependent on one of us laying with her in order to sleep.  But...

I lay with her for 5-10 minutes before I start to get up. Then she starts screaming, kicking, hitting, throwing things, causing damage, etc.  The only way I can leave is if she's asleep...and I ain't havin' that.  She makes me feel like a hostage in her room.

We have tried:

The physically put them back each time while calmly saying ""it's your bedtime, you need to stay in bed"" method,

The lay there as long as you need to (sometimes up to an hour),

Bribes,

Taking things away,

Spanking,


This is all happening with our 10 month old son trying to sleep in the next room.  We can't get a word in; she doesn't stop saying ""no"" or some other phrase even enough to hear what we have to say.  We are literally at a loss and we dread 8pm every day. In my opinion we've tried everything. I may have missed something we've tried so if anyone has ANY ideas, please, for the love of God, let me know.

Thank you."

This is our first child so we are defiantly experiencing/learning a lot. Today we got into a huge fight and she told me she does not trust me alone with the baby anymore. For the past 7 weeks my wife has been In school and I have been taking care of the baby from 730am-5pm. Never had a issue and as time went on I got better and better at being a father. I’m super grateful for the time I get to spend with my baby boy. Today when my wife came home everything was all good but I was a little tired and took a nap with the baby. My wife goes to Zumba on Tuesdays. Today bc I napped I didn’t get to take the dog on his afternoon walk when she gets home. When I woke up from my nap the baby was still sleeping and my wife has left for Zumba. The dog started whining that he had to go out since he hasn’t used the bathroom in 12 hours. So I put our sleeping baby in his empty crib and was planning on stepping outside with the dog just so he can pee and run back inside. He has a fully breathable mattress, the crib is empty and I had the baby monitor on him so I can watch when as I stepped out for 2 minutes. I then called my wife to ask where did she put the leash and when she found out what I was about to do she exploded on me. She was telling me how irresponsible I am, and how I’m making a massive mistake. Wtf is wrong with me for even consider doing something so reckless like that. So I began to tell her what am I suppose to do? He’s fully safe and I’m watching him. I then told her there is no difference if I had to use the bathroom or wanted to shower with him sleeping. His stroller is in her car so she made me put him in his car seat and I went out and carried him with me while I let the dog use the bathroom. She then begin to tell me that she doesn’t trust me with the baby alone anymore after trying to do something that crazy. And then she recommended that when she’s not home that my mother should come and help watch our baby until she gets home. This is when we get into a massive fight bc I feel extremely disrespected. I have been watching our alone for over 7 weeks, I do it all. Feed him change him play with him give him baths and she is now telling me that I need a supervisor to watch our child. After a bunch of back and forth I told her I do not want to fight anymore let’s just agree to disagree. She then said do I really see nothing wrong with what I did and I said no. I did tell her I will not do that ever again bc it worries her but I think she is way over exaggerating. For all the parents out there is this really that dangerous and reckless to do? I would never ever want to put my baby in any kind of danger but I don’t think it’s that insane with what o wanted to do. I was in and out of the house in 5 minutes or less. Any advice would be greatly appreciated"

mobmuS-buwmex7-	2021-04-21 00:37:12+00:00	Wife said she hates our (maybe) Autistic son	"My son(almost 3) is about to begin the diagnostic process for Autism and my wife is losing it fast. He seemed like a relatively normal developing child with a few quirks here and there, but a recent visit to the pediatrician has caused a massive change in my wife’s approach to him. She is constantly researching Autism topics, attempting to confirm his diagnosis herself, constantly crying, and talking about every negative that could ever possibly be (he will never have friends, go to prom, go fishing, play sports, he will never be potty trained, tell us if he is sick, we will have to care for him until we die, etc). The list goes on and on. I just don’t know how much more I can handle. She refuses to talk to anyone about it. Says it will not do any bit of good. 

The worst is nap or bedtime. He is not fussy but will just lay in his crib for hours wide awake in a pitch black room. She just stares at the monitor and gets so angry. Constantly yelling at him to leave his blanket alone, close his eyes, take your feet off the bars, etc. it has to be causing him more anxiety than anything. We have tried melatonin and it seems like it makes him more hyped. He will eventually fall asleep (at night) but will often wake up from midnight to around 4 am. She can hear him in the monitor and will just start crying in the middle of the night. I am a heavy sleeper and she will often wake me just to complain or stress over it. I do understand because if he doesn’t sleep, his behavior the next day is subpar at best. I do have to work though, so I often get upset with her as well, because there is nothing she or I can really do about it. He is safe in his crib but just awake. I tell her to turn off the monitor but she refuses to do so. She said she needs to know what he is doing, so she can tell the doctors. 

Any meal time is an adventure because he has some sensory issues. Refuses to use a fork or spoon. Often gags on certain textures and will vomit. Easily distracted by most anything. Most meals take 45 min minimum. She constantly yells at him to eat. Complains that she can’t make him anything, and gets pissed at me when I tell her to calm down.

She is always criticizing me for how I am with him. Says I am not consistent and that he acts different with me. I’ll be honest, I do parent differently than her but I try to be consistent with him. Especially at bedtime. However I may not put his shirt and pants on in the same order she does or I may not discipline him the way she feels is appropriate, but he always eats around the same time, gets put down for a nap at the same time, and has the same bedtime routine at the same time.

She has said that she would be better off dead, that it would be easier if he was completely handicapped, and that this is the worst case scenario. I have told her if she doesn’t want this for her life, she can leave. I am not holding her hostage. But that just pisses her off more. I don’t want her to, nor do I want to leave but I really don’t know how much more I can take. I can’t stand all of the negativity, the yelling, the complaining. I want to be able to help her but she refuses anything I try to offer. She thinks I don’t care because I don’t have the same level of anxiety she does, but that is simply not true. I just manage it very differently.

Our marriage is not healthy and probably wasn’t before he was born. However none of this is his fault, and I feel like hates him more and more each day. Apologies for the vent session, I just really don’t know what to do or how to handle all of this."

I looked up the basics and she had a very mild case and is to the rash part which indicates she is nearing the end of it all. Both my husband and I already had fifth's as a kid, so we aren't worried about catching it.

But, we both work fulltime. I was able to get remote tomorrow and looking online, it seemed to suggest that once the rash starts they aren't contagious, but how long would you wait to send your kid back to daycare?"
hangryhangryhipp0	2021-04-21 00:31:21+00:00	Angry child after surgery	"I had a major surgery a week ago and have activity restrictions for six weeks. I cannot lift, push, pull, etc. 

I prepared my 4 year old on an age appropriate level before this happened, and thought it would go pretty smoothly. He goes to school during the day time, and his dad is helping do all the things I normally do (morning routine, most of bedtime routine) while I heal. 

However, my child is...struggling. He seems to be angry. He tells me he hates me, says he wants to get rid of me, wants me pushed down the stairs. 

He is still very sweet sometimes, and tells me he loves me, will read with me. But he just goes off the chain. Today he wanted to watch tv after school. We agreed that he could watch one 5 minute show but that is all because then it will be dinner time. He agreed, but after he got upset we couldn’t watch another. That is normal,  but then he started hitting and kicking at me. At bedtime, he got mad that we wouldn’t let him jump off his bed and started trying to intentionally jump at me and try to push me over. 

Normally if he gets upset, I can talk to him and validate his feelings and redirect him, but those things aren’t working right now. Typically if he’s hitting I’m able to tell him I can’t let him hit and will hold him in my lap and hold his hands while I talk to him and help him calm down, but I can’t right now with my surgical wounds so fresh. 

I’ve tried to give extra praise for anything kind and helpful he’s doing or saying. I’ve even tried getting some toys from the store and if he can make it a full day with good listening and being kind and respectful. I’m completely at a loss. 

Please, any advice or suggestions will be helpful. Thank you!"

Am I over reacting to think that's kind of odd or worried my kids are going to go around saying grandma gave me pills? My husband dosn't want them back over there after this but, 1.

KeyOfGSharp	2021-04-21 00:01:41+00:00	My son (3yrs) won't stop pushing his sister (1yr).	"First and foremost, we are against hitting kids.

Now, sometimes my son will share things with his sister, and say 'here you go!' and so we shower him with praises. We really drive home the fact that what he did was good.

But sometimes, he'll see his sister and then I can see a devilish look in his eye. Now, I can a lot of the time beat him to it and tell him not to do it before he does, and he does listen.

But it's when I'm too late where things get dramatic.

If his hands are even on her it's too late. No matter how soft, or loud I try to be to either get his attention or divert him he just follows through. Then I get angry, she starts crying, and I try to explain to him that he hurt her.

I'll put him in his room and explain to him what he did and why it was wrong and then shut the door. (This definitely upsets him)

After a few minutes, I open the door (sometimes he's still upset but sometimes not) and I REITERATE what and why he did wrong. I hug him and make him apologize to his sister.

All seems pretty textbook right? I swear I'm not half-assing any advice given. But nothing quite seems to work.

Any ideas?"

Mephistophrina	2021-04-20 23:45:37+00:00	Preschool help	"My daughter (4yo) started preschool three months ago and adjusted really well. She would run off as soon as she got there to play with her friends and we never had a problem. My six year old just got accepted into a school we’ve been on a waiting list for and they run a preschool program. I decided to move my daughter to that preschool so I can drop them off together and then she will be already enrolled for kindergarten next year. Also her old preschool is too far away from my sons new school to manage drop offs and pick ups at different schools.

Well today was her third day at the new preschool and the drop offs have gotten progressively worse to the point I would say today felt traumatic. I don’t know how either of us is supposed to be able to go through with this every time. She was screaming before we even got out of the car, cried the whole way walking through the school to drop off her brother, and then once we got to her class she was screaming the most guttural scream I have ever heard come from her and just kept saying “I’m scared I’m scared” over and over clinging to me. The teacher gave us a minute for me to try to calm her but as soon as I was about to leave she started again. The teacher had to physically pull her off me and restrain her so I could get out the gate and then I saw my daughter thrash on to the ground and continued screaming until I walked far enough away I couldn’t hear her anymore.

I have no idea if this is normal because we never had this happen at the old school. How long should I expect this to last? Is this traumatic to continue doing to her? I’ve honestly never seen her in that state before. I have no idea what to do. It is so much harder because my son loves his new school and it was a lot of work to get him accepted and having them go to separate schools will be too difficult.

Please help!"

"So, our newborn (born a late premie at 36 weeks) who is currently 3 weeks old, does not like being swaddled. We often find her struggling within her swaddle, trying to pry her arms out (I believe a lot of babies like to have their arms by their face, or even use them to soothe themselves, when sleeping. She often succeeds in prying her arms out, or possibly spends a lot of energy trying. 

Our primary intention for swaddling her is - (a) to keep her warm, and (b) a check against the moro reflex.

Are there any non-swaddle solutions that fit both the above requirements?"
Odd-Bodybuilder-1854	2021-04-20 23:22:14+00:00	In Desperate Need of Sanity Check - Is my coparent toxic toward the kids?	" 

Hello Reddit Community,

I am crying for help. The issue that I have is that we fundamentally disagree on how we parent the children and I'm afraid that it is straining our relationship. I am asking for comments, advice, and perhaps even relatable stories so that I don't feel so alone.

We have three young children, all under the age of 11 that are approximately 3 years apart each. Two are in ""Zoom School"" right now due to COVID, and for the past 8 years, I have been the sole breadwinner in the house. My job is very demanding and we do not have any secondary sources of income. Since the pandemic started in March 2020, I have been working remotely, and I will soon return to the office. During the past year, I have seen a lot that has had me carefully question my observtions, and sometimes my sanity. No matter how I bring up my concerns about my observations of her parenting, it always turns into a weird moment where she gets defensive and if I decide to stick to my guns and request a serious conversation about my concerns, she will raise her voice until we either fight about it, or I (or she) walks or drives off to avoid another argument.

These are the top issues that I have brought up that I consider very toxic and feel need to change. Reddit, please be my sanity check. Should I be seriously concerned or am I being too sensitive?

1. **YELLING** during Zoom and during homework/schoolwork - Kids are difficult, right? They disobey, they whine and procrastinate, and they sometimes choose noncompliance as a solution to tough moments. My kids are good kids, but they are KIDS. The ones in school have good days and bad days, but all in all, they are really good kids. They are compassionate, they make friends easily, and they love their school. But she yells at them at least once a day while they are doing their schoolwork during any of the above resistance points I described below. I know that her yelling can be abusive because at times she will curse at them and ridicule them if they try and talk back.
2. **Spontaneous punishments -** If one of the kids misses a homework assignment, or gets caught violating a tablet or ""screen time"" curfew, she has historically been inconsistent in matching the punishment to the crime. Sometimes she will not punish for a violation that historically had an extreme punishment - In other words, there's little consistency here. Sometimes, she will dish out an extreme punishment and then tell me about it afterward, instead of allowing us to put our heads together and discuss. Once she barged into my home office while I was on a conference call for work, and as soon as I motioned that ""I was on a call, but it's on mute"" she took it upon herself to vent about what she caught the kid doing (texting over Facebook kids with a family member when she should have been paying attention to zoom class) and that ""she was grounded from chatting and playing video games for three months"" - I told her that now wasn't a good time, and if there's any chance we can discuss before such a harsh punishment is made. While I was on my call (still muted) she made a comment that I am not around so she has to do the parenting... - Um, hello, *I* was working to support the family while you were doing *your* job. This point in particular often gets lost on her in these emotional fits she has. Sometimes I think she takes me for granted, but that's another convo.
3. **Low Boundaries -** when she is not providing oversight to the kids' responsibilities like school and everything is fair weather she often makes, encourages, and laughs at bathroom humor with the kids. Trust me, as a guy who laughs harder at a good fart joke than any type of highbrow humor, I can relate to how funny it is and how it's a great way to win the affection of kids, HOWEVER, as a Dad I cringe because when she does this, I believe that she undermines her authority- so it comes off as very confusing and very Jekyll and Hyde when just two hours before she was yelling at the kids because they were stuck on a math problem and wanting to give up. In addition to undermining her authority, she is also, in my opinion, compromising respect and trust by yelling at the kids all the time.
4. **Complaining about the kids to me when they can hear it -** This is the one that probably triggers me the most because I think it's hurtful to the kids and very disrespectful to me. The most common scene that this happens is when I come into the house for lunch break during a work day or come home for the day. Before even asking me how my day went (which she rarely asks anyways) she will start dumping on me about how ""bad"" the kids were or how ""difficult"" the kids/specific kid was during the day, going into detail that is in my opinion, very hurtful. For example, this is something she would say without constraint on any given day... *""This afternoon, (kid name) was on her stupid video game again when she should have been submitting work. And now she is fucking up her science grade because her test score came in low. If she wasn't always fucking around and doing dumb shit, this wouldn't be so hard""* \- all the while, the kids are literally in the next room and can all hear it. This has to be terrible for a kid's self esteem. It infuriates me and I tell her that it's harmful and abusive to talk like that in front of the kids and she will just get defensive and sometimes turn on me as if I am not trying to consider being a parent. The ironic part is that as a parent, I want to protect the kids this type of behavior which I consider to be highly abusive.
5. Lovebombing at the end of a rough day - after one of these rough days, which average at least 3-4 per week, she hardly apologizes to the kids *but* definitely goes full send on putting on the affection with all of the cuddles, late bedtime cuddle and story/song routines, and sometimes even a last minute decision to ""get takeout because I didn't prepare anything for dinner,"" when in actuality, the afternoon was chaotic, mismanaged, and full of toxic emotion that stood in the way of being productive...(Btw, I'm not trying to assign a gender role of making dinner here, but if I don't get off of work until right before dinner time and she doesn't have a 8-6 job, then, dinner is hers to plan unless she asks for my help well in advance. Period.)

Ok - I am trying to be disciplined enough to keep the list short, so I'll end there. If anyone is even reading this, you may be wondering ""how does she treat you, bro?"" I'll say this, we have had our issues and we have grown a lot over nearly 15 years of marriage. I am trying to figure out how to effectively break through on the above issues. If anyone has experience, advice, or has a simlar situation and finds this relatable, please join the conversation.

Sincerely,

direvus	2021-04-20 23:14:03+00:00	Getting rejected by my kids	"I'm a dad with a toddler coming up on 3 years, and a baby at 8 months.  Right now the baby is going through that ""only mummy"" phase and it sucks.

When she starts screaming in the night (happens 3-10 times a night), and I go in to try to calm her down, her reaction is a full-body furious rejection.  She arches her back and pushes me away with her arms all while screaming like somebody is trying to murder her.  This goes on until my wife shows up, and then she is fine all of a sudden.

It is just the worst.  It kills me right in the feelings.  I feel unloved.  I feel like a failure.  I feel worthless.

My older kid (now a 3 year old) did this same thing for a while at a similar age, and it sucked then too.  I have a pretty good relationship with her now, but in the last few weeks she has regressed and now sometimes she will yell at me ""No Daddy I don't want you I need my mummy!"" and it's like a knife in the guts every time.

Some days I'm getting it from both of them at the same time, so the house is full of screaming and crying, my wife is overloaded and I can't do anything to help.  Those are my least favourite days.

I know that this is a normal phase for kids to go through, and my wife knows that this isn't my fault, but she can't really fully empathise, because she has no idea what this feels like.  I hope she never finds out.  Because it sure does suck absolute balls.

I don't have anything productive to say about this, just wanted to have a rant.  If you made it this far, thanks for listening."

amha29	2021-04-20 22:36:13+00:00	My kid isn’t eating enough at school.	"Kid went to school on site starting February. I didn’t realize this sooner that him not eating enough at school means he’s not eating enough daily. 

We feed kid at the same time every single day, so it’s not like he’s starving or malnourished. But this might start affecting him because I didn’t realize this sooner.

He eats breakfast at home, then lunch at school and then he eats again right after school. Sometimes I pack him a lunch so I can see how much he eats at school.... he barely eats. 

Today I packed half a cheeseburger dog which is ground beef mixed with cheese shaped into a hot dog, and put into half a hot dog bun. Half a cup of grapes, half a cup of fries, 4 oz of apple sauce and 2 small cookies. Along with his drink.

He ate half of the grapes, half of the fries, a bit of apple sauce and half of his drink... that’s it. When he got home he said he was hungry, of course he barely ate anything at all! 

This is happening every single day. It’s not that he didn’t like the food, he just doesn’t eat. He ate pretty much the same thing after he took a shower. Which should be his 3rd daily meal but he didn’t really eat anything for his second meal.  Now he needs to eat again to get enough nutrients for the day, and he has 3-4 hours after school before he has to go to bed. I didn’t realize before that him not eating enough at school means he’s not eating enough daily."
tanjirhoe	2021-04-20 21:10:36+00:00	"I’m pregnant at 20 with my 22 year old boyfriend, is keeping it naive?"	"
To preface, my boyfriend and I have worked with and known each other for 2 years. We officially started dating 1 month ago, he’s met my family and I am meeting his dad this weekend. 

I just found out i was pregnant last week and he immediately wanted to keep it since the one thing in life that he’s wanted is to have a family. So much so that he promises to marry me should we keep it and would gladly work full time to support our family. He came from a single father household (his father was 17) and has worked with kids so he knows this is what he wants and the responsibility it comes with. He graduates this year with a psychology degree.

I’m 20, pursuing a double major at the same university, could graduate by this fall, and plan to go to law school after taking a gap year to study for the LSAT. It was originally never part of my plan to be pregnant although the idea of having a child makes me happy (i truly think i would not regret having one this soon as soon as i look at it). I have 25k in investments to fall back on while having a decently paying job (16.50/hr and 20hrs each week). I would eventually have my families support (no financially but they may offer to help with babysitting and offering knowledge) once they adjust. I currently pay for all of my own bills and he does as well.

I’m wondering if I’m crazy for even considering this. After all, we’ve been only dating for 1 month (have been living together the entire time) and we are both so young that i worry we will regret missing out on our twenties (I won’t even be able to drink on my 21st birthday). We would be relying on increased financial aid due to having a dependent, getting married, and no longer using our parents FAFSA. He also received settlement money (50k when he’s 25 and 50k when he’s 30). We would also have health insurance through my university. 

Am i being naive for wanting to keep it? What am i not considering?

TDLR: Me and my boyfriend are pregnant and without a long relationship history, i’m worried we are being too naive in wanting to keep it."

When I ask her why she is snapping at me, she says I make her mad because I'm always telling her to do something. Yes, she has chores, very basic chores that I've assigned her, which is cleaning the table, which is very small, sweeping the dining area, and clean/vacuum her room. She forgets to clean when she is supposed to so I have to tell her, that's why to her, it always sounds like I'm telling her to do something. She literally rolls her eyes, every single time. Instead of just saying ""ok mom"", it's ""I know, I was gonna do that right now"" or ""I know what to do"" or ""you dont have to tell me again"". But I'm repeating myself every single day to her about what she is supposed to do. 

She doesn't care about getting things taken away like her cell phone, YouTube privileges, extra chores, etc. We'll put her on punishment and afterwards its back to the same behavior. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do anymore. I'm thinking of taking us to therapy to maybe see if there's something else bothering her. Is this normal 9 year old behavior or what??"
loulabonte	2021-04-20 20:28:34+00:00	Can I make my almost two-year-old quit the sippy cup cold turkey?	"My kid will turn two in a couple of weeks and has an expressive language delay. One of the things our speech therapist recommended was to get him off of the soft-spouted sippy cup and to use a straw or open cup instead.

Kid is strong-willed and not inclined to try new cups he doesn’t know how to maneuver. We have tried multiple straw cups including the honey bear - he doesn’t seem to understand that he has to close his lips and suck on a straw. Just kind of bites on it instead. So then we revert to the sippy.

Would it be cruel/wrong of me to take a cold turkey approach and just refuse to get out the sippy cups, and instead just offer him a straw or open cup? Would he figure it out or get super dehydrated? Help! Thanks!"

Today a 6 month old cried a lot in stroller during outdoor and slept off ! But as that is not allowed she picked the kid while he was sleepy and forced him to sit on playground !! Another kid who needs extra help with food and is picky is neglected too . He is given only bread as she says he has only that but last days I tried soup with him and he ate with no problem ! She yelled at me for doing that and threw soup in bin and I am shocked .. i might not be highly experienced teacher but as a mother ( myself )I couldn’t believe this .

Illustrious_Egg_12	2021-04-20 19:58:29+00:00	My toddler is violent?! Is this normal?	"So my toddler (barely 1) loves to sweep, swiffer, or use his toy lawn mower. Pushes it all through the house, has a blast. But if it touches anything (the edge of the carpet, the pillars, table, wall, etc.) He starts SCREAMING and falls to the floor.

If I try to rock him to sleep, he claws at my face, slaps me, yanks my hair, etc.

If someone is playing with his toy he tries to hit them with it or he takes it and throws it at the floor.

When he tries to wake me up in the morning he comes running to my room and starts slapping me in the face.

If I tell him not to dig in the trash he kicks me, does this weird screech noise and starts digging harder...

He can't be around his cousins (who are also barely one, but none of which are walking or anywhere near his size. He's a big boy at 32 inches tall and 35 lbs) because he likes to step on them or push them over and laugh!

I don't know what to do! Are all toddler boys like this or is mine broken? A lot or my family and my husband's family said it's pretty normal for boys to be violent but i don't know if that's true"

I have read about tons of cases of turner syndrome in girls, but contrary to popular belief, turners does NOT only affects females. It also affects men (apparently male at birth with penis and testes). It's called mosaic turner syndrome with 45X,46XY karyotype. 

My unborn in-utero baby might be suffering from this and I want to ask what are the symptoms and how do they present? 
Were the symptoms manageable or very severe?
Does the boy feel intrinsically a male? 
Does the facial appearance look normal male or is it similar to turner symptoms of females (thick neck, droopy eyelids, short stature)?

It used to be for staying in her bedroom all night and it was quit hard for her to earn a sticker, then it was days with 0 tantrums, then when that phase ended we adapted it for doing basic chores.  The problem is that she is at school all week plus her little brother likes to help and there is basically no challenge in earning a sticker, or too hard because we haven't given her enough to do or there is no time.  Basically it's now hard to be consistent and fair. This used to be how she earned new toys but because of covid she has become too fixated on prizes so we want to ease off and maybe  make the reward chart for books and art supplies only.

So I am really asking two questions. 1) What kind of reward chart system do you use for a 5 year old and 3) How often do your kids get new toys?  Do they earn them or just get them randomly?"

He has been to inpatient treatment for suicidal thoughts and statements, he's seeing a therapist, got kicked out of his after school program for being constantly disruptive.... It's been very stressful, especially since he's never been a troublemaker before.  
    
I got a call from the school that he bear hugged a classmate, making her feel uncomfortable because his hands incidentally landed near her chest, and when she said so, he said it wasn't on purpose, then poked another girl's chest to demonstrate what on purpose would look like. And he followed that up the next day by putting his foot on a girl's crotch while she was sitting on the ground.  
    
I'm of a mindset at this point that I wish I could afford military school. He's going to ruin his life, and the constant stress of waiting for the next phone call telling me how he's screwing up is pretty rough.  
    
I'm going to have him write apology letters to the girls. I swear, if there were a big kid in the neighborhood I could pay to rough him up, I would consider it. People don't mess around with guys mistreating girls, and the sooner he learns it the better. Any sane suggestions are welcome."
owlaround	2021-04-20 19:14:40+00:00	By what age/size/milestone is a kid no longer in credible danger of falling into a toilet?	"Our home toilet is equipped with a drop-down toddler toilet seat (like [this one](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LTyKlFo4L._AC_SL1500_.jpg)) and a small stepstool. Our toddler is about to turn 3 and is capable of doing most toilet actions completely by himself, reliably: opening the toilet lid, dropping the toddler seat into place, pulling down his pants and underpants, climbing into position, peeing/pooping, climbing back down, pulling his underpants and pants back up, flushing the toilet, and re-closing the lid. The only things he can't do by himself yet is wipe his butt or wash his hands. We're about to transition him to a ""big boy bed;"" he's never tried/had the inclination to climb out of his crib, so this will be his first time with the freedom to roam once he wakes up. I am of the opinion that part of his new morning autonomy includes the ability to go pee in the toilet if he wants to (he never poops before breakfast), which has the added benefit of easing the transition out of overnight diapers when the time comes. My husband is worried the toilet is still a hazard and wants to lock it shut. How credible is the toilet-drowning hazard at this age and level of capability?"

She's very competitive when it comes to everything, even when it comes to whose daughter is the prettiest. Her best friend has a blonde little girl and she told me that ""there's no way she's gonna let that girl look prettier and blonder than her daughter."" What the heck? She's taking her to dance classes and she says that blonde dancers stand out than brunettes and this is what it's gonna take to ""make her daughter a star.""

Dingus_Guide	2021-04-20 19:13:39+00:00	What do you do when your bigger-little kids just decide not to listen?	"tldr: 8 year old feeds a strangers dog that I told her not to go near, is unphased by consequences, this is just one example of a trending pattern these days.  


I’ll outline this scenario that now has my big one (8) chilling in time out for one hour. But overt disobedience is becoming a thing for her and the time out isn’t cutting it. I can tell on her face it’s like “yawn, eye roll, whatever mom. I’ve got 87 books and 250 stuffed cats to pass my time in my room, try me.” I need more creative consequences to hit the message home when pure reason just doesn’t do the job.

Less than an hour ago I had her and her two year old sister at the playground enjoying the perfect weather. Cue some lady showing up with her kids and a very large dog. My daughter followed my stranger dog rules and asked the owner if she could pet it before she tried, good!

The lady says ok but I notice the dog is eating or chewing a toy. I see my daughter reach out and the dog immediately backs away. This says to me, stop, danger. I call her over to me and say “even if that lady says it is ok, that dog is eating and backed away. That says no, I don’t want to be touched. Don’t go near the dog again, okay? And just as a rule, never touch a dog who is eating. Even nice dogs can get mean when they’re eating and you don’t want to get bit.”

My kid immediately, and I meant LITERALLY IMMEDIATELY turns away from me and heads right back to the dog and is now hovering about an arms length away. The lady, not having heard my talk with my daughter, asks her if she wants to feed it a treat. My daughter happily agrees and she gives the dog a treat. I call her back over and tell her we are leaving right now, she broke my rule and she will be having a timeout. She tries to say the lady offered and I cut her off, saying I said don’t even go back near them and you know I wouldn’t have wanted you to do that. She doesn’t make the rules for you, I do.

Aside of shooting me a dirty look, I can see none of this hit home and on the walk home she even asks if she can play in her room during the time out. This was not effective. What would you do to hammer home things like this? I don’t hit, I don’t yell. But she definitely behaves like my limits are optional and in a case like this it scares me, bc some stupid lady who brings a food defensive dog on the playground should not be who she is basing her choices on and if she got bit all the sorrys in the world wouldn’t help.

I was raised by wolves (pun unintended) so I need some help navigating this new, screw you mom, I do what I want, kind of phase."
MorgueMaus	2021-04-20 19:06:56+00:00	My four year old will. Not. Listen.	"I feel so lost.


My four year old (almost five) daughter has been so good, so attentive, polite, and followed directions for so long. As of recently, that has taken a nosedive.


It seems like if I give her even the tiniest request - don't bother the cat, don't destroy this, stop getting into this - she immediately does the opposite. It's like she physically cannot resist doing what I tell her not to. She stole scissors out of the back of one of our kitchen drawers and cut our cat's hair and some of her whiskers, then cut part of her own hair and hid the scissors, which are now being stored in the top of our cabinets. She's taken food out of our pantry, nibbled on it, then takes the leftovers and hides them. I asked her the other day to bring her bowl from lunch - literally a 10 foot walk - from her seat to the counter, and instead she hid it in the cabinet below the counter.


Just as an experiment, I had her sit on the couch next to a cat toy, and told her to not bother the toy for literally 60 seconds. I stepped behind the couch, out of view, but she knew I was there. Within about 20 seconds, she was playing with the toy.


We recently moved, and I ended up staying at home instead of working. We have been here for almost three months now, and this has just started up. I have tried reward charts, taking away privileges (ie cartoons during lunch, extra toys we had bought her), timeouts, and nothing is working.


Literally any advice is welcome. I'm feeling so stuck and I don't know what to do or how to help her."
beckitup	2021-04-20 19:00:41+00:00	Nap time story	"Our two year old recently has been fighting his afternoon nap and bedtime for that matter.  We always have our routine b4 nap- nap time reminder, snack, , quiet play, diaper change, 3-4 books in bed, lights out, and we will sit or lay with him until he falls asleep.  Once we were in his bed it usually took around 15 min and he would be out, but now it has been taking 45+ min of him rolling around restless, WWE style 😅🤕 

Today for his nap I randomly thought to tell him a story after we turned his lights off.  Now I am not good at making up stories on the fly so I just did my best at telling the story of Petter Pan, I spoke softly and didn't get too loud or excited.  

Right when I started, he layed down next to me and held my hand while I was telling the story and was quiet and listening!  About 3-5 min in to telling the story (Wendy and brothers first trying to fly in the nursery) he was getting really sleepy, so I spoke quietly until I stopped talking and told him goodnight and kissed his forehead and he drifted off to sleep.  What a win!  Why didn't I think to try this b4?!  Well, we will try it again tonight and see what happens.  This might help my story telling abilities too, win win! 😆"
PotatoMorridon	2021-04-20 18:56:45+00:00	"Pregnant and regretful, is it just nerves?"	"I've recently found out I'm pregnant (very early stages). All my life I've wanted children, its always been a point of tension at home because my partner didn't. More recently he has opened to the idea but was indifferent at best.

When friends have announced they're expecting I've always felt a pang of jealousy and sadness.

I thought a positive pregnancy test would be the best thing ever, but I feel anxious and terrified. I enjoy my freedom and income and sleep. Why would I want to change that?

I'm worried I've made a terrible mistake. I've suffered with depression and am convinced I'll get PND and I'm scared I won't bond with the baby. 

Has anyone felt this way and how did things work out for you?"
punknprncss	2021-04-20 18:55:39+00:00	Bed wetting 8 year old	"Help! Looking for advice on my bed wetting 8 year old boy. I do not believe this is a medical issue so please no comments regarding going to see a doctor. 

8 year old boy, second child, potty trained later (4 years old). Drinks primarily milk (water at school).

He can go 3-5 nights completely dry, then he will go 3-5 nights wetting the bed. I believe the problem is partly that he is a heavy sleeper, combined with being a night owl. I also believe he's a bit lazy and not overly motivated to care. 

He's past the age where sticker charts work, he's financially motivated though but apparently not enough to care that he's wetting the bed. 

He does not wake me up after he wets the bed, will get up and change himself, put a blanket down on the bed and go back to sleep. 

I've tried to limit letting him drink after a certain hour but haven't noticed a strong correlation between limiting drinks and wetting the bed. 

I work full time, out of the home, so getting home at 530 and then needing to do laundry is getting old. 

What other options may work? I'm half ready to just put him back into pull ups until he's 13. 

(Note: no real social issues at this point, he's never gone to a sleepover but I suspect in the next year, that will start coming into play)"
Tay_phay	2021-04-20 18:44:32+00:00	"80% ready to have a baby, 20% second guessing"	"My husband(27) and I(F23) have gotten the baby fever worse and worse over the past year and a half. We have great jobs, rent a home with no expectations of being forced out ever, and I think my husband would make a wonderful loving father. We joke about having a kid all the time, even bought a baby name book that we found at a thrift store a few months back. Sometimes we do get serious and really talk about how we want one. But then when it comes to the very moment to decide if we are going to try on purpose, we chicken out. We talk about all of the traveling we want to do, plans to buy a house, etc. (Which I know CAN be done with a child of course, but it must be different.) We haven't actively tried to have a baby, but also haven't NOT tried? Haha! My period has been late a few times and I will take a pregnancy test when that happens. Usually, I just feel fine with the negative test. But the past two times, a part of me felt disappointed with seeing it negative.   


How do you KNOW when you are ready? Will one ever truly be 100% ready? Am I putting the % symbol in the right spot?!"

I promised myself I’d not fight with my husband in front of them given that my own parents fought a lot and I know it wasn’t good for me. I don’t fight with my husband but when we’re exhausted or stressed, we snap at each other / make slightly petty comments to each other / my irritation comes through in what I say or how I say it. We don’t raise our voices but it still bothers me that we do this in front of the kids. We often say that we’ll keep trying to do better but it happens anyway.

How does this kind of thing affect the kids? Are we terrible?

We get along really well for the most part but inevitably take out our frustrations on each other since it’s really hard to even see friends or other people during this Covid period!"

AngryAll	2021-04-20 17:58:14+00:00	"I don't like the kids that ""wander"" our neighborhood"	"There are lots of children in our neighborhood, but one particular set of kids really just seem to wander the neighborhood all day.

My son first met them at the bus stop to school a few years ago, and they began knocking on our door at random times asking if my kids can play. I said yes in the beginning (when I didn't know them), as long as they stayed here, where I can monitor them. 

The more I watched them play here at my house, the less I liked them. I began pointing things out to my son, telling him ""a friend wouldn't to that"" or pointing out when they went straight for the computer or when they left him out and asking him ""are they here to play with *you* or our toys?"" He hesitated with his responses to these for a while because he's incredibly social and desperate for friends, but eventually he began to see for himself that they were not being nice and he told me he didn't like playing with them much (whew!). So he stopped saying yes and eventually they stopped coming over.

But this last year with COVID has been hardest on him because he wants/needs so much more social interaction than our other kids. In-person learning started again and they spoke on the bus, and now he wants to hang out with them again. I've let him come over and witnessed similar behavior to before, so I limit how often I say yes. I ask him ""are you sure you want to play with them?"", and he says yes, but I know my son is just desperate for someone to play with and will settle for anything. 

Now my son (10yo) has been asking to ride his bike around the block by himself, which I wouldn't mind if these kids didn't wander the neighborhood. I have a terrible feeling that these rides will result in him running into this group more often (every time we've taken a walk or gone to the park, one kid in particular shows up at some point). This kid has been a bad influence before, so even if my son leaves with good intentions of just riding around the block, I can picture him trying to talk my son into going somewhere with him and claiming ""she'll never know!""

But at the same time, I remember how much I loved riding my bike around the block as a kid. He wants to play outside and I hate the thought of depriving him of that."

I don't want to be judged when I take my child to the playground and she acts out times 10. I'm just so tired and am doing everything wrong. What can I do? I hate myself. I wish I would have waited to have her when I was older and more financially able to handle things. I have no help. So so tired."

I want to find a summer program for her or maybe just classes or really anything at this point to get her interacting with other kids her age and having more consistent educational experiences.

fc3sbob	2021-04-20 17:36:23+00:00	6 year old in online school is not going well for the second time.	"I am having a huge issue with my 6 year old in online school. Here in Canada we just went back to Online and this is the second time he's doing this with the first half of the second semester being in person.

In his last online class during his first semester he didn't know the teacher or students and would not participate, got angry, threw stuff, kicked, hit, left the room and would refuse to come back, scream for HOURS, ect. Probably the entire semester he did a day or two worth of class. The problem is, he's not like this at any other time. Not one other kid in the class was like this or had to have a parent sitting there. I'm a single dad half the week and had to hire someone to watch him so I could go back to work, She basically gave up after a month because she couldn't control him.

Now with this semester he knows all the students and teachers from in person classes that just ended and went online I was thinking this would work a bit better. We are half a day in and once again he's the only student not participating, turning off his camera, sitting on the floor/under his desk, walking out, more interested in when break time is, luckily no meltdowns or screaming yet. I don't understand how parents can work from home and do this. I have yet to see another adult on camera helping their kids or any other students acting like this, They seem to be perfectly following along. I'm not sure what to do. 

I've tried punishments (taking away electronics and toys), yelling, not yelling, reward systems. I can't get a grip on this and I don't know what to do.

He's about the same at his mom's house. I think she may be a bit more lax, at least with last semester, as in if he's not feeling it then he doesn't have to do it within reason, But we do work together on this as much as we can and she says she will be more strict with it this time around.

In person class, I haven't had a complaint and he seems to love it.

Any Advice?"
shelfoo	2021-04-20 17:23:16+00:00	Today my daughter accepted her first grown up job. The feels.	"My daughter is 22 years old, she finished up university last week with a Bachelors of Social Work, and today she accepted a job at a place related to her field. Full time. Salary. Benefits.

I cannot even begin to describe how happy I am for her. There's knowing that it's coming, and watching your children grow. But this, this feeling that's hitting me realizing that she's a completely independent adult. It's like nothing I've ever experienced. I think the grin on my face is as big as it was on the day she was born. 

I'm in awe of my daughter. She has worked so incredibly hard to get where she is. And the emotions are just bubbling out of me.

I don't really know why I'm posting. I guess first just because of how incredibly stoked I am for her. But also just to share with all of you parents out there. The struggles of raising a child are real. Lots of days where it feels so incredibly hard. But I'd easily do it all over again to experience this feeling."

OutrageousSea5212	2021-04-20 16:53:12+00:00	Baby keeps covering her head and holding her breath??	"My baby is 7 months old and, for the last month, has been pulling the closest piece of cloth (ie clothing, receiving blanket, clothy toy) over her face. She does this when she's on her back and will do it repeatedly if I let her. If there's no blanket close by, she'll improvise with small toys.

When her face is covered, she flails her arms and legs and appears to hold her breath, so obviously it freaks me out. She looks like she's struggling and suffocating. If I wait, most of the time she'll eventually whip the cloth free from her face, make eye contact with me, and then do it again. But sometimes it feels like it goes on too long and I race to throw the cloth away. 

I'm guessing this is an object permanence thing (she's effectively playing peekaboo with herself). 

Do I just let her keep experimenting so she gets bored with it eventually? Is this a phase anyone else has witnessed? It does NOT help my PPA."

Splashingcolor	2021-04-20 16:27:53+00:00	Sick of virtual band class (rant)	"Whoever at my child's school who decided it was a good idea to have virtual band class **at 7:30 AM** is a freaking asshole.

Every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday we are woken up by the sounds of our 13yo trying to play the **trumpet**. I'm a sahm and my SO works from home and doesn't start work until 9, somedays not till after 10. Apparently though, our child's school believes everyone is up and started with their day by 7:30 so a drum, trumpet, or French horn playing this early is no issue. 

You know who does think it's a serious issue? Our toddler. Three days a week my toddler's sleep is interrupted and he is not a happy camper. The kid (like us) likes his sleep and tends to sleep in until 9:30-10 normally.

I'm sure we will all be excited once this is over and band class happens at whatever time the school wants, far far away from our bedrooms."
ILivetoEat_	2021-04-20 16:12:17+00:00	Is leaving baby overnight once in a while irresponsible?	"Hi everyone, I’m a future teen mom here with an AMAZING support system. I have a lot of people I can talk to, but to be completely honest, I’m afraid of being called a monster for even thinking about this. 

Here’s my question, is it normal to leave baby overnight once in a while to go out and have fun? I’m kind of planning ahead, and thinking that once he can sit up maybe i should think about going out and getting a drink with friends. I’ve asked my friends, but their not parents so while they all say I won’t be bad mom I don’t feel right taking advice from other teenagers. 

Growing up and currently, my mom never went out because she always rejected her friends offers, even though we can all take care of ourselves now. She also doesn’t drink and has always been a stay at home mom with me. She’s been a wonderful mom, and it leaves me wondering if this is what takes.

Basically, would it be irresponsible of me to leave baby with mom (If she wants too, she also doesn’t work and I’m the last one in the house) overnight once in a while to go out and be a teenager?  Is it normal to even be thinking about this so early? I’m willing to sacrifice everything to give my son the best life possible, so please be honest! It’s been weighing on me lately, and I would really like some insight from older, wiser people."
TrixDriver	2021-04-20 16:07:48+00:00	Four year old refusing to be potty trained?	"My nephew is three (he will be four in October) and he screams hysterically when we try and put him in pants (pull ups or normal) and won’t sit on the potty. He screams “I want a nappy on” over and over again and freaks out. When we tell him he needs to learn, he refuses and says no. My brother tries to be strong willed with him and tells him he can’t wear a nappy forever. He’s not a child who cries a lot but for some reason not wearing a nappy freaks him out, he’s not even at the stage of hating the feeling of a dirty nappy. He’s one of the only children in his playgroup who is still in nappies, something the staff have brought up. He watches his older brother use the toilet but it doesn’t encourage him. Also worth noting that when he does wear pants, he covers up his legs with a cushion or something similar. Is this normal? Is there anything we can do? He only stays with us a few days a week so it’s hard for us to get him trained. He was also slow at crawling, walking, speaking etc so we’ve tried not to push him too hard. I know it’s difficult to teach a child to do something if they’re not ready but we would like him to learn."

I’m a single mom — son is 15 and spends about 50 percent of time with me.  The other with his dad. My son (with his dad) have 2 small Maltese dogs. One was from our marriage and the other — I gave to my son as a present so the dog could have a friend.

I on the other hand had a golden retriever — I was engaged to a man for 6 years and he got that dog as my birthday gift. ( i never wanted a large dog, but here we were!)

The dog was extremely difficult. My now EX fiancé — hated the dog and I finally paid over 1k for the dog to go to a training bootcamp.. and he came back improved.  

My son loved the dog. After we broke up, my fiancé left the dog with me. I took the dog to get fixed….(my ex never wanted that). In a tragic weird siatuion — he died during that procedure. He apparently had an eneglarged heart and he died. We were all upset of course.

I went and bought a Maltese puppy. I have had that dog for almost a year now. He was getting stir crazy at home and my son kept asking me to get him a friend. I said maybe…. 

I finally broke down on easter and bought another puppy. Registered …good dog. But my Maltese is very bad with him. He’s aggressive toward the puppy AND he has also regressed in his potty training…. He pees everywhere and pees on my new puppy’s belongings etc.

I am at my Witts end. I am just over it — and I know that sounds cold, but I feel like I am not a good dog parent or whatever. I run my own business from home and I’m constantly picking up urine (mostly from the OLDER dog). The puppy has been pretty good about using the puppy pads! 

I am really considering re-homing both dogs at this point. But, I feel horrible even suggesting that… and I am worried about my son’s eactions because he loves them too. 

Any advice? I am losing my mind and my home has turned into a doggie urinal …."

MixedMartialAwesome	2021-04-20 15:16:50+00:00	My 4 (almost 5) year old has developed a tic and I feel like it's my fault	"I was recently diagnosed with a kidney issue that required surgery. My wife and I spent 2 days in the hospital and when I got out, my son developed a tic. He flexes his neck like he is trying to stick his bottom teeth out. He seems to have no control over it and it happens several times per minute. I'm feeling guilty about it because I have read that stress is a major cause of tics. I went from wrestling, climbing, exercising, and doing flips with my son every day to just laying around on the couch in pain for a week. He went from thinking his dad was this amazing, fun, indestructible, super hero to being afraid to even hug me or sit in my lap because he doesn't want to hurt me. It's been a little over a week and I am feeling better and healing up, but he is still incredibly nervous about touching me and the tics haven't slowed down. Have any of you experienced anything similar with your children? And is there anything I can do to make it go away or keep it from getting worse?"

throwawaybandmom	2021-04-20 15:01:50+00:00	Update/More Questions: My teen and marching band	"Previous post if anyone wants it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/lhosrg/help\_14yo\_and\_marching\_band\_do\_i\_let\_her/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/lhosrg/help_14yo_and_marching_band_do_i_let_her/)

The updates: shortly after the OP, we were able to get into counseling. She's been going every week and we have our first family session this week. I can't say we're seeing any major progress, she's still very disrespectful, bullies her brother and has issues with responsibility/apologies, but I see glimmers of hope and appreciate that she is really cooperative with the counselor and is willing/wanting to go. She's doing better in school and turning in her work and I think being on campus again has helped this. Her dad and I also sat down shortly after my OP and agreed that we would sign her up for band and allow her to go on the California trip. She hasn't been putting in very much effort/practice on her instrument ( as she agreed she would) but she seemed excited and I want her to have awesome things, so we stuck with the plan anyway.

...until now? I feel so guilty about this and I don't know if we're doing the right thing. This last week there was a fundraiser with the profits going directly to her student account to pay for her trip. She went around the neighborhood for a few days selling pizzas and ROCKED IT. I think she sold like 100 items total. Seriously, she was so impressive in how she'd talk to people and just hustle. I complimented her on this multiple times, as did her dad. I also told her I'd do her chores for the week so she could focus on her sales. I had to remind her every night to take the cash out of her envelope and leave it in the house so she wouldn't be walking around with so much money. I did this firstly for safety but also because she's absent minded and two years ago she LOST an entire fundraising envelope. Luckily that time around, she lost it at school and it got turned in. 

Well guess what? She did it again. She lost the envelope, but thankfully it's only about 6 checks and maybe $20. My current plan is to have HER go to the lost check houses and explain so they can cancel them and I will pay any bank fees. I will obviously make up any lost cash to the fundraiser. I'm embarrassed and annoyed, but shit happens, right? I mean, I once threw away my car keys on vacation (we found them after a frantic search). I'm not so much mad about the loss as I am at her reaction. When I asked where the envelope was (I wasn't angry when I asked) she screamed at me that I lost it, it was my fault and I must have moved it. She refused to search for it and when she finally did she screamed at her brother for not finding it. I sent her to retrace her steps and apparently, she didn't do that either. I drove the entire subdivision on the off chance that 24 hours later a random envelope was out there somewhere. She also told me the previous lost envelope 2 years ago ""never happened"" and implied I was lying. I've yet to get any sort of remorse over the lost money, just a brazen request if I still wanted to buy pizza and if she could still go on the trip.

Her dad says we should cancel the trip because it's scary to send her. She's immature and we don't feel she's ready. She's constantly forgetting her inhaler (asthmatic), frequently irresponsible and just seems to go mindless on important things. She has lost our house keys and cell phones so many times, she no longer has access to either on a regular basis. Two years ago we let her take an 3 day overnight school trip, she has a nut allergy and I know how she likes to go whole hog on sweets. I warned her multiple times DO NOT take food from other kids. Only eat what we/the school provides. The very first thing she did was binge on cookies with a friend -- and ended up in the emergency room. I had to leave work to make a 2.5 hour drive to get her from the ER. But the school said if I was fine with it and the doctor signed off, she could stay on the trip, so no 'real' consequence to her, but I did get a $300 ambulance/ER bill. I wish I could say this behavior was two years ago and no longer a worry, but I don't feel as if her maturity levels have grown much since then.

I cringe at what could happen with her 3000 miles away on a school trip. Is it wrong to take it away? I thought about going with her on the California trip but I don't  have the money for one person much less two to go (it's about $3000 each). Her dad is genuinely concerned it's more bad news waiting to happen. We both have anxiety. Are we freaking out over nothing? Being unreasonable? Yes, I do plan to discuss this at the family session in a few days.

TLDR: 14yo daughter is not very mature/responsible, may cancel her band trip to the Rose Bowl as a result. Feel like a shitty, horrible parent. I want to give her this and I'm so disappointed that I may not."
tallgirl1995	2021-04-20 14:52:50+00:00	🤔	I have a question for the parents. This might be a weird thing to talk about but I’ve recently come to conclusion that my body needs more sleep and rest compared to others. &amp; when I’m sleep deprived I feel physically sick. I’ve been thinking about how I’ll ever manage to be a parent when I require so much rest. Would y’all recommend that parent route for somebody like me? (Also caffeine doesn’t work for me) Pls be nice. 😭💀
ChrissMiss_Mom	2021-04-20 14:43:38+00:00	I’m NOT SINGLE!!! My kids just have my last name!	"So I was in town with my 2 children(almost 3F and 10month M). Town for reference is an hour away from my house we live in a small semi off grid community. While I was in town with my 2 kids I ended up needing to visit the hospital/ER. They asked if they could call anyone I asked them to call my husband then the nurse looked confused AF. Me: my husband (name). Nurse: oh sorry on the kids paperwork I noticed you and your kids have the same last name but there is no male with the same last name noted. Me: X is my husband he kept his last name when we married.. Nurse looking more confused: K? But we will need a family member for the kids to pick them up I see your mom is listed. Me(mad now): phone their Dad my husband (name). Now I am in pain and don’t want to spend my time explaining nor is it my nurses responsibility to judge/explore my family’s name dynamic. They phoned my husband and let the kids go with him home while I stayed; but the same nurse a day later said it was a favour because they weren’t supposed to let kids go with people who weren’t a bio-relitive/legal guardian. I snapped back then it’s good they left with their biological dad you f’ing nut. 

So my rant: The world is changing, kids sometime take their moms last name. Parents who marry sometimes don’t take each other’s last name. And funny enough for our family my husband is the stay at home parent so really we just happened into a total role reversal situation from many small decisions but it not the job of an outsider to determine how valid my family is. My husband has ran into this trying to sign the kids up for a play space oh get their mom or bio dad to fill this out. Him that’s me these are my kids they just have their moms last name.. I knew what we were doing was unusual but IDK I didn’t think it would come up so much in legal barriers.."
Tomohawk1973	2021-04-20 14:21:36+00:00	Saw a pic of my daughter as a toddler	In the last year I’ve gone from a successful person with an important job (newly qualified nurse) and a father with 4 of my 5 kids at home to being unemployed after a breakdown and exhaustion leading to me losing my job and my son causing a massive family split. He did a terrible crime that came to light last September and it’s destroyed us. I just about thought I was getting on with my life when I saw a picture on Facebook memories of my daughter (who’s now 8) as a one-year-old. She’s eating an Easter bunny chocolate and has this Devine face of pure joy in the picture. It’s a beautiful thing and when I saw it I started to cry at my children growing up and I miss them at that age when they need you. My eldest is 23 and it was my second eldest that committed this crime. I look at this picture and see that child-like joy and I literally cannot stop crying. I feel broken and cannot remember the last time I felt joy like my girl in that pic. Probably the wrong place to post this but I guess I thought parents might understand.
Swish18	2021-04-20 14:18:55+00:00	13 month old sleep issues	"Our 13 month old is making the transition from 2-1 naps. He usually goes to sleep around 8, wakes up about 8, with a 2 hour nap between 12-3 somewhere. Issue is that he is waking up every two ish hours at night. Any advice?"
Laudaaaa	2021-04-20 13:59:07+00:00	Toddler ankle pronation - will it correct itself?	"My 2 year old son has had pronated ankles (where the ankles tilt towards the inside of the foot and the weight bearing happens on the inner foot) since he could stand and it has not changed whatsoever as he grew up a bit. His pediatrician isn't concerned and said it should correct itself, but I seriously think she is wrong because it has not improved even slightly in over a year, even with using arch support insoles in his shoes. Does anyone have any insight on this - specifically if it will correct itself with time or if intervention is needed (ie. ankle brace supports from an ortho specialist)? He appears to have completely normal arches in his feet when he isn't standing. Thanks so much for reading :)"
PM5k	2021-04-20 13:49:12+00:00	"My son is nearly two now, still not talking or attempting babbling. Can I do anything?"	"So my boy is a month away from his second birthday, and he is generally just a ball of energy and happiness. He plays, explores, looks and plays with stuff he finds interesting, he also understands lots of things we tell him verbally like:

“It’s night time” - where he drops on the floor, squeals for half a second and then giggles and pretends he does not see us. Or goes to hide in his teepee as a response. 

“Get me your ball” - if he’s interested enough he will bring one of his coloured balls. 

“It’s breakfast/lunch/dinner time”, “don’t climb the stairs/get down from the stairs” or “it’s time to change your nappy”. 

So he definitely comprehends what is being said to him, and if he wants a snack he will take me by the hand and drag me into the kitchen and in front of the snack cupboard to signal he wants a treat. 

Me and my partner talk to him constantly, point to things and name them, ask for things from him and try to use small words that can be easily substituted by a baby for babble phrases like - cup/cuu, bowl/boh, ball/ba and so on. No big words when we talk to him. 

Anyway, we do that, we also tried the baby sign language. We try to point at books with pictures or describe stuff going on during play time like “look daddy is playing with the bus” or “catch the ball” and stuff like that. 

Yet still, he’s very non-verbal. Even though lots of people keep telling me boys talk later (and I myself didn’t start till 2.5y ) - It’s worrying me a lot. Before, I was worried that he may be autistic, but he makes plenty of eye contact, is constantly smiling (98% of his day he is one huge smiling potato) and he even gives unsolicited kisses (more like tries to eat your nose or mouth) or even cuddles. So the typical “signs” of autism like coldness, avoiding eye contact and so on aren’t there afaik. But I’m also aware it’s a spectrum and not a binary state, so I really can’t say anymore. Sometimes he will spend ten minutes running along a fence outside cause he likes the zooming pattern he sees from the gaps in the fence. He loves cars and chasing his reflection in ye paint job. So.. not sure if it’s anything to worry about when it comes to his fixations. What I do know is that I desperately want him to talk and I feel like I’ve run out of things to try. I just want to see some progress, even silly baby babbles that vaguely resemble words rather than squealing or yelling would probably make me weep from joy at this point. 

Do any of you have any experience with this? What can I do?"
gizel13	2021-04-20 13:48:01+00:00	Travel with newborn	"Hi 

I’m looking for advice to sense check my position on this situation because husband and I don’t agree. Really torn up. 

Long story short. Best friend getting married in May. I agreed to be MOH before covid. She’s now postponed wedding 4 times. Meanwhile I got pregnant and had a baby now 3 mos old. 

Wedding is 50-60 ppl. Sit down dinner etc. Mostly outdoors but ceremony indoors. Not everyone will be masked. It’s about 5 hour drive from us out of state. Baby will have to come with because BF but not to venue. Husband and I vaccinated. 

I’ve talked with her about my fears re covid and newborn. Probably had convo too late as she was pissed I didn’t bring up sooner. She had never asked me how I’d handle it or how she could accommodate so I wrongly assumed she’d understand if we couldn’t swing it. 

I’m TERRIFIED of risks to baby with pandemic but also would be sad not to be there for friend and risk friendship. Thoughts, internet strangers?"
Ducklanding20	2021-04-20 13:41:29+00:00	11 month monster	"I just don’t know what to do. My 11 month old has become a terror. He whines constantly. And I use that word literally. He’s not crying, no tears, he’s just whining. Doesn’t want to be held. Doesn’t want to be put down. Starts whining immediately after he’s done eating. Doesn’t want to watch cartoons. Doesn’t want to play with toys. Doesn’t want to go outside. Doesn’t want to cuddle. Doesn’t want to sleep. Doesn’t have to go to the bathroom. Tylenol doesn’t work. Doesn’t have an ear infection. I’m at my wits end here. The whining turns to full blown tantrums if I tell him no, turns into full blown wailing if I leave a room to use the bathroom. He was SUCH a great baby up until these past couple of weeks. I wouldn’t mind all of the indecisiveness if it wasn’t met with constant whining. We’ve tried teaching him some sign language just to break some of the communication barrier because I know he’s at an age where it’s frustrating to not be able to voice what’s wrong but we definitely started too late as the whining had already begun at that point so he has no interest. I almost feel like a piece of crap having to ask for help now but I’m at my wits end. Is this just a phase for this age? Or am I screwed."
fallenangel91	2021-04-20 13:38:08+00:00	Post natal depression. The Worst feeling	"So, I'm not here to get sympathy,  ask advice or anything but more to alleviate my feelings. 
My daughter is now going through the lovely teething stage so the last 3 nights have been horrible. Screaming at bed time, waking at 3am and every subsequent hour... well if you're reading this I'm sure you're aware. 

My 9 year old coped so much better with this and we barely noticed his teething stage to start with.

However, with all the sleep deprivation, her not even settling for an afternoon nap and such, I literally feel myself going insane. Shouting, crying... the lot. 

I am at the point where clearly I need to call my GP and get help, an ofcourse with it comes the feeling of being a terrible mum, and hating myself for being unable to cope.

Thank you for reading my rant, as typing this helped calm me down slightly"
Creepy_Fun_4937	2021-04-20 13:02:02+00:00	HELP We both end up crying😞	"My 7 year old is struggling with math.  She bombed a test and her teacher is allowing her to redo it but im struggling to understand her math enough to help her. 😣

Some background: My husband and I became parents at a young age(both 16) now we are both 24 and have 4 wonderful children. 2 of which go to school. I have struggled with math my whole life and now my oldest daughter is too. Her teacher suggested we do some more practice at home. I am trying, I really am but I hardly understand her math even though it's just 1st grade math. It normally ends with both of us crying and frustrated. I'd ask my husband to help but by time he gets off work it is time for dinner and baths and then bed. I'm afraid I'm having a negative impact on her education because I honestly have no idea how to help. I know basic math(add subtract multiply divide) but how they're having them do it now makes no sense to me. I message her teacher for help and she helps with what she can but sometimes I leave the convo more confused then when I started. I will google it or youtube it for help and sometimes that works great but other times not so much. I asked for a tutor but the school no longer does after school tutoring thanks to Covid. I'm truly at a loss here. Any other parents feel this way or have this issue? What has helped? 

If this was any other subject we would be fine because i did great in every other area of school. *sigh* 😞

Thank you in advance. 

(Please no comments about this is why babies shouldn't have babies etc. I get that on every single subreddit I post on about my kids. My age really has nothing to do with my math abilities)"
lyssatola	2021-04-20 12:56:46+00:00	The ongoing case of the kid not staying in her room...	"So in addition to our 5 year old getting up and wandering the house in the wee hours in the morning (see previous post). 

Last night she was caught taking money out of my purse...at 3:30am. Despite knowing she is not to touch my purse and that she's not to be DOWN-FRIGGIN-STAIRS in the middle of the night.

She was also wandering in and out of her room to the downstairs starting at 5:30am. When I went in to tell her to stop coming out her room, there was lipstick, lip balm, and a bottle of hand sanitizer from my purse on display like they were little friggin trophies.

When we asked her about why she was up and why she needed those items...she remembers being downstairs but had no answer as to why she did it or why she needed them. 

I'm thinking we need a gate at the top of the stairs to keep her on the top floor at night but eventually she's going to figure out how to use it. 

What am I missing here? I am so damned tired - I am getting to the point where feel like one of us has to be up at all hours of the day/night to make sure she doesn't get into stupid shit."
Arielcinderellaauror	2021-04-20 12:56:32+00:00	Do we prepare 5year old for the death of family cat or wait until it happens?	"My daughter is 5 and obsessed with our very elderly cat (19 years old) he's not in good health at all, he still has quality of life and no pain, he goes out and about still etc 

He has an over active thyroid and quoting the vet the most irregular heartbeat he's ever heard, he's also getting a bit constipated now. The vet visit was after he had lost a dramatic amount of weight so he's very skinny. He didn't react well with the medication for the thyroid issue and it would have done him more harm to stay on them so we're letting nature take its course as he's well exceeded his life expectancy and there's nothing that can be done about his heart issue at his age. 

Being 5 years old she's not really experienced death at all and he would be a huge loss for her I don't know if I should tell her so she is more prepared for it or just wait until he dies instead of having two traumatic experiences. I don't want her worrying about it everyday and feeling sad but I'm also worried about the huge shock it will be as she doesn't seem to understand when we say he's very old and what that really means however hard we try and explain. 

Also do we say he's gone to heaven even though we're not religious?"

siennesmith	2021-04-20 11:45:28+00:00	What was the best and worst nutrition advice you received during your pregnancy?	" I think that the best pregnancy nutrition advice is to be careful about pregnancy nutritional advice lol. There’s just so much misinformation and contradictory information floating around that I had reached a point where I felt overwhelmed and unsure about even the smallest of decisions regarding my pregnancy diet. That’s how I learned it’s important to fact check ANY advice you get from family, friends (or internet strangers) with authoritative sources such as government sites or reliable and trustworthy websites. Creating a healthy pregnancy diet plan which will allow you to meet your nutritional requirements as well as give you some much-needed peace of mind knowing that your LO is getting everything he/she needs to grow and develop, is also helpful. You can check out [this](https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well/) link for everything you need to know when creating your pregnancy diet plan. 

Getting back to medically incorrect pregnancy nutritional advice or as I also like to call it – the worst nutrition advice – I thought that I would cover just two of the most harmful ones so that you can see the fallout from following such advice. I had probably been told by countless people that I am now “eating for two” but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Sure, my calorie requirements were higher during pregnancy but they were not double! In fact, I did not need to increase my calorie intake at all during my first trimester. During my second trimester, my daily calorie requirements increased by only 340 calories and by 450 calories in the third trimester. Also, please don’t just take my word for it, check out [this](https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandnutrition.html) link for more info on your calorie requirements during pregnancy. Just to put that calorie increase in proper perspective, I covered those additional 340 calories with just one large apple (116 calories), 1 tablespoon of peanut butter (94 calories), and 10 walnut halves (130 calories). 

Unfortunately, the myth of “eating for two” is so pervasive, that we drastically increase our calorie intake which leads to unhealthy weight gain during pregnancy. This excessive weight gain during pregnancy increases the risk of several health issues including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. What’s worse is that the baby is more likely to grow up to be overweight or obese as well as have a lifelong elevated cardiovascular and metabolic risk. 

Another incorrect pregnancy nutritional advice that I received will definitely have to be the use of Ayurvedic products and especially the ones that target pregnant women. Unfortunately, what most women don’t know is that the FDA does NOT review or approve ANY Ayurvedic products – so the label that states that the product is only made with “certified FDA approved ingredients” is misleading. In fact, the FDA issued a warning that 1 in 5 of all Ayurvedic preparations contains toxic metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic. Exposure to these metals has been linked to a variety of serious health issues, especially for unborn babies such as decreased fetal bone growth, brain damage, hearing and vision problems, and intrauterine growth retardation. So to sum it all up please please talk to your doctor before you add any tonic or supplement to your diet, especially the ones that are “recommended” to you by anyone that is not a doctor."
Monztur	2021-04-20 11:40:09+00:00	Need advice: 2 year old is a runner	"I'm a SAHM to a little boy who's turning 2 next week. 

I have been having an ongoing problem since he learned to crawl where I spend most of my day chasing him. 

If we aren't holding his hand he will bolt and keep running indefinitely never looking back. 

It's extremely stressful for me because he can open the gates at playgrounds and will just bolt. 

I keep trying to take him for toddler activities, but he just spends the whole time trying to run out of the exits. 

I see this behaviour a bit in other kids, but I have never met a kid where it's so extreme. He's totally out of control and I'm worried I'm not going to be able to catch him one day and he'll run off and get lost or hurt. I'm sick of having to be 100% focused on him at all times when I see other parents of toddlers being able to let them play at the playground a bit more independently. I hate being a helicopter parent, but his behaviour is dangerous if I'm not hoovering. 

It doesn't help that he refuses to use a pram (he fights so hard getting in that it felt like it was getting abusive tackling him in). I use one of those toddler backpacks with a leash, and hold his hand to get anywhere. This obviously isn't ideal.

Has anyone with older kids dealt with this? Can you give me some hope that this is just a very long phase? Any tips? I'm at the point where I don't want to take him anywhere."

wingsonawidow	2021-04-20 09:42:59+00:00	"My sister (28) and I(29F) had bad childhoods, we have no clue what we are doing"	"My sister and I did not have the best upbringing, our mother was honestly terrible and we are trying so hard to be better. But when the kids start acting up really bad we just don’t know how to handle it and we can’t tell if they are being normal children or if the behavior is excessive. 
For example, middle child who we will call R, is 8 and has a lot of melt downs over minor things. Yesterday it was because she was trying to get a drink but couldn’t tell if the dishes on the counter were clean or dirty so she like melted onto the floor, started scratching herself and basically shut down. I explained that if a dish is on the counter next to the sink it’s most likely dirty and she should always check the cupboards for clean cups. She has these meltdowns often, she also has pretty hardcore anxiety but her father refuses to allow us to see a therapist at all. It’s like whenever things are not clear and specific she panics and her brain shuts down and she starts scratching herself and the more upset she gets the less she is able to listen and communicate.
The youngest is 2, we will call him A. When my nieces were his age they could count to 30, say their alphabet and communicated in clear sentences with 4 and 5 letter words. Little man is really hard to understand and he gets frustrated when we can’t understand what he says. He also just does. Not. Listen. Not that he isn’t well behaved, imo being a non parent, he is much more behaved than most children. But when we try to sit him down and talk to him he absolutely refuses to look at us and hear what we are saying and won’t take no for an answer, does whatever he wants or cries about it. 
He is also EXTREMELY clingy and will not give my sister a moment to herself no matter what. The other day, all three kids were being awful and she was trying to cook dinner and he was at her feet demanding to be picked up, on repeat no stopping no listening and she snapped a bit and pushed him. Personally I don’t blame her at all, I would have done the same thing. But we were both badly abused and we both believe that you shouldn’t ever have to get physical with children. But in 100% honesty we do not know how to teach in any other way. If he is refusing to listen and continuously in between her and a hot stove while she’s also dealing with the girls being really bad, what the hell are you supposed to do? 
He wasn’t hurt, he didn’t get pushed hard, I think it hurt his feelings more than anything. But we both acknowledge that there’s gotta be a better way. And is it normal for kids his age to still not communicate this well? Do most 2 y/o’s have trouble listening like this and being this clingy? We don’t know what to do or how to handle it.

The eldest, H, gives us the least problems. She’s 11 and she’s the helper. But I feel like my sister puts too much responsibility on her then yells at her when she snaps at the younger ones telling her not to be a parent. And she has a point there but I don’t think she should put all the responsibilities she does on her and then snap at her like that when she steps in while they are fighting or misbehaving. 

Anyway, we are incredibly overwhelmed, I help as much as I can but I am also working. I have experience as a step mom but that was like 7 years ago and as an aunt I don’t want to cross lines with my sister. But she’s even more overwhelmed than I am. Any tips or even some outside perspective would be very much appreciated. Also want to add that I basically rescued them all from my abusive family and we have been living with 5 of us in my 1 bedroom apartment for the past month. We finally just got accepted into a bigger place and can start moving next week tho, but that’s where we are at."
SCATOL92	2021-04-20 09:19:33+00:00	Will this cleaning habit cause future problems?	"So when my kids were younger, if they were angry or stressed I would help them address those problems and then we would clean together. We would say ""let's scrub away that anger"" or ""let's tidy away those stressful thoughts"".

 Now they're 9, 11 and 13 and they just do this instinctively. Recently my 11 year old ""rage quit"" a video game he was frustrated with and ran downstairs to the cleaning cupboard and then cleaned all the windows and mirrors. It seems to actually help them and it's been great for them (and me!).

The problem is that last night my 13 year old was working on an essay for history homework. I went upstairs to take him some fruit and he was just sitting in his bedroom floor organising his sock drawer. I asked him what was going on and he said he was a bit stressed out with essay and he would get back to it in a minute. I helped him finish his socks and then helped him work on the essay. I'm worried that I have created this habit in them that they'll now use to procrastinate. Is this actually a healthy way to deal with stress? I'm questioning everything now."
TryNotToAssume	2021-04-20 09:07:50+00:00	Husband complains about being tired but he doesn't get up in the night	"I've had a rough couple of nights and just need a bit of a rant. Feel free to ignore.

I know there is a bit of a imbalance between what I do and what my husband does. He's very stressed with work though. It's something I will address once he's settled into his new job in a month or so.

What is really getting to me is him complaining about not getting enough sleep. He puts the baby to bed, usually around 8 or 9pm. Then he does whatever he wants until he goes to bed, usually around 11pm and gets up at 7.30am to look after the baby until 8.30am. At weekends he gets up when he wants.

I get up with the baby and see to all his needs. My husband ignores anything once he's put him down to sleep until 7.30.

The last couple of nights I've had basically no sleep as baby has been getting up every 1-2 hours.

My husband tells me he's not getting enough sleep and he's tired. That the baby disturbs him and he wakes up in the night. He tells his coworkers that he's tired because the baby had a rough night. He will  joke with them that it's the life of a new parent and fishes for sympathy.

I don't think he realises how tough it is for me. I don't think he'd last a week if he had to actually get up in the night and didn't get to stay in bed at the weekends.

He tells me I should nap during the day but makes a big deal of watching the baby (he won't sleep in his cot during the day) and at weekends theres always something he needs to do that doesn't allow me time to nap.

I feel like I can barely function. I've cried twice already today"

settlers_of_dunshire	2021-04-20 07:10:26+00:00	"Today my ""pandemic baby"" waved at strangers."	"I'm a cancer survivor who wasn't supposed to be capable of procreation, but it happened so yay! As part of some huge cosmic joke that is my life, my son was born on February 29, 2020. We were SO excited to introduce him to the family and enjoy all of those precious family moments. But...By the time we were released from the hospital the world was shutting down. We lives hundreds of miles away from everyone we know, so flights were cancelled and tearful video chats were had. 

Here we are, nearly 14 months later. Due to distance and my health history, not a single family member or friend has met him. We video chat and we take daily walks, so he is aware that other people exist... But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried about his social development through all of this. I know that losing a parent (me) would impact his life far more than a year of isolation, so I swallow my sorrow and my doubt as much as possible. 

Lately he has been exhibiting signs of curiosity about others. He will watch other people at the park, and since we don't act fearful he seems to accept their presence. A few days ago he saw two boys playing soccer and he babbled and motioned in their direction to me. I should mention that he can run and kick a soccer ball, but this was the first time he saw others doing it. 

Then today, he randomly started waving and yelling ""hi"" to people in the park. My heart almost exploded. A little boy went jogging by and my kid took off after him waving and yelling hi and laughing. We took him around the park so we could keep him at a distance while practicing his new skill. It's so small, and for most kids this step might not even be noticed. But for me, this meant the world. My child has been isolated from people for his entire life, but he is still somehow a social and friendly little person. I can't wait for the day we get to introduce him to our friends and family. I know it will be a transition that requires patience and understanding, but I feel so much better about it now."

"I am currently working abroad and i have a chance to get my girlfriend and son(9yo) here with me as my dependents but i am worried that my son would have a hard time adjusting here and would end up being bullied by other kids because he is a foreigner. My son really wants to come here and is determined to go to school here but that might just be because of a ""grass is greener"" mentality he has right now. Am i making the right decision getting them here? How am i going to help with my son's adjustments and roadblocks he will face once he comes here? For anyone in the UK, how are the schools here and how rampant is the bullying in schools?"

Far more kids commit suicide than are kidnapped by strangers. We are not giving our kids smart phones. We want to know if there are any parenting groups that follow the same philosophy.

bexla4	2021-04-20 04:21:39+00:00	Need boy advice as I’m a single mom with no male to really confide in!	"My 6 year old son from time to time will come to me telling me that his private hurts. Specifically, the tip of his penis and says it burns when he pees. Now my initial thought is a possible UTI but he says when he puts lotion on it, it makes it feel better. I looked at it and it doesn’t seem to be dry nor are there any little dry patches (he has mild eczema). My oldest son (9) came in to tell me he thinks it’s because he doesn’t rinse the soap all the way off when he showers. Then proceeded to show him what he does to “get all of the soap out” because “the same thing happened to him before” and he realized it was the soap that would make it burn when he peed after a shower. Is this a thing?! I’m a single lesbian mom so this is way out of my range of knowledge. Thank you for any advice you can give!"
confusedandstresed	2021-04-20 03:58:30+00:00	My boyfriend's mother is weirdly obsessed over my unborn child...	"At first it started with little comments whenever I came round which I didn't find as big of a deal but now they do make me angry to look back on- she was talking directly to my boyfriend in front of me how shes taking her grandchild to Florida to disneyland when he's 4/5 years old (we live in the UK, so very far away)...or kept referring to my boyfriends old bedroom as the ""baby room"" or saying how he's going to be ""spoilt rotten"" and that makes me cringe so much I don't want my child to be spoilt.

She also kept asking me about a baby shower which I have told countless times I do not want, I don't want gifts from people I've never spoken to it would be very uncomfortable for me. Then she said how she's DOING a ""family gathering"" at her house and to invite my mum and sister, I didn't clock on at first and said that I'll ask, then my boyfriend told me how shes basically just planning a baby shower, especially how shes planning to do it in August (the baby would only be a few weeks old) and I literally do not want lots of people around my baby when it's only a few weeks old, hell, I don't even want to go anywhere after having him for probably a few MONTHS as I'd literally just be adjusting to everything.

Then we went over for ""dinner"" 2 days ago, literally since that experience I can't sleep...it's 4am right now lol. 
We started eating the food she prepared and my boyfriend pointed out how the chips aren't edible, and I gave him a death stare bc it's rude to say that, but then I tried it and I understood completely...then he did it AGAIN with the chicken and literally had to spit it out, fair to say I didn't try that.
Besides the point I felt really awkward but I was still polite and just ate the sweetcorn.
She then started saying how auntie tony will never have anything to do with the baby, like to point out I have no idea who auntie tony is, and this sounded so possessive in my opinion and idk what type of weird dinner conversation that was but she started being really rude saying that she's as dumb as pig shi💩 etc etc it was very uncomfortable.

Later on she then proceeded to talk about what we are going to do about CHRISTMAS and the baby...saying how her family has her ""traditions"" and then my bf pointed out ""but I thought you don't like Christmas"" and she was like ""I hate it but I still want to spend time with the baby"" I told her that I'll probably spend Christmas Eve and Christmas morning at my mum's with the baby, and she was like ""ok so we're having him on Christmas day but I wanted to have the baby in the morning to spend time with him before the big gathering"" and I literally just stopped talking after that wtf... Im already dreading being there for Christmas day, and she expects me to come there before 10am so she can spend ""time with the baby"" what type of tradition is that?? Just sounds possessive to me...
Or saying if we could rotate that year to year... Like why tf are you planning so far ahead it's so strange to me.


I told my sister about everything and she said that it's really creepy how much she's planning ahead when it's not even her child...

Today I also realized she put MY BABY SCAN picture as her Facebook profile picture last month, wtf??? Who does that??? 

I'm honestly so done like wtf do I do this is really weird and is making me really stressed out, the baby isn't even here yet..."

Is  there anyone, female or male, that has dealt with the reality of  accidental pregnancy despite of contraception and a child as its  consequence in any way? (Or even forced fatherhood as the NY Times  calles it.)

As it's become a just  as beautiful as cruel reality for myself, I would love to connect with  conscious parents that did not become them by their own choice. Perhaps,  we can share some experiences and advice and exchange some of the quite  unique teachings this situation has to offer.

Even  if you have dealt with a similiar situation in a very different way or  something else makes it difficult to share; please don't feel judged!  I'm really just looking for perspectives based in experience – no matter  if they are coherent with my own ethics in this case.

Much love and greetings from Peru!"

Instead of prayer - we share one thing we’re grateful for at every meal.

bonzombiekitty	2021-04-20 02:31:44+00:00	4 year old has never been afraid of anything until now	"My 4yo daughter has never been scared of anything.  Never had an issue with the dark.  Was never worried about monsters or ghosts.  She's enjoyed scary things. A lot.  She likes shows and movies that would be fairly intense for age.  When she watched Brave, she was cheering on the fight between the bears, while her much older cousins had to leave the room.

That changed today.  Suddenly she's afraid to play by herself in her room, which she usually likes to do.  And she was afraid to go bed.  What frightened her so much?  Did she manage to watch a stone scenes from a horror movie?  Did she witness some tragic event?  No.

It was an episode of the Magic frickin School Bus.  Somehow Miss Frizzle had manage to frighten a girl whose favorite movie is The Nightmare Before Christmas."
RAH67881	2021-04-20 02:28:30+00:00	"My son's(6) emotional/attention bucket is never full, i'm at my wits end!"	"He's just causing me so much stress with the constant need for attention. I feel like I can't get anything done when he's home especially on the weekends and with summer break around the corner i juat feel its going to get worse. It's like he forgets that we (me or dad or both) have just spent hours entertaining him and is right back under our feet. He won't play on his own and would rather sit doing nothing if we're not entertaining him. When we finally do get him to do something he starts to tear up the house or break his toys. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, theres only so much entertaining I can muster. If you take a moment to do something for your self, it's a fit of ""you never do anything for me"" or ""why can't I have it"". It's to the point when bed time rolls around we say good night and then when the door closes any and all ""good nights"" and ""I'll see you in the mornings"" he shouts through the door go unanswered. I'm done. 

Any advice on how to get him to entertain himself for any length of time would be appreciated, he does suffer from ADHD and is currently taking medication, so I'm unsure if I would say this is related to that or just a him thing."
daffy_april	2021-04-20 02:23:11+00:00	16 year old wants to drop out	"So my 16 year old, bright, sensitive, intense son wants to drop out of school. He wants to be a game streamer on twitch and doesn't see how school will benefit him. He never completes his assignments, is failing all his courses and nothing we do/say is helping the situation. I get emails from his teachers complaining about him and I have nothing to say to them. He just doesn't listen. No amount of bribery or punishment has worked on him. And I don't want to force him or treat him like a child. 

He doesn't want to go to college and wants to start working right away, willing to take 2-3 jobs if he can only stream (bc I've told him he can't live here for free). He says he loves learning new things but hates tests and assignments. I dropped out of college (and barely made it through high school) and now making multiple 6 figures in my own business now which he keeps pointing out. I've told him to at least finish high school but he says (in a very rationale voice) that it's a waste of 2 years of his life(!). 

I guess I'm asking if it would be SO crazy to let him leave high school. I mean the worst that will happen is he regrets the decision and goes back to get his GED and college degree. Right?"

My LO is 16 months and is speech delayed. He has said words however they're very inconsistent. The words also come out... Elongated? It's so hard to describe. They're soft sounding and sound more like sounds than words. Ex: bird is buuuuuuuuuur. He responds well however tends to reply in a sing songy way. I'm sorry I don't have a better way to explain it. It isn't babbling - there's no mama or dada or baba. It's.. ooooohwaw, oooooooh,. He changes pitch too. Most of the time, I understand what the sounds are. It's almost like when someone hums a word - you know the word by the sound even though it wasn't said outloud.

Does anyone know what I'm trying to explain? 
He's on the waitlist for speech therapy however, I need to better understand what's going on and our PCP is.. not great and the waitlist is a year minimum.

I appreciate your help. Thank you."
Dreaming_Tree	2021-04-20 02:16:05+00:00	Sleep for two kids (3 &amp; 4) in newly divorced household.	"I have two children, 3 and 4 years old, who until recently have been sleeping in their own rooms. When my ex and I split two months ago, I stayed in the three bedroom where we were and she went to a two bedroom for now. She has them in a trundle bed, and it seems to be going well over there. The issue is that my 3 year old just got out of the crib literally the week of the split. It was necessary anyways especially with him being in a trundle bed at her house. Now that half the week is spent in the same room, they’re struggling to sleep separate at my place. So I figured it wouldn’t harm them to have them in the same room here too. For a year leading into the split though, my ex wife would sleep in my oldest kids room on a twin mattress on the floor, so now she struggles without someone in the room with her... but my youngest is consistently getting out of bed which gets her anxious about being alone. No matter how many times I walk my youngest back to bed, timeouts, etc, he consistently gets back out. At this point I don’t know what to do. He’s keeping her awake by consistently trying to play or just be out of the room, but I don’t even know how she will be if I take him out entirely and she’s alone for the first time in 1.5 years. Is it bad to just put him in his own room and baby gate him in? Then work on my oldest being able to sleep without someone in the room? Bed time has been fucking rough every single time. Exhausted and looking for opinions."
afinky	2021-04-20 02:00:00+00:00	Help! How to handle this weird gym teacher behavior (6th grade boy)	"My ADHD fidgety 6th grade son goes to a school that includes a martial arts class (which sounds awesome, I know). He's not very coordinated and a few weeks ago the teacher demonstrated how unstable his stance was by kicking his foot and knocking him over- my kid got pretty banged up. I get that this could be a normal martial arts teaching technique but it wound up humiliating my son so much that he just started avoiding school/class on days when he knew he had to go to martial arts. When I found out he was skipping, I mentioned the incident to the school and they forced the teacher to ""check in"" with my son (which I imagine was awkward for them both but I figured it was behind us.)

Today my son sneaked into the school office, used the phone to call me saying he needed to be picked up and the school knew about it. When I got there, I found out that he had lied about the teachers knowing and was about to be pretty mad about it until we were a foot from the car and he burst into hysterical sobbing saying that the martial arts teacher had made fun of him in front of the whole class today-- in a mocking tone saying, ""what are you going to do, call mommy and daddy?"" when he got a scrape from a fall.

I'm struggling with how to handle this because it's not an optional elective but talking to the administration just made the borderline bullying behavior worse. My son is begging to not have to go back to class and I'm just not sure what to do. On one hand, if I let the school know what happened and ask for him to be excused from the class or talk to the teacher, it could cause an even worse feedback loop of retaliation. On the other, if I say nothing and he has to keep going. For a normally developing kid this would probably be a ""toughen up"" or ""these things happen"" moment but for those of you who had ADHD or other developmental delays in middle school- you know how completely difficult this might be for a kid without emotional self regulation. He's been forced to being near-tears in front of the whole school twice now. 

Intervene or stay out of it?"
not30flirtythriving	2021-04-20 01:52:44+00:00	Seeking advice on how to tell my kids my relationship with my boyfriend has ended.	"I’ve been in a relationship with someone for nine months. It got serious pretty quickly as I have two young boys (3 and 5). Their father doesn’t help much so I have them pretty much 100% of the time with no help from family, which made casual dating pretty impossible, thus the rapid progression of my new relationship.
Anyway, I met someone who was single with no children and he never really connected with them. He just isn’t a “kid” kind of guy; despite basically living here and doing all duties of a “stepfather” for them. He loves me a lot, and I think he struggles with the idea of settling down to a family that isn’t his.
He ended the relationship today pretty abruptly and selfishly. I am left alone and I’m struggling to deal with grieving the relationship, as well as somehow trying to say anything to my kids who are asking for him. I thought he was a permanent fixture in my life (and my kids’) but he left and has left me in pretty much radio silence. 

Has anyone been through something similar? How do I break it to them that someone they love isn’t here anymore? It was different when the relationship with their dad ended because atleast they still see eachother and is in their lives but this won’t be the same."
Epwavl	2021-04-20 01:33:56+00:00	Talk to me about the third child	"We have two amazing children, 1 and 4. Girl/boy. We always assumed we’d have two- but now I’m giving away all our baby stuff and it’s sort of breaking my heart! I think part of it is several people that we’re close to had/are having a third, which I always secretly thought was pure insanity, but now am feeling a bit wistful. Our situation is different- in all of these situations the mom is a SAHM, but I and my husband both work outside of the home full time (similar salaries but my job is more demanding). We don’t have any family around. We’re paying a crazy amount for full time daycare, and a third would possibly take us from comfortable to tight budget-wise. So I know it’s crazy, and I think I’m just feeling these things because if the finality of giving everything away. It really surprises me though- I really drug my feet deciding when to have #2. But now seeing the joy he brought to us after my initial fear makes me wonder if a 3D would be exactly the same- a little more work but a lot more love. 
In my mind- pros- I love my kids so much, more fun/inters family, lifetime support of multiple siblings (I’m one of 3 myself, but my parents had lots of help). I also had very easy pregnancies. Cons- financial stress for us, affects on college savings etc for the others, even less time with the 2 than I have now- which honestly I always feel like is never enough, it will be more difficult to travel, go out, etc. plus being outnumbered in terms of being able to be involved with every kids events/sports etc. we’d both have to get new cars. 

Please tell me a third is super hard and I’m just having baby fever from saying goodbye emotionally to the concept. Anyone go through a period of wondering but are happy you stuck with 2?
Thanks!"

Cant-Take-Jokes	2021-04-20 00:23:31+00:00	Am I Overreacting?	"Now 15 month old started daycare four months ago. Admittedly, she's a little behind with motor skills. She refuses to crawl or eat food most of the time and can't walk yet. 

We sent her to this daycare specifically because they were known for being elite in academics. They said they would have no trouble helping her crawl, walk, and eat, that she'd be 'caught up in no time'. We were fully prepared to supplement at home, we just don't know what to do and were hoping they would help since she wasn't responding to anything we tried.  

Since we have started, we've constantly noticed they weren't following the schedule and the care workers were being far too lax ( sitting on the ground doing nothing, talking to each other instead of doing activites, skipping outside and activities, etc)(There is a camera, we can watch). When we bring it up, they will fix it, but then revert back. They haven't been helping her at all, and we've noticed she just sits and plays by herself most of the time. We requested their help letting them know that she was seeing the daycare behavior specialist and she recommended it, and they still rarely helped despite their promises. 

Given that she has problems eating, we gave them formula and at enrollment were told the caretakers would give her baby food if she didn't eat particularly well that day. However we noticed that they did it a few times then never again. We brought it up and they said they've never done it and wouldn't. We went to the director who said that was completely untrue and she would talk to them, and they did it for a few days before stopping again. I also told them we didn't want her to have juice, but they've given her juice multiple times and then say that it wasn't on the file when I know it is. 

They do activities where they 'color' and 'learn letters', but the papers are clearly the caretakers coloring and tracing the letters for them. I'm gonna be real, she refuses to even hold a crayon, she didn't do those. Not sure what they're trying to do there. There are supposed to be real music teachers and language teachers ( I know silly for so young but it's never too early ) but they aren't available because of covid with no telling when they'll be back. These are a 'perk' of the steep price.

A month ago, we were called because another girl bit her in the face and arm. There were defined bite marks, two of them, but the bruising didn't last long. They had no excuse for why it happened. Then a week later, called again because she fell out of her chair and smacked her head. Okay, that happens. But today we were called and she was bitten again. This time there were multiple bruises all over her face. It doesn't look like she was just bitten. They said it was because one of the people went on break and there was only one person in the room who was changing a diaper despite there supposed to be a 1/6 ratio and there are 12 kids. 

I'm so disappointed because I had such high hopes for this place, but how many promises can they go back on and how many times is my kid going to get hurt? I want to pull her out, but I'm not sure where else to send her. Are they all the same? SO says I'm overreacting and this would happen anywhere. 

Veteran parents and anyone out there that's been through this - what would you do? Does this really happen everywhere? What should I do? 

TL:DR Daycare isn't holding up on promises and child keeps getting injured on their watch. Is it overreacting to switch?"

pamplemousseephemere	2021-04-20 00:02:02+00:00	Caught my toddler watching videos of cartoon characters kissing	"Hi,

So my toddler is 4 years old and has an iPad (I know, bad thing) and I just caught her watching a youtube video of two characters from Teen Titans the new gen (idk what it’s called) kissing/pecking each other and I don’t know what to do.

She’s literally only 4, so it’s not like she had any sexual thoughts while watching it, and she was probably just curious. But at the same time, she went and hid in her room to watch it.

How should I approach the subject (she has a high EQ and is able to hold a serious conversation to a certain point) ?

I mean, it’s a touchy subject, but I don’t want to make her feel weirded out or to think that it’s bad to kiss people, but at the same time, I just think she’s too young to watch that."

I'm doing research for a University project in Italy. I'm specifically interested in knowing:  
1.  Which are your favorite baby food brands? And why do you choose them? (low price, high quality, good packaging etc.)   
2.  Why do you prefer to prepare homemade food?   
3.  Why do you consider baby led weaning important (BLW)?   


 Thank you very much for those who answer. It can help me a lot! :)"

TrickyNikkiB	2021-04-19 23:45:57+00:00	Colicky baby. Help	"My second born has been very difficult. Pushing my husband and I to the breaking point and making daycare go insane. I'm fearful that she will not take him soon. He is 11 weeks old today. He crys alot.He spits up alot. Even hours after eating. Many times it's clear. 
His pediatrician isn't concerned as he is healthily gaining weight and seems fine in that aspect.  I think he's gotten better over the last few weeks but it's still nothing like my first son.  We've gone from normal formula (target up and up blue stuff)  to thr gentle formula (purple target up and up brand). I don't think it's made any difference, maybe more difficult to burp now and his poop is usually dark green and smooth. He is always gassy. Arches his back when he is gassy. Yet besides all this he does sleep well.  We put him in his merlins magic sleep suit and in the swing for 10 mins and then transfer him to the pack n play and he is usually out for 4-6 hours
Doctor gave us some reflux medication that we can use if we want but I'd like to fix this with out medication if possible. I think he has more of a gas issue than reflux, but I'm not a doctor. His doctor also said we can try alimentum formula but I haven't yet. He seems to process normal formula into seedy poop(until the switch to gentle formula). Doctor says he should out grow it eventually. These last 11 weeks have gone by very slow. And I feel bad that I cant bond with my 27 month old son as I'm usually dealing with baby. 
When he spits up he doesn't cry or anything, just a ""happy spitter"" as I've seen the internet call it. 
He doesn't like to nap much, occasionally he'll nap for half the day but other than that it's 15 mins here or 20 mins there.
Anyone have a situation like this? Any words of advice ?  Has anyone had their daycare not take their colicky baby?"
muzakx	2021-04-19 23:36:18+00:00	Wife pierced our 6mo daughter's ears.	"We're Hispanic and it's a cultural thing to pierce young girl's ears. Now that I have a daughter, it's something that I don't like the idea of. She is an infant and has no say in the matter. Not to mention she's a baby! Why does she need her ears pierced? Let's let her decide when she's older.

I voiced my concern to my wife, told her she could do it if that's what she wants to do, but she should know that I'm not comfortable with doing it.

Well she pierced our daughter's ears and I feel genuinely sad that she went through with it. I let her know how I felt and she's now upset with me.

I'm the dad, and maybe I'm only seeing things from the male perspective. So, am I being irrational?

For context, this is our first child."
xbluedog	2021-04-19 23:17:08+00:00	Trans parenting question	"So, my daughter, 15 years old, wants to have a sleepover. Couple friends. One is a trans-boy. However, my daughters friend hasn’t gone through any kind of hormone therapy. 

Rule in my house is “No boys. Period.” Parties or study time, no big deal. However, sleepovers are another matter. I should also qualify that my daughter has declared herself to be pan-sexual. Therefore, the idea that sexual shenanigans could happen is not out of the realm of possibilities. 

After all, if we’re talking about equal treatment and truly recognizing that trans boys are in fact boys, how can I justify breaking that rule? And these friends are also under my supervision and custody. I have a responsibility to all of them while they’re in my care, not just my daughter."

I was sexually assaulted seven years ago and am not comfortable with any male seeing me naked (other than my husband). I asked my female obgyn today about my options for not having a male present and her response felt... Judgemental. The sexual assault is in my file bc I was diagnosed with depression and ptsd as a result, but I've never spoken with her personally about the assault. She said ""maybe you could schedule an appointment with our male doctor's so you could get to know them better."" But I don't want to get to know them - I asked her to just not have any male doctor's there. Then she told me the best she could do is schedule an induction because ""it's not like we have a backup team of people."" It felt like she was a bit judging me for asking for this. But also why is it so normalized that I would automatically be comfortable with a male doctor seeing me in THE most vulnerable position of my life? 

Am I being ridiculous for making this request??"
badgerclark	2021-04-19 22:42:57+00:00	My son might be kicked out of daycare for biting. Advice?	"Title says it all. My son (almost 2) broke a kids skin at daycare by biting him. He bit someone last week, but didn’t break skin. He gets two more chances and I am almost certain he could be kicked out this week if he doesn’t chill out.

At home he bites. We have been doing timeout, scolding, etc... We have been trying for three months to get him to stop biting us. The plus side was he didn’t do it at daycare. They have had nothing but glowing things to say about him. He got tubes last week so his ears are still healing and we think that’s the cause for lashing out at daycare, but he has a temper as well.

At home if he gets told “no” on something he tries to take it out on his big brother. Doesn’t matter if his brother is involved or not: if he gets upset he seems to cope by biting us or his brother. We don’t know where this is coming from. He’s not teething. He’s a sweet kid 80% of the time, full of smiles and very giggly, but holy crap, the other 20% he is full of anger. We like this daycare (great teachers and learning plan) and really don’t wanna see him get kicked out. Anyone have advice? Is this maybe psychological?"

This has been a major challenge for both me and my wife. We assume our son (turning 3 this summer) has built up this habit from daycare with other kids. It pains us to see even the most harmless moment, he becomes mean.

Like when we teach him to wash hands with soap (you try to wash your soapy hands together with him) and he uses the back of his head or he uses his arm to shove you away.

What's a good method to teach the toddler to share?

cubredx	2021-04-19 22:02:14+00:00	How to teach my daughter to be respectful of other's property?	"I have a massive pet peeve of kids going on stranger's property. I don't care if they're ""just"" cutting through, riding their bikes, or whatever else. Unless they have explicit permission from the homeowner, it's trespassing and disrespectful. And some of you might thing I just sound like a bitter old bag, but I know there are plenty of others who feel the same. It just gets old having your space violated by some rando kid who has no right to be there, but I digress.

Few of the other parents in my town seem concerned with teaching their kids to respect other people's property, so it concerns me that as my daughter approaches an age where she'll be allowed to venture out on her own or with friends a little bit, she's gonna fall into the same behavior.

The problem is, I'm not sure how to pound this into her head in 9-year-old terms. I don't remember what/how I was taught. I don't know if the reasoning about respecting and being considerate to people and their property. Obviously when she was a bit younger and we'd be out on walks I'd remind her to stay on the sidewalk/street, and she does when we're out now, but I don't know if she will when she's alone or with friends.

So, how do you go about this sort of thing? It's not exactly something I'll probably find out about if she disobeys or punish her for."
Pawsywawsy3	2021-04-19 21:42:31+00:00	4 Year Old Won’t Use the Bathroom at School	"We have a problem with our 4 year old who refuses to use the bathroom at school.  His teacher has been wonderful and is trying to help us but he only goes in the restroom but won’t pee. He says he can’t go. This is for a stretch of 6 hours.  We have tried to figure out if he’s scared of something, or some other reason and we’re clueless.  He holds it until he bursts (either at the end of the school day he has an accident or as soon as she gets home). 

We have no idea how to solve this other than his teacher waiting and listening to whether or not he goes, which is not reasonable and not something I would ask the teacher.  What is something we can do to help him go at school?"
raggedyange77	2021-04-19 21:33:49+00:00	Teenagers and sex. A parenting dilemma	"My husband and I have a great relationship with our 16.5 year old son. We pride ourselves on our ability to communicate openly and honestly. So when he came to us recently and announced he and his girlfriend had begun sleeping together, we picked our jaws up off the floor, gave him a hug and said ‘thanks for trusting us with that information’... Then we both freaked out behind closed doors later that night.

We continue to freak out(quietly and a long way away from him). Although both our son and his girlfriend are legally of consenting age, our son is quite emotionally immature and very forgetful! In a later conversation, I asked if his girlfriend was taking contraceptives. He replied no, because of a pre-existing liver condition she can’t. He assured me they were having protected sex. It’s a disaster waiting to happen.

My husband feels that we should speak to the girlfriend’s mother but I’m very reluctant. She doesn’t have a great relationship with her parents and is open about this. She is of legal, consenting age and I don’t feel it’s my place to ‘out’ her to her parents.

By the same token, it doesn’t really feel like my place to open a discussion with her myself either. I’m not her Mum. I’m her boyfriend’s Mum. How awkward if I just start chatting to her about her sex life with my son 😳

On the flip side, an unplanned pregnancy for these two would be disastrous for their futures. So I’m a bit stumped as to what to do to help my son and his girlfriend navigate this new world they’ve entered. 

I feel he told us because he was inviting guidance. I’ve tried to impress on him the importance of controlling his DNA. I’ve told him ‘once you give it away, there are no take backsies and you may not have any control over what happens next. So be very protective and discerning with who you give it to and when’. He told me he understands. My concern is, accidents happen."
Skunkinthetrunk2	2021-04-19 21:30:06+00:00	Ways to help with emotional regulation	"I'm looking for ways to help a 6 year old with emotional regulation. I'm starting to suspect adhd (runs in the family). He has very strong reactions to minor corrections and he runs away to his room. I have never sent him to his room for inappropriate behavior. He will also hide if he's uncomfortable and doesn't like people who press him to open up (he shuts down). He does better with people who allow him space to get comfortable and engage on his own terms. He's fine with familiar adults. 

He's quiet, observant, intelligent, and sensitive. I also worry about his ability to assert himself with peers, from what I've observed from a distance he shuts down and/or runs away. He however, has no issue hitting his twin while at home.

We role play; discuss things he can say to assert himself; practice appropriate ways to say hello to someone new.

Any tips, tricks, website are greatly appreciated."

ladydaniel	2021-04-19 20:55:41+00:00	Child gets sick everytime we meet other kids...	"The title unfortunately isn't really an exaggeration. My son is 4, and hopefullt going to start school in the fall. But we've noticed everytime we take him somewhere with other kids he has a cold the next day. It never fails. Playground, cold. Zoo, cold. Playdate, cold. We got rid of a children's museum membership because he kept getting sick when he went and we were concerned it was because they weren't cleaning properly. Nope, not the issue.


The weird part is he's fine around adults. We visited family recently and didn't have any issues from being on a crowded airplane. But we went to a playground yesterday and by the time he was ready for bed he was sniffling. 


I know the issue is because he's never been in daycare and the last year quarantining has only made it worse. His immune system isn't as strong because he hasn't been around a lot of other germy kids. I know the answer is to slowly get him out more often. But it feels like a vicious cycle of going out, getting sick for a few days, then going out and getting sick again. I'm very concerned about what will happen once he starts school. 

Anyone got any advice?"

Clearly we have not had a full on sex talk but he does know some/most anatomy of males and females. I’ve told him to make a baby the sperm for a male and egg from the female have to meet. But now how they get to the same place.

But seriously guys, wtf do I tell him?  Everyone always says “talk to them in an age appropriate way.” Guess what fellow parents, I don’t know what that means! Does anyone have any good book recommendations or advice about this kind of stuff? We’ve had other body talks with him but this is one of those conversations that I haven’t been looking forward too.

Our pediatrician said she should be only taking 2 naps soon but she routinely seems to need 3 naps. I watch for sleepy cues and find that she will get fussy and overtired if she’s up longer than 2-2.5hrs.

StillWill	2021-04-19 20:30:41+00:00	"Trying to pick a day care for the fall, Montessori vs Chesterbrook Academy"	"When I go back to work at the end of the summer (teacher), we will send our son to day care. He will be 18 months then. His grandparents have been watching him during the week for the past year. He will likely go to day care 3 days a week and his grandparents will watch him 2 days a week.

Everything about Montessori seems great, but it is crazy expensive and I have no idea if it is right for my son. He is very, very active and loves to move around constantly, picking things up, dragging things, getting into things. He's very curious and it is wonderful, but I don't know what kind of environment is best for him. He is very social and warms up to people and kids quickly, and loves being around others. 

We have also looked at Chesterbrook Academy, which is half the cost. Kind of hard to explain, but even though I know they are both businesses, Chesterbrook feels more like a business than a school. 

It's not like Montessori is even a bit more expensive, it's ridiculously more expensive:

Montessori: about 2k a month

Chesterbrook: about 1k a month (with a 10% teacher discount, not discount with Montessori).

Like I said, I love the idea of Montessori and my son being super independent and self-sufficient, but I don't know if it's really worth spending that much money or if it fits my son's personality. I'm not sure if he would thrive with limited structure or if he needs it - hard to tell, he's 14 months old!!

Any input would be helpful!"

"My step-daughter (13) is becoming a huge Miley Cyrus fan, which I'd be okay with, but she's particularly obsessed with her 2013 VMA performance era, which I had to deal with as my son had a giant crush on her. It was easier then because I could relate to it, but I can't help but feel a bit uncomfortable  when it comes to wearing barely anything to school and making ""twerking videos"" in public, and I think it's reasonable for me to have some sort of discomfort with that. Any time I express this to my wife (which is very little) she gives off a vibe as though I'm weird for even bringing it up. I would never discipline her for having an obsession with a celebrity, but am I wrong for not thinking she was the most positive role model at the time? Especially since Miley has had so many other phases, I wish she could look up to her in different ways rather than the attention grabbing ways. Maybe this should go to AITA but I wanted more of a parents' perspective."

I see so many people that got dogs once lockdown started lifting but we were still in store for who knows how long. Not us! Went to a pet store and wanted to get a fish. They wouldn’t let us get a fish without already having a tank at home and even though they had tanks crammed with fish, would only sell one per 5gal tank. Whatever. Walking out, my daughter got distracted by MICE. I got outvoted and we got a damn mouse. We have 3 cats, ffs. 

It’s been about a year. I like her. She’s cute. She’s sweet. She runs in her ball when we take her out and aside from her pee smelling like absolute nuclear acid, I like her. 

The other day, my husband went to get pet supplies while my daughter was at school. He got some new treats for the mouse. I heard a noise and thought it was her on her wheel, but sounded VERY loud. She’s in a room that’s locked, and so we knew that the cats didn’t knock anything over there, but thought we’d go down and give her new treats. 

I opened the door..... she was gone. Like, cage open, yet up on a surface where there was unlikely she could get down safely, and SURELY, would NEVER be able to get back up. I called for my husband. He was the last to see her, 12 hours ago. Well, shit. Like she’s in a huge room, lots of nooks and crannies. We felt all over the cage. Nothing. Did a cat get her? Did she run to some odd corner? We were actually calm. Got flashlights and just hoped we could either find her before school was over or think of what we would tell our daughter. I was leaning towards the latter, to be honest. 

After about 10 mins with no luck, I got up from under a storage table (which we took everything out of) to go look somewhere else. I happen to look at the open cage... and there’s this little perfect white mouse with a grin looking back at me through the still-completely open door. My husband and I confirmed with each other, we both felt around for her. Everywhere in the cage. 

I don’t know what happened. But I have never been so glad to see a mouse in my house."

But really, why does it seem like thinking about or actually having a third kid is so horrible? My husband and I currently have two girls (1 and 4) and we're discussing if we want a third or not. When I look this topic up online or on Reddit, it feels like all the posts are so negative about the topic! How you'll have no time for yourself, life isn't designed for a family of 5 (travel, tables at a restaurant, etc), or the whole zone defense vs man-on-man argument. I've also read articles that talk about parents of 3 being more stressed than parents of 4. 

I totally get that life will be crazier with more kids, but is 3 really that bad of a number?! What am I missing? I will say my biggest concern is finances because obviously having an additional kid will cost more but is it that much more that I wouldn't have the kid?! I don't think so. But that's also why I'm here, writing this post. 

I would love to hear from parents of 3 about how it really is. Surely there must be positives to having 3 kids?!"
EarthArtistic4838	2021-04-19 19:02:36+00:00	Went to the ER yesterday and I’m feeling like the worst mom of the year	"This weekend me (25f) and my daughter (6) house sat for my mom. It was really nice. It was just us and we were having fun playing games, watch tv, running through the sprinkler, and playing with the dogs. I decided to take a moment and go outside for a smoke. I was gone all of 5 minutes and left the door open so I could at least hear her if I needed. When I came back in she was in a panic. She has a miniature connect four game and for the first time ever she decided to put a piece in her mouth. She was breathing fine everything was fine and at first I thought she full on swallowed it and she would of course later poop it out. But then she drops the bombshell on me. She can feel it stuck in her throat! Man, I’ve never driven to the hospital so fast in my life. It was stuck in her esophagus. While she could breathe just fine and wasn’t in any sort of immediate danger, at the time I didn’t know where this tint flat and round object was. We had X-rays taken, she was COVERED in drool because it was literally impossible for her to swallow, she was scared, I was scared it was a mess. 

At the end of the day everything was fine. It dislodged and she was left with a sore throat and a popsicle to get some fluids into her since it had been 3 hours at this point, but I feel like an absolute terrible mom for letting it happen. I threw out all of my cigarettes and anything else that would require me to take my eyes off her. I haven’t left her alone since it happened. Maybe I’m over reacting. But man I was just so scared. All I wanted was a couple moments to breathe. I was outside for less time than it takes me to shower and she’s never been one to put things in her mouth.

Am I over reacting? Should I have done anything different?"
dumplings0up	2021-04-19 18:53:06+00:00	How do parents hang out outside the house at night?	"Hey r/Parenting, I am a new parent to a 4 month old buddle of joy. As a COVID parent, I feel like we've had the luxury of not needing to deal with ""social logistics"" because none of our friends are gathering or hanging out anyway. However, as society starts to open back up again and friends start hanging out, I wonder: how did you deal with hangouts/friend gatherings that happened after your LO's bedtime?

No, I'm not even talking about bars or clubs. I'm saying...let's say your buddy invites you over for board games &amp; beer, and that starts at 7 PM (pretty reasonable time). But, your 4-month old's night time routine begins at 7:30 PM. After baby's asleep, you prooobably shouldn't be leaving him/her alone in your house.... yea?

So what did people do in non-COVID times with social gatherings &amp; hangouts, especially if they collide with your baby's bedtime? Did you just feel comfortable leaving baby alone at home after he/she's asleep? Did you need to hire a nanny every time? (And if you do, do you need to teach the nanny your LO's night time routine?) Did you just never hang out with friends unless it was in the morning or afternoon?

Both kids were moved from our room to their own rooms by 4 months and they’re in bed by 7 without a fight everyday. My husband and I have always had time to be intimate and our house really is never that messy. The kids put their toys away and listen when we’re in public. They’re not picky eaters, they rarely have toddler tantrums. Even as infants I never felt exhausted from feedings or anything and transitioning from breast to bottle to formula wasn’t really that daunting either. They potty trained at 18 months and shortly after that were night trained to. 
They help with chores, they put away their dishes, they help with laundry. They never have an issue giving up electronics. 
I dont know maybe I’ll pay for it when they’re teenagers but right now I just can’t relate? Has anybody else gone through this? I know it’s weird but I almost feel alone in having overall just “good” kids. 

yeah we have had a few bumps but really so far it’s been pretty easy 
and please don’t come at me. I’m in a few toddler and baby group chats for their ages and I never have anything bad to share and I feel awkward chiming in just in general 
I just don’t get the struggle"

She screams and cries even if we’re at home. I assure her I’m here and love her etc, but does anyone have any go to phrases or solutions that worked for you?"
Lizclaire29	2021-04-19 18:41:21+00:00	2 year old with sensory processing disorder	"My daughter just turned two and I’m fairly certain she has sensory processing disorder. She has had sensory issues ever since she was a baby - hated going in the car seat, getting her nails trimmed, taking baths, the textures of certain foods. As she’s gotten older her sensory issues have intensified. She refuses to sit down in the bathtub because she doesn’t like the feeling of water and hates when I wash her hair. She won’t wear jeans, protests socks, and she doesn’t let us put her hair up. She doesn’t struggle with loud noises (mostly) and she likes being at busy playgrounds etc, but she has full blown meltdowns whenever we transition from one activity to another. From what I’ve seen, her tantrums seem more intense than most kids’ and are definitely more frequent. 

She’s incredibly verbal for her age, has great fine motor, is extremely social (although shy at first), and her doctor has ruled out autism. He mentioned that it’s worth getting an OT eval but that insurance likely wouldn’t cover services since her issues aren’t pronounced enough to be considered medically necessary. He also said it could be worth it to pay for some OT sessions out of pocket.

I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and what the outcome was — did you explore OT services? Did your child grow out of this phase? Were there other resources and strategies you found useful? 

I don’t want to ignore something that could be an actual problem, but I also don’t want to overreact."

Delivery-More	2021-04-19 18:22:25+00:00	Morning Routine Blowups	"My husband (38m) and I (36f) have two children: Arthur (3m) and Kate (18 months f)

Both my husband and I work form home, so we have been sending our son to preschool M-F since the beginning of March. Once he is there, he loves it and comes home happy and talking about his day. But mornings have always been difficult. Both my son and husband take forever to get out of bed. He has criticized me in the past for trying to keep to a strict morning routine because he can understand how tough it is for our son to get out of bed.

Here is what I (try) to do in rough time estimates:   
6:00am - I gently rub my sons back to begin waking him.   
6:05am - I turn on the light, trying to rouse him again.  
6:15am - If he is still not awake, I coax him to the livingroom to drink some milk and eat a granola/fruit bar (in case he isn't able to get out of the house on time).  
6:20am - Potty  
6:30am - Getting dressed; I offer two options for shirts and pants/shorts  
6:35am - Brush teeth in livingroom, watching TV to distract him  
6:40am - Finish milk while putting on his shoes, and jacket.  
6:55am - Mask up and out the door by 7am

Meanwhile, I wake my husband several times so that he's ready and out the door by 7am. If he leaves by then, he is able to come back and get to work. I am also able to fix myself up before waking my daughter at 7:30am.

Obviously I would not be here if things went smoothly. Almost every morning, Arthur still refuses to get up, loudly whining that he wants to stay home, that he is ""scared"" of school, and for me to ""go away."" ""Scared"" is his catch-all word for nervous, worried, anxious, even excited. We've talked to him at length about why he is ""scared,"" and it really comes across like he just doesn't like being made to do his schoolwork. I have no reason to believe that he is in any danger (physical or emotional) at the school. 

He gets plenty of sleep. He does not nap during the weekends; he wakes around 6:45am, bedtime is 6:30pm, he's asleep by 8pm. Weekdays, he wakes at about 6:15am, naps for an average of two hours at school, bedtime is 8pm, falls asleep before 9:30pm. 

He has always had trouble calming down. Once he gets in a frenzy, he can get violent, i.e. pushing, yelling at us to ""go away"" or ""no want to,"" throwing things, hitting, kicking, and now spitting. We have tried Time-outs (when he throws things or hurts someone), Time Ins/Calm Down Corner, belly breathing, glitter jars, letting him cry it out, etc. But nothing works!

I feel like this behavior is primarily defiance. He is three. He has fun with Mama and Dada during the weekends. He wants to stay home. So he fights, whines, and tantrums when he doesn't get his way. I try to be patient and give him a little more time. I've tried being enthusiastic and created a ""Morning Routine"" chart, where Daniel Tiger rides Trolley to each task, then give star rewards for completing it on time; extra star for doing it quietly. (I try not to say ""Don't wake up your sister."" since that might cause resentment against Kate.) Often, I end up having to gently force him, giving him chances to comply and calm himself down; I do not yell at him and rarely say anything harsh. I've threatened to just take him to school in his pajamas and ""nighttime undies,"" (nighttime diapers). I'm not sure his school would accept him if I did that.

The big problem is that we want his sister to sleep in until 7:30am. She is used to his antics by now and is really good about staying asleep and quiet. But some days it gets out of hand! My husband has tried to help keep Arthur calm, but his solution is to basically force him through the routine and get him out the door ASAP so as to not wake Kate (never works, imo). He has even accused me of favoritism because I let Arthur loudly whine so much, even though it might wake Kate.

Again, he's three! He's going to cry and whine when he doesn't get his way. But I can't give in when my husband and I both have a time crunch. And he won't go to sleep earlier, even when we move his bedtime.

I'm really at my wit's end! Any further suggestions from the community?

Note: During the weekends, I let Arthur sleep in until 7am at the latest."
dazzcarlos	2021-04-19 18:20:53+00:00	Age of children playing outside alone	"Sorry for the format in advance. So a little context, my kids are 5 and 3, the eldest started school last september and fit straight in (despite all covid restrictions). The past few weeks, kids have been ringing at our door asking if the eldest can go out to play. The half dozen or so kids in question are age 4-9ish. I have refused to let him out yet as my kid has little road sense when hes messing around (which im assuming is normal. But another reason is because i have witnessed these kids playing chicken with cars on our street, and even caught them breaking into gardens and also having proper kicking and fighting matches. This is just the stuff ive witnessed so god knows what else they are upto. But the past 2 nights, one kid has decided to knock on our windows to ask if my kid if he can come out to play. Obviously i said no. But im now questioning myself if its my parenting style being too strict or other parents being too care free. I dont want my kids to be indoor kids but i still dont feel comfortable letting them loose either. And i wouldnt want him teased for being locked in when hes at school. Does anyone have any advice on how to tackle this?"

2. Frozen didn't end a different way this time, that's my fault, I should make different varients of the movie.

TheAnna710	2021-04-19 18:00:56+00:00	"7 weeks, incomplete naps??"	"We currently have a 7 week old and I’m trying to navigate the soon transition out of a swaddle, so we’ve been working on doing naps with the Merlin sleep suit and I just bought a zipadee zip to see if that helps at all. 

Currently, I’ve been following wake windows and have found that he only sleeps about 45-60 min before waking up, however when we go to get him he’s clearly still tired and falls back asleep almost immediately in our arms - but as soon as we go to put him down, he’s awake and fussy and then the cycle begins. He will nap no problem for 2-3 hours if he’s on me or being held, he just seems to hate being in the bassinet or pack and play for sleep. Sometimes he wakes up immediately, sometimes he’s asleep for another 10 minutes but then wakes up. He does better overnight - 3-5 hour chunks, but he’s also fully swaddled still. 

I guess I’m trying to figure out, is this an issue of not being swaddled and him not being able to self soothe quite yet? Should we be trying to put him back down or just call it quits after that first chunk of sleep? 

I’m trying to be patient and not rush things but I also want to get on a semblance of a routine. I just feel like I haven’t figured out that magic thing that’s going to click yet. 

Any advice or feedback would be super duper appreciated!"
thegreatbeardman	2021-04-19 17:48:43+00:00	Picky &amp; Stubborn Eater - Who has solved this? 9yr old	"Been working on this one for awhile, here is what we got going on.

9 year old kid. 

Eats breakfast, no issues. Eats plain cheerios w/ milk, omelettes with nothing added, cheesy scrambled eggs, toast, almost any fruit is on the table. 

Eats lunch, no issues. Usually PB sandwiches, fruit, crackers, cheese sticks, yogurt. Typical kid stuff. 

Snacks, typically things like pretzels and hummus, more fruit, any sort of cracker / chip / pretezel type things. Also, if its a new snack or candy of any sort, no issue trying it. 

Dinner.... OMG. We only eat these very specific things. We wont try anything else. Not even if its a derivative of something we know we already like.   
1. Arbys roast beef sandwiches (gross) &amp; McDonalds. I don't typically take any of my kids here in the last year or two unless we are on a road trip.   
2. Hotdogs / mac n' cheese  
3. Spaghetti (plain with butter/cheese, red sauce, or pesto)  
4. Target chicken nuggets (I don't buy these either but she'd eat them all up)  
5. Chipotle bowls (rice, red tomato salsa, cheese, some shredded up chicken)

I've tried a number of things, nothing has worked yet.

1. Positive bribery with ice cream, money, no chores, 1x1 time. Nothing works.   
2. Trying to remove any sort of attention getting by not eating or being stubborn. I don't make a big deal trying to eat or not. It's offered every day. And the answer either way is just ""OK"".   
3. No negative attention. We don't talk down about it, she's not in trouble for not eating, etc.   
4. Making all sorts of food out of food that she definitely likes. Like she likes cheese. She likes nacho chips. She likes nachos and cheese. But, make cheesy nacho chips in the oven, gross, wont even try it. Make a chipotle bowl replica with lime rice, tomato salsa, cheese, wont try it. When she was really little, like 3 or 4, if you took her to a place and the french fries where not the square thin strands like McDonalds, heaven forbid waffle cut, or curly, or anything else, she wouldn't try it.   
4. Removed trying to feed her, she eats she eats, she doesn't she doesn't. This is what we are doing right now. If its one of those 5 things above, she'll eat. Otherwise, she'll sit at the table hungry. 

She's my most active kid. She's outside playing with friends non stop almost every second of the day. She plays soccer, and is trying to get into competitive soccer which is going to have her practicing more, running more, being even more active. She's pretty thin, but, not unhealthy (yet), but, she definitely could eat more and would probably help her growth, energy, everything else. I'm getting a little concerned, and at the same time, I don't want us to have to cook 2 different meals every day. 

She wakes up some morning with stomach aches, from not eating... 

Its not like she wont eat some of these things. If I can successfully hide something in food, she'll happily eat it up with no adverse reactions, as I was thinking maybe she has some sort of inert thing that makes her not want it / not feel well. But, so long as she doesn't know, she eats things just fine. 

She is also a very stubborn, strong willed, ""tomboy"", wild, youngest of 3 whose parents got divorced when she was 5-6 years old, who spends a week on and off with her other parent. I sometimes wonder if this has helped create this power dynamic she is currently in as I know it was a very confusing time for her especially. 

We don't have a bad relationship from what I can tell. She loves to hang out and watch tv with us. She wants us at all her soccer games. She has a normal relationship with her sibs. She has a lot of friends in school and in the neighborhood. Does pretty well in school minus 1 subject. 

I don't like the idea of catering to just her for dinner, as her sibs have / do try just about anything we throw at them, and they have even learned that they like vegetables, and new food. I don't want them to feel like she gets special treatment. 

I try to pump up her snacks after school just to get some more food in her to last since I know she'll be saying no most likely. There is no correlation to how much she eats at dinner based on food she gets in the afternoon. But I also don't like having to do this sort of thing either. 

I'm thinking about maybe some counseling / therapy work for her to just see if there is anything going on that she wont talk to me about. Going to reach out to her school as well to see if they got anyone who can also help. But, I'm not sure if any of it would help, she's not exactly open about her feelings until she's officially upset. 

Sigh... anyone got anything that I can try, things to think about, or success stories on how you did it for a similar kid? I'm running out of ideas that are still positive."
nothingsurgent	2021-04-19 17:07:37+00:00	High energy 3.5yo night time routine?	"My 2nd boy has more energy than the rest of the family combined. 

I can’t figure out a way to create a routine for him, and get him to sleep at the same time every day, plus I’m trying to figure out how to help him fall asleep.

The first problem is his ADHD-like behavior. If he’s not EXTREMELY tired (which is rare), he can’t lie down for more than 30 seconds, not to mention keeping his eyes closed, without starting to either talk or get up / play around.

I get impatient after sitting next to him for an hour, and I feel guilty b/c I don’t want to shut him up when he wants to talk to me, or refuse his requests (a toy, water, potty, food - Niall if them just an excuse to escape his boredom). 

Especially I feel bad when he says he’s hungry (although in 9 out of 10 times when I surrender he won’t really eat).

The poor kid can’t turn off his brain.

—— Things I’ve tried ——

- lullabies (helped a little until he was 2.5)
- white noise (helps with distractions from outside the room, but doesn’t solve the problem)
- touch (back rubs/tickles/head massages) - he hates it (other kid lives it and falls asleep in a minute).

 To make things worse: 

It takes so much time to put him down, I start really early.

But some days are just worst, if he’s not absolutely exhausted it can take 2-3 hours. When he’s tired it’ll take 30-60mins.

Lately he’s been getting grumpy and tired around 1PM, so we started a quick nap (30mins). The word thing is sometimes he will still be able to fall asleep by 7pm after a nap, and sometimes he’ll be up until 11PM.

So to sum up:

1. I can’t figure out how to crate a routine that’s consistent.

2. I’m out of ideas of things to do to help him shut down his brain and fall asleep. 

Please help :)"

I have a question that some might find silly, but thank you in advance for any feedback :)

I have a 7 month old son who I was breastfeeding you until 6 month mark. I only stopped because I wanted to get pregnant again but hadn’t started my period yet. I slowly cut back nursing to 1 pump session a day and finally started my period a few weeks ago. I’m still pumping 1x a day and am taking ovulation test strips. 

My question: now that I’ve started my period, can I start amping up my pumping/nursing to get my supply back up for my son or will that interfere with ovulating/trying to get pregnant again? Should I just stick to 1 pump a day? Cut back to nothing? Or can I try to bring my supply back up now that I have my period? I’d like to give my son breastmilk but getting pregnant again is my main priority. 

Thank you!!!"

She isn’t walking yet and so can’t stand independently. She is 95th percentile for weight and apparently heavier babies walk later because they need more strength to carry their body weight. So I can’t yet really change her diapers standing, though I did lean her against the wall one time lol.

SideWinderSyd	2021-04-19 16:16:40+00:00	I am appaled at what some parents allow to happen	"[Recently, I came across this](https://www.reddit.com/r/KidsAreFuckingStupid/comments/mtyba6/toddlers_wake_up_and_choose_violence_every_day/). I am shocked that this was allowed to happen.  The older child seems to have been trained precision in that throwing move.  

&amp;#x200B;

And that's not bad in itself, but allowing him to throw things at his younger sibling is just wrong.  It's evident that he's done it before and whoever was there had the audacity to film it and allow it it happen?   Accidents happen, but that was not an accident.  It was a calculated and practised move.

&amp;#x200B;

I would have stopped it from happening the first time.  Sure, a good aim is a nice skill, but a rule we have in our house is to never  throw things at another sibling, parent, friend, human or pet.  So it might be something harmless this time, but what next?  A sharp rock?  A paperweight?  A knife?   Siblings are not targets.  

&amp;#x200B;

Am I just getting too old for this generation?  All the Reddit repiles seem to be cheering the kid on.  I would cheer as well if he was throwing it at a  batter on the field, but  not when the other sibling is young, unprepared and defenseless."
toastfactory	2021-04-19 16:01:52+00:00	14 Year Old Son Struggling to Return to Normal Life	"I live in one of the most covid-cautious parts of the US. My kids just went back to in-person school two weeks ago.

My 12 year old seems to be doing all right, but my 14 year old is not. In the Before Times, he was a strong student who had a solid handful of friends. He wouldn't exactly be *thrilled* to see Monday morning roll around, but who is? He had the usual ups and downs for his age, but things were basically okay.

But after over a year of being at home sitting in front of the computer, this is a different kid. Every school morning is a slog. He doesn't want to go back, when he is there, doesn't really interact with his peers. Not that he enjoyed online learning at all, in fact he struggled with it quite a bit and complained about it a lot. But, being around people again is somehow even worse for him.

He was a mildly anxious kid before covid, which wasn't the end of the world - his dad has anxiety and depression, and we were able to help him cope. But now most days he tells me he is having panic attacks. (His teachers do not see this so they aren't severe, but I believe he is feeling something.) He goes to a tiny private school where everyone knows who he is and he gets tons of leeway and kindness from his teachers - it's a pretty sheltered environment. There's not really any calmer, gentler way to get back out into the world. And still, it's not going well.

We're getting him back into counseling, but in the meantime...I'm at a loss as to how I should be handling this as a parent. I'm scared that we're starting down a path where he never really adjusts back to the world. If he can't manage in his tiny private middle school where he has always been very comfortable, how is he going to handle high school in the fall?! So my instinct is to push him out of his comfort zone. But my husband is inclined to be more indulgent and just let him stay home. 

I just...don't believe the child is going to magically adjust back to the world if we don't push. He doesn't have to become a social butterfly, it's 100% fine if he prefers to be home, but he needs to be able to function out there. But my husband is the one who has personal experience with anxiety, so maybe I'm out of my lane. I don't want to ask for unreasonable things and make him resent me. I also don't want him on reddit in 10 years posting that he wished his parents had pushed him harder, you know?

Anyone else having this, or is mine the only kid that is not bounding enthusiastically into post-covid life?"

BocceBurger	2021-04-19 15:47:44+00:00	How do you feel about paying kids for grades?	"When I was a kid my best friend got paid for her grades. This was in the 90s, and she got $20 for an A and $10 for a B, no money for C or below. This applied only to her 5 main subjects but that meant that she could earn $100 per quarter. I was JEALOUS. I asked my mom if she'd pay me for good grades and she laughed right in my face. I was a bad student, got terrible grades, always had, and I didn't improve. I feel like I'd really have been motivated to get good grades by this money incentive! The way I see it, we get paid for our work as adults. We get a bonus if we do something extra well. This is kind of like that, right? (I'm self employed and get no bonus or raise at all, but generally speaking...)

I ask this because specifically my child is struggling to memorize her times tables and it is causing her to fall behind at school. I have a math worksheet I want her to complete every day after school and I was considering paying her $1 per sheet so she'd be excited to do it, rather than me forcing her and there being tears every day. Is this crazy? I remember my mom laughing at me and it's making me wonder if I'm way out of line with my reasoning here..."

My son almost died in 2019. His body basically stopped making blood, so he was out of class a year before even COVID. 

So during this pandemic, they started doing school from home and my wife and I started working from home. A blessing that we get to do that, for sure, but trying to get my job done while trying to get a 3rd, 5th and 7th grader through school, to be quite honest it's been a fruitless endeavor. Two out of the three have ADHD, my youngest has ADHD and dyslexia, and I have adhd, ADD and dyslexia. Also... I'm literally not a teacher. And none of us are good at doing all this from home. I prefer to be in the office and they haven't been in a classroom in over a year.

Also, the house we live in, the house I bought before getting married, is just too small.

So academically, my son is very far behind. Like...really bad. He'll be in 8th grade next year and he hasn't been in a classroom since the beginning of 6th grade. He's regressed in almost every way. He's also REALLY small, so looking at him you would think he's still a 9-10 year old.

My oldest daughter has developed severe depression and isn't handling it well. Academically not as bad, but not good. 

My youngest, well she's a firecracker lunatic and though she doesn't really have a whole lot of homework and doesn't really take tests, just the sheer comprehension of things is way behind. Personality wise I don't think she's been affected at all, she's still silly and hilarious.

On top of all that, they've all turned into complete disorganized slobs. Partly because that's kind of how the mother is, but still.

With all that said, it's all coming to an end. 

They're going to be back in school next school year, and my son is doing in class summer school starting in June.

My wife and I just started house hunting, and we're fixing this place up to sell. We're able to afford a much bigger house than we thought, and we're going to sell this place for a lot more and I thought we were going to be able to. As far as I know, my wife and I are going to be working from home permanently, so I'll build myself a nice little office and be good.

So I started thinking of the next house, as the next life. A truly next chapter. What I call ""Life 2.0"".

I have a lot about myself I have to fix, and directions I want to take my life and career. But I know how to go about that. I'm not sure what to do with the kids. 

I'm not totally sure with what to do about his immaturity, about her depression and the littlest ones academics. My wife and I are sitting down, making our plans and trying to paint that picture, but I have to admit I feel a little lost. Especially hard considering the custody agreement, week on week off.

So, looking to other parents whose kids have gone through a hard time, and how you pulled them back. How you fixed the damage of really bad years.

Thank you all"

1) a stroller travel system with car seat built in
2) light stroller, and a separate car seat
3) light stroller, but rent car seats at destination (seems really expensive and risky)

We're leaning towards option 1. I think we want to have a good, light stroller to use at our destination since it will be for several months. Another option we found is the Mountain Buggy Nano V2 which is a light and compact stroller, but it also includes some straps to attach ANY car seat to it. So it's kind of the best of both worlds.

How did you do it and what would you recommend? Specific models are also appreciated! To note we have a Chicco Keyfit 30  car seat."

She's recently  started hanging out with another girl in our neighborhood that hasn't  been a great influence on her. She used to always be home by the time I  told her to but now I usually end up having to text/call her when she  doesn't show up and even then it still takes her another 20 minutes to  walk back home from the park that's like 3 minutes away. I don't think  the other girl is a bad kid necessarily but she seems to be giving her  bad habits. I don't want to make her stop hanging out with a friend but  I'm not sure what my other options are. TBH it's just nice she's  spending time outside because that seems like something hardly any kids  are doing anymore since they're all attached to their screens.

The past month or so, it has all changed. Every step of the morning routine is met with resistance. When we arrive at day care, she doesn't want to get out of the car, and it ends up with me physically handing her over while having a meltdown every morning.

Nothing has changed at the daycare, same teachers, same friends and she loves being there (they send pictures of her happily playing 5 minutes after these meltdowns). Nothing has changed at home except that we finally ditched the pacifier, but that was about 6 weeks ago (not sure it's related as she never used them at daycare). Even the day care asked me what is going on because this never happened before...

We have tried time outs for not listening/cooperating, we have tried a visual chart with the morning routine, we have tried remaining calm and waiting her out, we have tried telling her we are not happy with how she is behaving and not listening. Nothing has stuck, and its just a battle every day. We have tried countless talks about why she is doing this, all she ever says is that she wants to stay home with us which is not possible as we both work. Any ideas on what we can do to get out of this pattern? Its wearing us both out."

When I keep her home with me we push through with no nap and while she can seem cranky as a result, she goes down no problems around 7pm. She wakes up rested and pleasant the next day. 
Anyone else experience this? I’ve asked the daycare teachers and they say there is no expectation for her to sleep but she does have to be quiet. Should I be looking for a new daycare? We’ve tried everything to get her tired out on the days she naps but nothing works."

StuckInAPinetree	2021-04-19 13:27:03+00:00	5 year old grieving divorce + mom guilt	"Hey everyone

I’m hoping this is okay to post here. My ex-husband and I finalized our divorce last November after having a *very* unhealthy + unhappy marriage the last few years. It has been so hard on our 5 year old daughter. 

She has a lot of trouble like expressing her emotions- she isn’t violent or aggressive but she cries so easily and cries over the smallest things. It was her birthday recently and she wished that “mommy, daddy and I would hang out together again.” 😭 

I have looked into counseling for her but is there anything else divorced/co-parenting parents can offer for advice? 

Everyone keeps saying kids are resilient and she’ll move through this but honestly, that isn’t helping her right now. 

Is there anything you did to help your kids? Any conversation starters that helped? Books? Movies? 

It’s so hard because my ex-husband continues to blame me for giving up on our marriage and “abandoning him”, he places so much blame on me and blame on me for her having a hard time. It’s literally unbearable to think that I am the reason that she is unhappy. I feel incredibly guilty and just like selfish. Maybe I should have just stayed in my unhappy marriage so that she would have had an easier time. Did I completely fuck her up by trying to get out and get my own mental health and well-being straightened out? 

So much word vomit for this post. And I’m sorry about that. I just don’t know what to do, how to help her get through this thing that I inflicted on her. 😭"

idowithkozlowski	2021-04-19 13:00:03+00:00	Husband possible shift change	"
I currently work 6:30am-3:30pm, Monday-Friday. 

As of now my last day of work will be June 30th, I’ll be 37 weeks pregnant and will be a SAHM once baby girl is here. 

My husband currently works night shift. Current schedule looks like this 

Monday- home at 9am, leaves at 11pm
Tuesday- home at 9am, leaves at 11pm
Wednesday- home at 9am, leaves at 11pm
Thursday- home at 9am, leaves at 11pm 
Friday- home at 9am, off
Saturday- off 
Sunday- leaves at 11pm 

Now there’s a possibility of him switching to mid shift. 2 week day shifts and 2 weekend shifts. His schedule would be like this 

Monday-  “off”
Tuesday- leave at 3pm, home at 1am Wednesday 
Wednesday- leave at 3pm, home at 1 am Thursday 
Thursday- “off”
Friday- off 
Saturday- leave at 11am, home at 1 am Sunday 
Sunday- leave at 11am, home at 1 am Monday. 

Which of these two shifts would you prefer your SO bad if you didn’t work? 

I think Mid shift would be better because he’ll actually get sleep. He could get home at 1am and sleep till 8 or 9, which is more then he sleeps now. Right now he’s barely getting 4-5 hours of sleep. 

I’m having a difficult time with the idea of him working weekends, even though I’d be staying home so the day itself shouldn’t matter. 

But then theres the thought of, should I quit my job earlier if he switches? If he were to switch before june, we wouldn’t see each other at all other then mondays, thursdays and Friday’s after 3pm. 

Can anyone think of pros vs cons to these shifts?"

It's a long journey and it's not exactly an occasion I want to bring my kids to. The flights in and out are sparse at the moment, for obvious reasons, so I would end up away from my kids for a full week. My in laws are going to 'bubble' with us for the duration as my husband can't get a full week off work (he's a teacher) They are great and my husband and I trust them 100% but our daughter has never met them (again, for obvious reasons)

My 4 year old son will likely be fine as he will be in preschool for most of it. I have talked to him in advance and told him I have to go to away for a bit but that I will be back and I will see him on Skype etc. I'm more worried about my 4 month old daughter. Will she forget me? Will our bond be ruined? She will have her Daddy in the evenings but she has never been away from me. 

Has anyone gone away for this sort of length of time leaving a baby so young? Does anyone have any tips (or just kind words to assuage my guilt?) I'd never take this sort of trip if I didnt need to. I don't want to miss my Granny's funeral."

2. Wait 11 years. 
3. Notice she has outgrown every single thing worn last summer. 
4. Take her shopping for her first bras during a pandemic when dressing rooms are closed.
5. Realize that clothing manufacturers have managed to create no less than half a dozen sizes that may fit your 5’2 11 year old. Is she a “girls” size 14? 16? Maybe she is a 16 slim or a 14 tall? 
Or is she a “juniors” size 11, 13, 15?
Maybe she’s a women’s xs? Or Small? What if the top is a ‘slim’ or ‘fitted’ cut.
Why is *every* pair somehow “high-rise” shorts? Does she need a 3.5, 4 or 5 inch inseam? 
6. Throw up your hands in the middle of the third store and just buy one of everything knowing you’ll return 7/8 of it later... I guess closing all the fitting rooms was pretty pointless. 
7. Arrive home to find that she is in fact a girls 14/16 AND a women’s small *except* when she is a women’s extra small. Discover that none of the shorts work, regardless of inseam length. 
8. Buy your tween an ice cream for surviving the whole ordeal and not getting frustrated once, even when you asked her to try on a bra over her shirt in full view of all shoppers. 
9. Hear “This was so fun!! You’re the best, mom!”


Mission accomplished?"

He loves to draw so I figured comics would be a good starting point since it's more picture than writing, but he isn't even interested in reading that. 
I am hoping my fellow book worms would be able to help out. What is one book or series that got you into reading? I can't really recall if there is a book or series that got me into reading but I LOVE reading.

Getting him to read is a lot easier than getting him to write. He will have a meltdown if you ask him to write. He will spend most of his time drawing instead. He has a huge imagination and he can draw a picture and have a massive back story to it, but getting him to write it down or even do math word problems is like pulling teeth. He has no problem typing (since the kids are all doing online learning here) and actually prefers it to writing. Do I just let it happen and I guess go with the times, and let him ""write"" using the computer?

TheRuinedAge	2021-04-19 10:23:55+00:00	How to further help my overweight 12 year old daughter.	"Hello everyone, I need to start this conversation off by saying that my husband and I have already done everything we can aside from therapy, ( Which is our final step. We are uninsured and it would be very expensive.) to educate, and provide healthy alternative choices to our daughter. 

My husband and I are active and athletic, we work out together regularly. I work out at home and we also go to the gym. During the spring and summer we enjoy going roller skating, hiking, going to the park and playing frisbee, you get the idea.

Unfortunately our daughter has zero interest in these things anymore. We have brought her with us and she will try these activities with us for a short amount of time then decide she hates all of it. We try and do things as a family and make it fun! We made a whole day of taking her to a roller skate shop, getting her fitted for a snazzy pair of skates then to the park where she tried it for 5 seconds and hated every second. This continues for everything else really. 
We have also invested in an elliptical, stationary bike, and water tower for our home. Unfortunately she never usex any of it. 
The only thing she seems to enjoy anymore since she became a tween is being on her computer, or playing video games. All the time. This really manifested when Covid hit and she became home schooled.We plan to have her registered for regular school when she gets vaccinated. 

We have taught her healthy eating habits, appropriate portion sizes, how to read nutrition labels, and the importance of staying hydrated her whole life. We rarely keep junk food in the house, and we don't eat fast food very often, that's a treat. 

For dinners I cook a protein, various vegetables, and a healthy carb. They are wholesome, filling, and delicious.
We also keep a stock of various foods that are also healthy choices such as popcorns, yogurts, granola, oats, vegetables, fruits, salads, quality sandwich items, and pre cooked proteins. 

However it seems our daughter will often eat too much of it, or choose not to eat, then eat in the middle of the night after we go to bed. She often swears she doesn't do this but we have caught her many times. We remind her that these behaviors are why she is gaining weight in the first place but she simply continues. 
By now I'm sure you are thinking, "" Maybe this is simply who she wants to be."", And sure if our daughter chooses to be overweight then that is her choice. We wouldn't say anything more about it. 
But the problem is that she is extremely depressed about how she looks and absolutely hates herself. 
She has expressed extreme anxiety about going back to in person school, and doesn't like going outside because of how ashamed she is. 
Getting her updated on immunizations is a hard time for her because she is worried that doctors and nurses will comment on her weight. 

She came to my husband and I in tears based on her perception of herself. It was the single hardest thing to hear coming from her. Even with all the education and resources that we have offered her nothing seems to be working. We even recently adopted an energetic dog to hopefully initiate a new incentive towards being active, but most importantly offer new companionship, help with depression, and healthy responsibility.. But she  hardly interacts with him and simply shits herself away in her room for pretty much the whole day, on her computer. 

We can no longer gently remind her that her behaviors are a direct result of the effort she puts in. Or remind her that over eating at 3am is self sabotaging. She will lash out and tell us that she is tired of hearing the same thing from everyone around her and that we are not helping her, then shut herself away for a few days and avoid us. 

She refuses to work out at all and I have offered many incentives. She has also asked me to remind her to do so. She simply will do nothing for herself."

Keep a list!  Use the notes app or Google Keep to document milestones with your first - tooth at 8 months, pulling up at 9 months, etc.  If you have a second your pediatrician will ask you about your first's timeline to get a frame of reference for your second and like...I don't know - I have Hot Wheels in my purse, my 3 year old sneezed in my pocket, and the baby got poop in my hair.  

You think you'll never forget any of these precious moments, but it goes super fast and from a logistic perspective it wouldn't hurt to keep a running list.  Of course, journal and send your little one emails for them to check in the future or whatever for sentimentality's sake, but having a quick and easily accessible reference might not be a bad idea!"

MielYuna	2021-04-19 09:45:14+00:00	I hate my son's Pediatric Dermatologist!	"FTM here! My son is 5months old and diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis. We have been visiting the said Derma for 6weeks now and met her for 4times. I know treating eczema if a trial and error thing. What made me hate her is she's making me look bad. That everything I do with him is making things worse.

The first time we visit, she told us all some dos and don'ts.. mentioned that I should dress my baby double because it's colder for babies than adult. Also said avoid the carrier I was using coz it's not cotton. So I did.

2nd visit, told us we shouldn't as it might be too hot for the baby and he could swear that would make his flare ups worse. And to wear sleepsuit so he is covered with ""cottony material"".

3rd visit, LO was in sleepsuit. We waited long so LO fell asleep in my arms. We do not bring him in stroller there coz the clinic is quite small. Told us we shouldn't always carry him. that he should be in the stroller. Not to let the baby sleep in my arms. Not to wear footed sleepsuit as babies grows fast and since it's footed, when he is kicking the cloth will scratch his neck. Thus, flare up.

4th visit, LO was in collared white longsleeves, a cotton pants and shoes. Told us not to wear collar as it might be scratching the neck.

My sons worst flare up is in the neck.. For four visits, it hadn't gotten better. I am developing anxiety in this situation. My mind can't stop thinking that this is my fault, that I'm making things worse. In what way should I dress him? I should iron all his clothes to make sure no bacteria would make things worse. Should I even touch my son?

As of now, LO's eczema on his neck has not gotten better. And I don't want to go back to that doctor again!

Sorry for the long post. I'm just really frustrated.

TL;DR : Pediatric Dermatologist is giving me anxiety by making it seem like everything I do is making things worse."

I don't expect many people to agree with my take on hip-hop/rap music, and as a matter of fact, I expect a lot of push-back, *and that's cool.* In either case, I have to let the First Amendment prevail, so here it goes:

After listening to a wide variety or hip-hop music over the years, and actually enjoying some of it while despising an equal amount (more or less), I managed to reconcile my differences with the genre as a whole by means of dissecting its various themes and/or lyrical content.

I like rap songs with the type of themes and/or lyrical content that speak to the following:

1. Social consciousness
2. Politics &amp; Protest
3. Party rap
4. Love &amp; romance
5. Comedy or song parody
6. Christian, Motivational or Spiritual oriented hip-hop / rap

I strongly dislike (ok basically hate) rap songs with the type of themes and/or lyrical content that speak to the following:

1. Drugs
2. Thugs
3. Glorification of crime and/or high crime cities or areas (There's a difference between telling a story about where one is from as opposed to bragging about the drugs, thugs and murders that take place there.)
4. Misogyny (I can do without all the reference to bitches and ho's etc.)
5. N-word in damn near every verse or lyric which is just plain ignorant as far as I'm concerned.

There are many socio-economic reasons why so many people support the latter types of rap music themes that probably range from relating to it on a *'personal level'...* to *'entertainment' ...to 'honest and open-minded musical diversity'...* to *'just trying to fit-in with friends.'* I might not have covered all the reasons so many people dig the gangsta rap type stuff, but I'm sure I've touched on most of them.

As for me, well... if I'm going to listen to hip-hop/rap music at all, then I prefer a theme and lyrics with some substance, and not a bunch of poorly articulated chanting or mumbling about something ignorant, irresponsible and MINDLESS that does nothing for the spirit, soul or mind except promote and encourage anger, negativity and crime with backing music that sounds like a damn death and destruction scene from a horror movie! I mean like when you stop and actually think about it, you have to ask yourself *""do record companies and producers scientifically select certain types of backing music (or beats) and/or sound frequencies that attract certain people (or certain* ***races*** *of people) so they will buy certain types of rap music?""* As a Black adult who appreciates ***real music,*** I am glad that I can say none of this crap works for me or ON me!

How about THIS question: Why do we insist on making stars out of no-talent bums who do nothing but prance back and forth across a stage with their pants sagging looking like ""come and get it"" and yellin' about ***nothing?***!! I would rather listen to a good R&amp;B, rock, pop, disco, smooth jazz or even a C&amp;W song ANYDAY than the *ghetto garbage* that makes the charts these days... *and THAT'S coming from a Black man!* Yeah that's right... *some of us know better.*

As a Black man in America who genuinely ***does not care*** how popular and worldwide gangsta rap music has become... and someone who is not intimidated by its supporters and followers, I am compelled to take this topic one *'social and racial'* step further. Therefore, I have no problem coming right out and saying... and you can quote me on this... ""I honestly believe there are certain folks who literally ENJOY watching Black people (especially Black men) act like modern-day buffoons in the way they speak, dress, call one another the N-word, and even KILL each other over drugs and/or beefs."" I want any and everyone who reads this post to thoroughly understand that I am not saying ***all*** non-Black individuals think this way, but I ***am*** saying I strongly believe there are those who do. The list of gangsta rappers who have been killed continues to grow, and ***this*** should tell somebody *something* about the vile nature of their music and the company some of these individuals keep. What's the old adage within the Black community itself? ""You take a *ninja* out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of a *ninja*."" (Word substitution with 'ninja' was deliberate because I ***will not*** call another Black man the n-word in any form or spelling.) What I will say, however, is this: Ghetto is a '*state of mind'* as it relates to the way one thinks, behaves and lives life.""

Yes we all know that crime has always existed in the low-income neighborhoods we have normalized and popularized by calling ""The Hood"" (then complain when they become 'colonized' due to gentrification)... yeah we know about the crime rate in these areas... and the violence inspired by all this gangsta rap crap has definitely NOT helped. Sure some rappers channel some of their money back into the communities that helped put them on a pedestal, but no one wants to talk about the actual social, psychological and legal harm that's being done to so many low-income and at-risk Black and Brown youth in the damn PROCESS! I urge parents of younger kids and teens to pay attention to what their kids are listening to! Don't give up, and don't give in to the negativity just because it's popular and has been glamorized!

SOMEBODY PLEASE TAKE BACK THE MUSIC!!!

P.S. Yeah I know I'll probably catch a lot of smack for my views, and that's cool. The words stand on their own merit, and I do not intend to debate, argue, retract or apologize for my thoughts and opinions. As a matter of face, I fired up and ***added*** narrative since the original post, and the trolls and haters I have encountered can give themselves a round of applause for that."
fraggle200	2021-04-19 07:55:12+00:00	6 month old's napping is going in reverse. Is there anything else I can do?	"My son's 6 months and it seems that in the last 2 weeks his napping is going in reverse and getting shorter rather than him consolidating sleep cycles and napping for longer. 

My other half thinks we should be thankful for the fact he sleeps for 11-12hrs every night, which I am, but we're now getting to the point where he's getting about 1hr of napping during the day and the last 3-4hrs before his bedtime are a battle as he's so tired he doesn't know what way's up. the night before last, he was so tired that when we eventually got him to sleep for his last nap, he was fast asleep as if it was bed time. It wasn't a fun experience for anyone when we woke him up to change him before putting him to bed properly. 

He never napped for great periods of time up till now, he'd usually max out about 37 mins but over the course of the day, with 4-5 naps, this got him enough to make sure we weren't fighting an uphill battle. 

I've looked everywhere for advice on this and I think we're doing everything we can, I just don't know if there's anything else to try. 

Nap time starts with a 10-15 mins of wind down in a darkened room after the first or 2nd yawn appears, we change his diaper, put him down in his cot and, as previously within a few minutes he'd be asleep, now he lies there and gets more and more frantic and can't settle. I've resorted to holding him a few times till he's fallen asleep but I don't want to start something I later have to undo. pacifiers don't settle him as they're just the most fun thing ever to play with it seems and get him more worked up. 

Has anyone else had this and got through it? does it pass? or do we just accept that he's not great at napping and be thankful for the solid nights sleep? I'd happily give up an hour or 2 at night to get them during the day. There's the potential for teething but he's not too interested in anything that would help with that."

shaaawz	2021-04-19 07:04:42+00:00	A stranger’s “friendliness” had me frozen in fear	"This happened today and I literally cannot stop thinking about it. So I wanted to share it with this community to see what your insights might be on this situation. 

I was at the local goodwill store with my sister and two daughters (ages 4 and 1.5). My youngest is just learning to speak and her favorite word right now is “daddy”. She obviously calls her dad “daddy”, but she also says it to other people too...including random men she sees when we’re out and about. 

Usually, when she calls a random man “daddy”, they chuckle and move on. Well, today at the checkout line, she pointed at this man behind us and calls him “daddy”. He started laughing and joking, “oh I don’t remember making you!” “Maybe I was your daddy in a different life!”

It was weird and I just gave a weak smile and thought it was over...But then this random man came over to me and picked my baby up out of the shopping cart. I watched this happen in slow motion. My sister whispered “don’t let this happen” but I was legit frozen in this weird politeness/fear induced stupor. 

Obviously baby was really uncomfortable and reaching for me. And he gave her back but my heart was racing the entire time and I couldn’t wait to get out of that store. 

He then bought her candy and gave it to her and I cannot stress how uncomfortable the situation made me feel. Even now, in the comfort of my home, with baby sleeping next to me, I feel uneasy about this situation. 

I think what scares me the most is just how unpredictable people can be and also how you really don’t know how you’d react when something unexpected happens. I’ve always considered myself a strong mama bear but in that moment...I just let this strange man pick up my baby and I just didn’t know what to do."

KleinSct5655	2021-04-19 05:34:44+00:00	How to get rid of iPads	"So COVID threw a wrench into our parenting completely and now my kids are used to using our iPads for 3-5 hours a day.     

One is 6, and one is 4.   

I turned playing with their toys into an income earning opportunity (a dime for every day they don’t use their iPads) and they have 0 desire to do that. (They have piggy banks and are always asking how they can earn money.).      

So we’re taking away the iPads for a week.   
We’ve locked them away.     

But my 6 yo will just sit on the couch and suck his thumb, or he’ll just sit on the floor in front of his toys, looking sad and miserable and zero desire.  

I’ll get on the floor with him, and try to play, and he just has no smile, he wants nothing to do with me. He doesn’t like any of my play ideas.   

The 4 yo dives right in. He has a blast when we play.   

The 6 yo has ADHD, I know this must make a difference somehow. I just feel like he’s miserable... he doesn’t want anything to do with playing with me or his dad or his sibling. He just wants his iPad.  

He even told me: “fine take it away for a week! but after a week? I’m just gonna go back to using it.”   


To which I replied; “that sounds like you’re threatening me, and I will not let you speak to me that way. That is not acceptable.”   

I’m screwing everything up, aren’t I? Is it too late? Is there no going back from the iPad?"
sunset2020	2021-04-19 05:22:30+00:00	Is it normal for a 3 year old to not be potty trained?	"I Googled because my 37 month old is still not potty trained (we had success a couple months ago for like a week! And then painful constipation hit and he refused to go anywhere near a potty, or even poop for awhile! 10 steps back! So we've taken a break). So I Googled how to potty train a 3 year old (lol?) and this popped up. Read it and weep! (For joy, hopefully):

""The American Association of Pediatrics reports that kids who begin potty training at 18 months are generally not fully trained until age 4, while kids who begin training at age 2 are generally fully trained by age 3. Many kids will not master bowel movements on the toilet until well into their fourth year."""
OutrageousSea5212	2021-04-19 05:19:31+00:00	My husband's brother shows no interest in our new baby.	"Is this a common thing? My husband's older brother has zero interest in our baby (ie asking how my SO is doing as a dad or asking to see how the baby is doing). There's been literally no acknowledgment or congratulations... And our first baby is 7 months now.  He's never checked in with my husband to see how he was coping as a new dad. It's really hurt my SO's feelings. 

My brother in law has a few kids himself and, while he does generally keep to himself, has texted to ask my husband other things. Just never any mention of the baby. 

We send Christmas gifts to his kids and hang out with his kids when they're in town. His brother hasn't seen our baby yet due to COVID in our area, but the complete lack of attention has been really disappointing. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Just wondering if it's a common occurrence. 

Sucks because I feel like new dads don't have a ton of outside emotional support and this would have been a wonderful source for my SO."

It got misplaced and I never got to see her in it. Well I just found it again and it made me sad. So my husband suggested I alter it to fit again. I was feeling lazy and decided to just cut straight down a few inches in the back. Boom. Fits amazingly as a long shirt for her!

My daughter is almost 2 and a half and tomorrow is her first day at “school” at a great daycare in my town, and I’m so nervous! So  we haven’t been anywhere, that she would remember, due to Covid until last weekend. We had our youngest daughter baptized and as we were exiting the car and heading into the church she started crying and was scared saying she wanted to go home. She is so outgoing and loves to show off to her family—this just took us by surprise. Anyways tomorrow is her first day at the daycare and I’m so worried she’s going to cry and be scared and not enjoy herself at all. I know some crying is normal, but what if she’s the kid that cries for an hour and doesn’t ever get used to it? I can’t even be there for her on her first day either, it just tears me up inside. My mom, her grandma, is taking her tomorrow morning and picking her up. I just wish I could be there for her. But even if I could drop her off myself, due to Covid they don’t allow parents inside the classroom. It just sucks al around. Im. It sure what I’m looking for. I guess just reassurance that this is normal and she will be okay."

Is2020myyear	2021-04-19 04:18:24+00:00	Not sure what to think or do anymore.	"Hey guys, got quite a conundrum here. Married my now wife back in 2019 and gained two stepdaughters and their biological father in my life. All 3 of them suffer from ptsd and/or cptsd from living with this guy. Furthermore my youngest has a rare autoimmune disease where she needs monthly infusions and the older one has lost a lot of her executive function processing power in her brain. 

I work a full time job from home due to covid and my wife and kids are also home full time due to covid as well. Kids are only here 50 percent of the time. 

I was raised in a house where swearing was kept to a minimum and if you loved someone and respected them you didn't swear at that at any time. My wife and her ex however have taught the kids that swearing is a common everyday occurrence and it is perfectly OK to call your teacher a b1tch when muted on zoom calls etc. Today it escalated into another fight with her because I calmly asked the youngest one to please stop using the f word anytime someone says something she doesn't like.

Anytime I try to calmly ask for a little respect from her or the kids in any manner she is quick to put me down and yell at me that I don't know the trauma that her or the kids have gone through or are going through and how dare I expect any of them to change when they aren't the problem.

We have tried couples counseling together but we were dismissed due to her unwillingness to realize or take accountability for her actions in the marital issues. The counselor also noted that she needed to work on the verbal and emotional abuse she was imposing on me just in our sessions let alone at home yet she continues to text me 100+ times when we get into a disagreement that I'm the problem and need to just accept the 3 of them for who they are instead of asking for the love and respect I provide to them.

Has anyone been down this road and had anything come of it other than leaving and finding a better life on the other side? I am still in counseling and got her to agree to couples counseling again tonight but with the stipulation that she was just going to do it to explain to the counselor what I need to change. 

I'm literally at the end of my rope and my heart is breaking to even admit that there are problems this big in the relationship I once felt so hopeful and excited about."
pandamonkey23	2021-04-19 03:56:56+00:00	Is changing daycare centres traumatic?	"Changing day care centres - is it traumatic for the kid? Considering moving my son to a centre with a much better reputation and Montessori preschool program (he’s been on the wait list since birth). 

My son is a little over 2.5 years old. He has lots of friends at the play-based centre where he is currently and seems to enjoy his day. He has been there since 10 months old and sees some of the kids outside of daycare. He does struggle to seperate in the mornings though. The staff turnover has been really high at his centre and the other place has very little staff changeover (teachers have been there for a minimum of 5 years). I was planning to move him at the end of this year but just heard of another favourite staff member leaving so I may try to get him a spot sooner. I mentioned this to a friend and she felt that a move would be quite traumatising at this age, with so much to get used to that is new. 

So my question is this - do the benefits of the change (constant and highly qualified staff, accredited Montessori program, great word of mouth reputation) outweigh the negatives (losing connections with friends, starting a new routine, getting used to new expectations/friends, slightly longer commute of extra 10 mins)? Unsure what is more important in the final years before starting school. 

For context, I wouldn’t describe my son as easy-going. He is highly emotional but also quite fun and social. He seeks out new friendship connections at the park etc.  I know that the research suggests that changing daycare centres has a negative impact on kids overall. I’m just quite fed up with the staff changes and the academic program is very basic for his preschool year. The other positive about changing is that he would be paving the way for his baby brother to get a spot at the highly regarded centre as well. 

Any parents of 2.5-3 year olds change daycare centres without too much drama?"
JTT841	2021-04-19 03:40:37+00:00	7 year old wants to do everything herself	"Hey everyone,

I have a daughter that just turned 7. When she was 2 she started wanting to help out with things, especially when her brother was born. She was very hands on and wanted to help us with everything regarding her brother like helping getting him dressed, changing diapers, feeding him, bathing, etc..
As she got older, she wanted to do a lot more things on her own like dressing herself, getting water from the fridge, getting her own snacks, etc.. well it got to the point where if we did things that she wanted to do, she would get really upset. For example, she wanted to always turn on/off lights in our bedroom and living room in the mornings and nights. If she saw that we turned them on in the morning, she would get upset and sometimes throw a huge tantrum. We explained to her that we needed to turn them on to see because we are helping get her brother ready for school and we have to wake up before she does.
She kept getting upset every morning until she finally accepted it/let it go. Her thing right now is that she wants to feed the cat, give her water, say goodnight and turn off the lights. Today before going to sleep I turned on the lights without thinking about it and she started getting upset. Our cat needed her water fountain refilled and it was later than normal so I was more in a rush, so I told her that I had to help with the water today. She got so upset that she started crying. I tried getting her to understand that these are little things that shouldn't make her so upset and that it's OK to have/get help or share responsibilities. Over the years I have also done some of the things she normally does so that it doesn't become such a habit of her always doing a specific thing. I don't know what else to do. I know that toddlers have the do everything myself phase, but is it normal for a 7 year old to still be like that?"
BrittanyD2214	2021-04-19 03:32:50+00:00	What to do about my baby waking up many times throughout the night?	"My baby is 7.5 months old and she has always woken up through the night (at least 3-6 times throughout the night). I give her a bottle when she wakes up and she goes right back to sleep. But I read online that at 6 months, they can’t stop the night feedings and be okay. 

Can anyone give me advice on what to do in this matter? I do wish my baby would not wake up as much as she does, but I feel like this is normal and not a whole lot can be done about it. She is teething and her teeth will probably come in soon, so that could be another factor. But I appreciate any advice on the matter. Thanks!

Spoiledwife77	2021-04-19 02:42:20+00:00	I’m about to lose my sh*t!	"Idk if anyone remembers but awhile back I posted about CPS placing my grandchildren with us. They were 3 weeks and 18 months at the time. We have had them over a year now and we now have a court order in place.  We want to keep them, and are worried they could go back to their sh*t parents. This next year will decide. 🤞🏻 

I have to give props to parents of children close in age!! I had my kids 7 years apart! I never had to do 2 kids in diapers at the same time!! Y’all deserve a flipping metal! I feel like I’m going to lose my shit some days! I have the main home inspection tomorrow , I have known for a week. I have been cleaning like crazy until like 2 days ago I said screw it and played the PS4 instead. 

I guess what chaps my ass is we have no help! My mom does what she can. But if I need to go to the dr or something where I can’t take kids I have to hope I can get it taken care of in an hour or 2 cause mom can’t handle both kids at the same time for very long. I tell CPS that and I get “nothing”. I can’t get daycare cause both of us don’t work for 40 hours a week. My husband works 40 hours a week but my job is a homemaker. Apparently that’s not considered a “job” and we definitely can’t afford daycare on our own. I have no family or friends that can watch them, they either have jobs or live to far away. 🤬 so to keep from going postal I do like I did a couple days ago and play video games instead of clean house.

The action/fight scenes he would have when he was younger are now replaced with random screeching, odd babbling, screaming. He will play video games with friends and they all make noises over their mics. Right now, he is playing with the dog and talking out random syllables as he rolls on the ground with her. 

I know, I know. Enjoy the noise now because one day I will miss it. I think it might just have to be a thing I enjoy in retrospect because it drives me mad! When does it stop?? I grew up with sisters so I have no idea if it ever stops. Until then, I will just continue to take slow, deep breaths and attempt to tune it out 😂"
Complex_River	2021-04-19 02:01:39+00:00	Concerned about parentification of my child as a parent with disabilities. Advice?	"I know its coming for children of parents with signifigant disabilities to become parentified and I really want to avoid this at all costs. However I was raised by a disabled parent who didnt consider such things so I have very little to go on as far as knowing where the line is. 

I have a caregiver who comes a few days a week and helps with household and hygiene stuff. My daughter (age 5) has recently taken up a kind of expensive hobby and wants to be able to buy more stuff for it than I can afford regularly.  She suggested I pay her instead of the caregiver (for the house chores- I'm not comfortable having my kid help with personal hygiene stuff). And I'm considering it, but I worry that basically having her take care of the house could put her at risk for feeling like a parent on one hand, on the other I think it's cool she wants to work for and earn what she gets and I think that's valuable. 

She would basically be taking over almost all the house chores. Now we are clean people so shed never have to pick up our messes, itd just be normal laundry, floors, kitchen, etc. She has put a great deal of effort into learning to do all these things well in hopes to get paid for them and she does just as good of a job as any adult. So, I would pay her the same as I do an adult. This would allow her to buy all the hobby stuff she wants (costume makeup and face painting gear). 

Like I dont want her to feel like the whole house is her responsibility, but at this point she keeps cleaning stuff to prove that she does a good job because she wants to be able to buy the stuff she wants so bad that I worry by not letter her take over a bunch of household stuff I'm sending the message that she isnt good enough or worthy of the responsibility. 

I've thought about this all week and told her I'd have an answer for her tomorrow and I still dont know what to say. This girl cleaned the whole houses baseboards yesterday while I took a nap to show me why I should give her the ""job"". 

I also love how much shes into the math of figuring out how much shed have to work to buy the things she wants. My current caregiver is cool and doesnt mind her hours/income being cut to do this, and she can go right back to it if my kid doesnt want to anymore. Its $80 a week worth of work. The current caregiver gets it regardless of how long it takes (shes super fast so hourly wasn't fair) so my kid would get paid the same for the same tasks.

I dont know if I'm overthinking this because I worry about the whole parentification thing what would yall do in this situation?"
Rain_Braid	2021-04-19 01:52:57+00:00	Sister-In-Law won't let her baby cry or feel discomfort among other things.	"My SIL had her first baby in the beginning of the pandemic, he's a year old in May. So far she seems to be a very paranoid and protective mother. She basically won't let her baby cry and if he does start fussing she's running over to save him and scold the person who let him cry, like they did something to him. He's not reaching milestones like crawling because she's scared he'll get hurt? We told them to baby proof the house but it's still not enough. He even wears a special helmet now. 

It's like she always needs to be near him or she has a panic attack. The baby now cries if she's not near and he didn't used to do that. 

The husband gets this is an issue but he's also over protective too, as well as being sensitive to his wife's  anxiety. So he's not really doing anything to change anything. 

I feel like we shouldn't say shit because everyone has their way of raising their kids and everyone has their own opinion but this is just crazy."
spicymilk0	2021-04-19 01:01:59+00:00	I'm so afraid I've messed up with my daughter.	"My daughter is 3, will be 4 in June. She was born preterm but it's never stopped her. The plan was to start putting her in daycare last year but the pandemic shot that to hell and back. And now she's supposed to start preschool but I am so worried she's fallen way behind on her socialization and emotional behavior. 

Unfortunately I had to work and since the local daycares around me weren't accepting new kids, she went to grandma's. She's never played or even really been around kids her age. She does well playing by herself but it's only for an hour at most. Today, we went to our neighbor park and there was this other family (both kids were wearing masks) and he wanted to play with my daughter *so* bad and she just...froze and came and hid behind me and started crying. She has no idea how to play with others. She's my only child so it's not like she's had other children to model that behavior for her.

Her pediatrician has been against daycare since the pandemic started and has told me I'm not the only parent who will have socially stunted children but damnit, I am worried. What if she has awful social anxiety when she's older because of this? I worry that once she is in school, she won't be able to handle it. It's always been me and her and my mom doing the childcare so I really feel like I've dropped the ball here. :/"
nyokarose	2021-04-19 00:22:49+00:00	Should I buy our baby her own airplane seat?	"I am a mom with anxiety trying to figure out the best thing to do for our flight to Grandma’s.

We have a 6mo little girl. The flight is 3 hours long. Do I buy her her own seat??

Pros: 
-Safety during takeoff/landing &amp; potential turbulence or emergency landing
-Car seat doesn’t get thrown around by luggage handlers
-Extra space in row

Cons
- She hates the car seat and screams quite often in it, so I’d be tempted to get her out of it to not bother other passengers
- $1000/year of extra flight tickets

I know the odds of bad turbulence are probably 1 in 1000 or more, and my husband thinks I’m being a bit overanxious since so many people fly with lap children. 

Thoughts?"
hybriss099	2021-04-19 00:07:48+00:00	Baby won’t sleep for daddy	"My wife and I have a 2 month old son. It’s our first child. In the last maybe two weeks, he no longer lets me put him to sleep at all. At first it was just at night my wife would have to rock him to sleep after I fed him, because he would stay up for hours with me if I tried. Now it’s started to happen during naps throughout the day too. I’ll do all the same things my wife does - I’ll hold him the same way, I’ll rock him the same way, I’ll walk with him, I’ll pat his butt or rub his feet. Nothing. I wouldn’t be so bothered if it was just his mom he liked better. That’s pretty expected, but he sleeps for everyone but me. My moms wife is retired and has been helping throughout the day while my wife is on maternity leave - she has no problem rocking him to sleep. His grandpa will come over in the evenings and watch him while my wife and I eat or go on a walk or something, and he has no issues getting him to sleep. My mom maybe comes over once a week, today she rocked him to sleep in minutes. It is just me. When I try he just cries and cries until someone else take him, then it’s almost instant relief. He loves me otherwise. We play and he gets big smiles and even brightens up when he sees me when waking up from a nap. I guess I’m just not comforting for him, which is starting to bum me out. Any suggestions on things for me to try so he feels more soothed by me?"
sarabobara31	2021-04-18 23:47:53+00:00	Second pregnancy very different from first	"TW for brief mention of postpartum depression. 

I don’t know if it’s the pandemic, my husband’s night time work schedule, or parenting a full blown threenager (maybe the unholy combination of it all) but I am completely wiped out. I’m super tired all the time. I’m scared to be around too many people. I was way sicker this time around. This pregnancy was also not planned. We were going to wait another year (pandemic and I started a new job last fall), but oops we had a contraception fail. 

I just feel completely detached from this pregnancy and I’m 25ish weeks along. Our nursery is nowhere near ready. Don’t even ask me about a theme. I start looking on Pinterest for inspiration and then close the app after 5 minutes. Hubby asks my thoughts on names. No idea. I haven’t been looking except for the day we found the gender out. I was way sicker this time around, and was on medication until 18 weeks. 

It just all feels bad this time around. I’m back in therapy because I had PPD with my last and I was doing great mentally until the morning sickness kicked in. Now I just feel so drained all the time and like I couldn’t care less about being pregnant right now. I don’t feel excited when the baby kicks or moves. I don’t feel excited for anything baby related really. The only two things I have gotten excited about where the first ultrasound and our non explosive gender reveal. 

Does this get better? Has anyone felt like this with baby number 2?"
DefNotIWBM	2021-04-18 23:43:39+00:00	Husband and I disagreeing on 4-year-old eating practices/rules	"Hubs and I disagreeing on meals issues - 4 year old

Hi. Hubs and I are irritated with each other regarding a disagreement we had today. Our four year old was eating a lunch I prepared her: Noodle soup, whole wheat crackers, and a banana. She didn’t want anything except the crackers. She ate all the crackers and asked for more. Hubs told her no, she would have to eat more soup and banana first. I told him to just get her more crackers because what’s wrong with seconds? Our kid is very tall and skinny (33-34 lbs). So we went back and forth about that for a while. Meanwhile, she said she was done. She wasn’t going to eat any soup or banana and just wanted the five whole wheat crackers she had had. Then husband goes and makes her some peanut butter bread since she didn’t like her lunch, which I think sets a pretty terrible precedent, making us essentially into short order cooks.

So: 

If your kid wants seconds of something on their plate, do you make them clean the whole plate first? What if your kid is underweight? Isn’t seconds of at least part of the plate a good thing?


Also: Do you think it’s okay to make your kid a second main item if they don’t like the first main item?

Super annoyed and would like to come to a practical/reasonable agreement to avoid future issues. Thanks.

Note: I should also add that we are not a “clean your plate” household. I have been forced to clean my plate before until feeling sick. So we never force her to eat anything. She gets three meals and two snacks per day."
simplygrimly	2021-04-18 23:28:25+00:00	Need advice for intact son	"So my son is intact (uncircumcised) and is the first in either mine or SO’s family to be left intact. So we’ve basically been reliant on online advice and books as well as (sometimes questionable) pediatrician’s advice in terms of care and potty training. 

Son is seven now so we’re happily through most of potty training (nights are still a struggle) but I have a question that feels silly but I can’t seem to find a real answer to. 

When he pees, my son currently wipes after with a little square of tissue. I’ve never seen this advice but it’s what my SO told him to do. I’ve read online that it’s better to teach him to pull his skin back a bit for cleanliness but I know there are risks with detaching the skin before it’s ready. 

So basically what I’m asking is, is my SO right that he needs to wipe? Or is there a better way to teach him to use the restroom and walk away as clean as possible to prevent infections?"
LittleHouseBigMouse	2021-04-18 23:21:05+00:00	One of the hardest parts of having a kid with mental illness is the lack of understanding	"I have 3 kids. 15, 14, and 9. The 15 year old suffers from depression and anxiety. We are in a good spot right now and I am happy but there is so much misunderstanding of what that actually means. From family to friends people assume that because he is doing better that means all of his issues are resolved. Yes, we are in a good spot but I still go to bed worried that things will be worse tomorrow. I worry about things most parents of 15 year olds don't have to worry about. Sometimes it is even worse around the parents of my other friends kids. Being at a basketball game with my 14 year old or a dance competition with my 9 year old and being able to finally feel like a normal parent with normal concerns only to feel guilty for thinking that way. It's just so hard sometimes and so hard to talk about with people who don't get it. I tried talking to my sister about it and she was like, ""I thought J was doing good now?"" I know she means well but mental illness is a day to day thing. He isn't cured because he had a good day,  you know?"
Ok-Boss-2422	2021-04-18 23:16:53+00:00	"My 1 month old doesnt stop crying, idk what else to do"	"FTM, he loves baths but even that wont calm him down for the night. He will be fed, burped, changed and all his needs are met.

I will wear him or hold him and still he cries. He will settle down and sleep anywhere from 30 min to 2 hours it will never be the same.

I've tried to soothe him in his crib, bassinet just next to me and it doesnt work.

I've taken him to the windows to see the sun and get sunlight. I massage his belly and face, we've gone on walks.

I keep being told I just need to make it to 3 months and it will get better. I'm exhausted and feel like a failure of a mom.

Is this normal? Can I try something else?"
Shinybrainpan	2021-04-18 23:10:31+00:00	Should I stop picking up my child?	"First time on r/parenting, hello! I am a 28f mom to a soon to be 5 year old boy. 
We are very affectionate with each other and love to snuggle and hug each other. Lately I have been questioning if I should stop picking him up, I still do under certain circumstances. When I’m introducing him to a new adult, for example, sometimes I will pick him up so he is closer to their level and has a better time focusing. When we are crossing a street, I will sometimes pick him up because he often walks very slowly and I just don’t feel that it’s safe to linger on the road. If I have no choice but to bring him to the grocery store with me, I typically have him sitting in the cart so he doesn’t wander off and like I mentioned, he can be very sluggish and I do not like to linger in public places. I am wondering if this is something I should start weaning myself off of right away, he is getting older and I want him to be able to function without me of course. It’s quite a habit of mine but I do notice myself doing it these days. At this point in his life he does not have any cognitive or physical disabilities that we’re aware of."
njcuban123	2021-04-18 22:54:02+00:00	Teenage son wants to drive 45 mins to meet a girl	"So, our son wants to drive 45 mins to go see a girl that we know nothing about. He will not tell us who she is, as he claims is personal.  He's 16 and just got his license. He claims that he can drive safely there. We've never been to that area ourselves. He's being extremely violent about it, saying that we are controlling him, etc, etc. 

My take is that we need to know 1) who he's meeting 2) where exactly and 3) how long he will be out. We do have tracking set up in the car. 

Are we right to say no, and under what conditions should we say yes?  Also, he's not doing great in school at the moment."
CuddlefishSpaceKitty	2021-04-18 22:10:02+00:00	I took away my 16 year old girl's phone. She refused to use her phone for six months.	"So my 16 year old came home after curfew of 11pm and as a consequence I confiscated her phone for 24 hours. When I took it she seemed apathetic with the whole ""I don't care"" attitude.

I understand this response is common from teenagers so I didn't think much of it. 

The next night when I tried to give it back, she told me to keep it because she didn't want it. I thought she was just bitter and trying to prove a point and I put her phone away in my safe for when she would ask for it back. Its been 6 months, I've been trying to get her to use her phone so I can text and call her when she's out to make sure she's okay. She just responds with ""I don't want it."" 

My daughter is really stubborn and she's always been like that. She's mature for her age and is generally very responsible although she's almost impossible to effectively punish when she does break the rules. I've tried grounding her but she's extremely introverted and doesn't go out much anyway. She likes to play video games and I've tried temporarily confiscating her laptop except for when she uses it for school, but she started doing the same thing of just altogether not taking back her laptop after her punishment is over.

I'm at a loss for what to do. Any advice?"
Puzzler456	2021-04-18 22:02:14+00:00	Lost	"I have a son who turned 18 a few months ago. My husband, his stepfather, has never had a good relationship with him and we have been together for 11 years. My son has always been difficult—doesn’t like authority, yells, and throws fits when he doesn’t get his way. He yells at me as well. My husband has threatened kicking him out when he turns 18 for years now unless he changed his ways...We have tried counseling. 

Well, here we are. A few nights ago my son woke us up by calling from the bathroom at 130 in the morning. I tried to ask him what was wrong but he wouldn’t tell me. He yelled at me on the phone and I hung up. This pattern repeated 3 more times before I went to him. I’m not sure where it escalated to this point, but it ended up with my son saying “you f***ing b*tch get in here”—apparently he wanted to show me that he puked in the toilet but never said he was puking. When he said that, I went to smack his mouth, he blocked me, and ended up violently grabbing me to pull me into the bathroom. My husband saw this, came running down the hall, tackled and punched my son repeatedly. The police were called. The next day my husband goes and files for eviction and a restraining order to get my son out faster. 

The devastation that I am feeling right now is beyond explanation. Even though my son is completely disrespectful to me, he is my son. I feel like I’m giving up on him if I let this go through. I know my husband will not allow him to say. We have 2 other children that are also being devastated by this environment. Part of me is ready to leave my husband because I am feeling so much resentment towards him, and I love my son. The other part says if I do that I am going to completely destroy my other two children. So lost."
emmahar	2021-04-18 21:51:54+00:00	"5 year old not settling to sleep, help!"	"We're at the end of our tether with our 5 year old. She's never been consistent with sleep, especially settling at night, but we can't live with such stress levels every night. She doesn't tell us what's up, she just spends hours messing around- can you move this pillow? I'm hungry. I want to face this way, you're stupid, you're making me angry, go downstairs and kill mom, I don't love you and I'll never talk to you again, etc etc. She rarely leaves her room but if we leave she will sometimes follow us, sometimes shout us, then cry, then get more and more upset. We aren't happy with her crying and getting upset, its just not the way we wish to parent, but we're out of sympathy for her, especially since she doesn't tell us whats actually stopping her. We have tried lavender spray (scares monsters and helps to have good dreams), dreamcatcher, night lights, pillows, teddies, bunk bed so she can go on the floor if she prefers and its more ""contained"" so she might feel safer. Weve tried reward charts and taking away toys, but they don't seem to work.
Our general bedtime routine is bath at 6pm for half an hour, then out of the bath and in our room for supper and reading a book / colouring in (with both of us), then brush teeth, in her room, 2 books with dim light, then we will sit in her room while she settles. We believe she has some anxiety and is definitely a sensitive spirited child, which is why we're happy sitting with her, but not while she's taking the piss with BS and not actually telling us the problem. She is usually, settled by 8.30 but often goes to 10pm.
We have stayed at other peoples houses and she usually settles well, we asked her why she's good at their house and she says ""because I want to impress them"". Why can't she impress us? She stays at her dads house on weekends and sleeps fine there, they don't stay in with her, they just leave her.
Weve told her about the importance of sleep, watched videos on it, our friends and family have reiterated it too. I feel like we should at least get 1 hour a day to ourselves after 5 years of this inconsistency"

dariaelizabeth	2021-04-18 21:08:18+00:00	Bad potty training regression with almost 4 year old.	"My son is almost 4. Potty training had been a 2 year long nightmare. Like. We should just burn the house down and start over. Every inch has been covered in shit and piss. 

My son was doing really well. Even taking himself to the potty occasionally. Now. He’s just. Not potty trained. It disappeared.  We’ve had no changed in the house. Nothing. He’s sleeping fine. All is good. He’s just not potty trained. 

I don’t believe this is a behaviour issues. I truly don’t. I know when my son is being a jerk. He just doesn’t seem to feel it. He will pee down to his socks and either act totally normal, or play quietly in one area so I don’t notice. (I’ve never punished him and never will for accidents, but he for sure knows they upset me). 

I’m really looking forward to this phase of my life to just be done.  And there have been so many times I’ve seen progress. Then we’re back to zero. We’ve seen a family doctor and Pediatrician. I’ve taken a potty training course online. (Oh crap potty training). Other than having some sensory issues my son is totally normal. He’s. Just. Not.  Effing. Potty trained.  

Anyone have help with regressions?  Do they just pass?  I get my son to help with cleanup but honestly he seems upset about the accidents so I try not to make him feel worse than he already does."
ermonda	2021-04-18 20:43:57+00:00	What do you do for young child’s chronic constipation	"My 4 year old has been dealing with constipation for a long time. We have brought her to the doctors. It gets better for a time but then bad again. 

We currently give her a half capful of mirilax a day. However, when she gets backed up a day or two she becomes terrified that it will hurt when she goes to the bathroom so she holds it in and makes it ten times worsen. This past week she went 6 days without pooping. She was so uncomfortable but couldn’t/wouldn’t get it out. When it gets this bad she also starts to hold her urine because she is so afraid of sitting on the toilet/pooping. 

She eats a good amount of fruit everyday. No veggies really but she eats chicken nuggets that have the veggies mixed in and sometimes we can get her to eat carrots. She is a picky eater but recently she has been trying new things. 

How do other parents deal with this? Please tell me anything you have found useful. 

She does have an autoimmune disease (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) but she is currently in medicated remission. Her medication, enbrel is not supposed to cause constipation."

He does this always when on his stomach. He started doing this just as he figured out how to move forward for the first time, by doing these crawl-leaps. 

Several times a day, ranging from 2 to 5 seconds, he would do this, and always look confused while he does it. I doubt it's one of the regular behavioral quirks that babies exhibit.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Does this look normal? My wife thinks it's entirely normal, but to me it seems everything but. This week he also started randomly shaking his head side to side, especially when in his crib, and it's sleeping time.

I'm sharing two videos where this happens. In some instances it was even more pronounced, than in these recordings.

"My daughter is the only child in the family, and so every year for every holiday all of the grandparents would give her whole full bags upon bags of candy. After Easter she'd have 3 full packages of jelly beans, whole cartons of chocolate eggs, 8 chocolate bunnies, full bags of Hershey kisses, 6 oez dispensers, etc. It's been a battle for YEARS to have the grandparents stop giving us so much candy. Last time was Halloween when my MIL gave so much I almost cried during the unwrapping of the gifts. It's hard because my child has a weight problem, and so do I, and so does my husband, and I try very hard to keep limited junk food in the house. When I was almost in tears over the Halloween excess, my FIL said ""it's a lot, but just spread it out, you've got candy to last you until summer"" but there are so many problems with that. My child will ask for that candy 20 times a day and so they've turned me into a no machine, just saying no all day long. Or I can say yes, and let her eat candy all day long for 4 or 5 weeks until it's all gone. Ive done both strategies and they're both awful. It's just too much food. So this year Easter came and my MIL finally didn't give a bunch of candy! (Probably because she saw me almost cry on Halloween) She gave a small bit, which is perfect, along with some healthy treats like oranges and apples. I was so happy! Like finally, after 10 years, it's finally sunk in.

So then the day after Easter my daughter's best friend's grandmother (who is her guardian, so knows my child well) drops off an Easter basket full of candy. 😭 Again, way over full. Bags and bags of candy, bags that are 30 servings per bag, she gave us 4 of them. She gave us 3 large chocolate bunnies. For 1 child! I'm so frustrated, and frankly this time my child wasn't even happy, she was like ""wow this is too much"" and she herself chose half to throw/give away. I felt weird saying anything to the lady, it was really nice and thoughtful, she had no way of knowing that we didn't want so much cand I guess.

So last night my daughter had a sleepover at this friend's house. And she was sent home with bags of candy! And packs of cheese crackers, and gummies, and gum, and six individually packed ""mug cakes"" for her to make herself a 500 calorie cake I guess? 6 500 calorie cakes? I'm so upset. I feel defeated.

My child's doctor has asked us to limit her ""junk food"" and so I asked my husband if he felt it would be weird for me to mention that to this friend's grandmother so she would stop giving us food like this? And he said it would be weird and that instead I should send the friend home with fruits and vegetables next time she's over...

What do I do? Accept the junk food and let my kid eat it all? Accept the junk food and encourage my child to throw/give some away, but then let her eat the rest even though doctor says it's a bad idea? Accept the junk food and say no a thousand times that she asks for it? Tell this woman about my child's medical issues so she will stop? Ask her to stop without divulging the reason? How do I not sound rude about it? It's all giving me so much anxiety."

username10661914	2021-04-18 18:17:51+00:00	I don’t understand how my daughter got so materialistic and shallow	"To preface: I love my daughter - I see myself in her the most, which might be my I’m taking this a bit hard

My 15 year old has been very materialistic lately. Designer brands are the only acceptable forms of clothing and she’s stopped valuing hard work

And I find it strange because that’s not how we raised her. She has an older brother (16, they’re Irish twins), a younger brother (13) and a younger sister (11) and she got hand me downs from her older cousin. We’ve always been quite well off but we’ve never taken it for granted. We drilled it into them that nothing comes if you don’t work hard. We even took them volunteering in remote settlements, to show them that we have it much better than many people, and also to teach them responsibility and kindness. I never bought any of them any designer clothes. And they’re certainly not spoilt

Plus, she’s become very different to her other siblings. My eldest, who’s like her best friend, is very down to earth and humble. My third is very sweet and bubbly and my fourth is super shy and intelligent. My daughter, however, is loud, quick-witted, sharp and persuasive (manipulative). She’s kind of like the “I only look out for number 1” person. No doubt she’d out-compete her siblings, if this were a nature documentary, but I’m wondering how she turned out so different. Make no mistake, I adore her spirit, but I’m just a bit confused

My husband (her father) usually buys her the designer gear, and I’m fine with it, because if she wants something, there are many of aunties and uncles she’s sweet-talked into loving her, who’ll pay for her. It’s better if it’s from our pocket and at least this way we can have a serious talk with her about her negative behaviour

With “hard work”, she’s a fighter, not a worker. Meaning if she gets a bad grade in class, she kicks up a fuss with the teacher and sometimes they change it. Not all the time obviously, but enough for her to think she’s a master manipulator

Maybe it’s her friends? She’s lucky enough to be at the “top of the social hierarchy”, as she tells me. It’s not something I encourage her to aim for but high school can be tough and I’m glad she’s found a place that makes her happy. And I’m not going to tell her she can’t hang out with her friends

I don’t know what to do. I’m worried if this attitude carries on, adult life is gonna hit her like a ghost train. We’ve done all we could to teach her the right lessons and it seems to have worked on our other kids. We try talking to her but it’s all just “ok mum and dad, you guys know best, I love you”, which blindsides us each time.

Anyway this is getting too long. Thanks for letting me vent

Tldr: I don’t get how she got so materialistic and shallow. Will she grow out of it?

PS: I don’t believe in comparing children to each other so the old “look at how great your brothers are” ain’t gonna cut it"

There a is an International MUN (Model United nations) that is recognized by the real United Nations. I would encourage you to get your kids (teens or younger if u have a prodigy) to participate in this event.
A certificate from an IMUN will make them stand out among a sea of applicants when they apply to University. Stanford and many other schools give this certificate a great deal of significance.
There is a 9 USD registration fee.
The one open now is on from 24th to the 25th of April. 
I would recommend getting registered now, as seats are limited and the kids would get enough time to prepare.
Here’s the [link to register.](https://www.internationalmun.org/RegistrationForm.php?mark=YY1633)

I hope this helps. 😊"

And school has been really hard for him for the last four years or so. 
I have a degree in fine arts painting. My mom is a well known artist. My mom said she was very similar to my son so her parents pushed her into art. 
She got scholarships to The Chicago art institute and Fulbright scholarships as well. 
I also had a very hard time in high school and boarding school really helped. I did much better in school and am still close with many of the kids I went to school with to this day. 
My kid also goes to an art based summer camp that he sadly she’s out of this year. It’s his happy place. It’s where he feels most at home. 
I googled art based boarding schools and it looks like there are a lot of them. 
Has anyone sent their kid to one? Do you have any you suggest? What is your experience? 
I thankfully am sure my family will help make this happen if we choose this path."

He can stand on his own, and walk while holding onto something but he can’t walk on his own. I’m a young first time mom and all my other mommy’s friends babies walk on their own at around 8-9 months. Plus, he doesn’t wave, point or clap. He can play with toys and eat with his hands. I’ve been trying to teach him to wave, clap and point but he doesn’t seem interested and is distracted by everything else. He came a month early at 36 weeks and even though he’s not technically premature I notice in the beginning that his mile stones came a month late, but he’s way late with walking and hand gestures. Should I be worried? Is this a sign something is wrong w my son."
MomIrishTwins	2021-04-18 17:49:04+00:00	Do I step in?	"Sorry this is long!

My son (27) met a highly conservative deeply religious girl (24) 3 years ago when she was a junior at a strict Christian College in the city where he works.   They “courted” for two years and were engaged for a year. Now we are a little left, and religious so we welcomed her into our family. Her family lives about 6 hours away so they only met my son 4 times before the wedding.  

Now in the three years they were together we spent a lot of time with them and got to know the girl well. We love her and we watched as she begin to figure out who she wanted to be away from the strict constraints of her family. And boy were they strict.

Fast forward past all the wedding drama, which was interesting. But a whole another issue. Here is the problem. 

Her family is putting a lot of pressure on this new couple to move to their little town.  There are no jobs for my son in his field he would have work for his FIL. My DIL would stay home even though she has a promising new career in her field of study.  

When I say pressure they threatened to disown their daughter if she didn’t comply and force my son to do the same. 

She has cried at my house this weekend in fear they will follow through.  They have a house here, they would have to live with the parents if they moved. My son makes six figures and my DIL could be making six figures in two years. The pay cut would be massive and interrupting their careers would be professional suicide.  

Her parents also want them to have kids right away. Neither of them want that for at least 3 years maybe longer if her career takes off. 

I’ve always been a “I’ll catch you if you fall” kind of patent allowing my kids to make their own decisions after 16, but I feel like I need to step in.



Should I and my husband step in?  How can I comfort my DIL if her parents do disown her?"
TheGreatLandSquirrel	2021-04-18 17:48:58+00:00	No more Super Grover	"I love my kid to death. But she has this one toy that drives me absolutely up the walls. It's a sesame street Super Grover cell phone. She's got a few toy cell phone that make nosies and I have no problem with them. This one however has no on/off switch. And the battery compartment is screwed shut for safety purposes. It could be sitting on the table unbothered for hours and all the sudden it will make this obnoxious clinking sound over and over again followed by Grover saying some stuff about being a super hero, or just straight up screaming! What an awful toy!

So I finally reached my breaking point. When my daughter was asleep and it randomly started going off again I decided that was it, I'm getting rid of the damn thing! So like any dad would do, I threw it under the faucet. Yet it still was chattering away. So next I just threw it in an empty pitcher in the sink and filled it up with water. Ha! That aught to do it. I pulled it out and watched the water slowly drain out. To my surprise, it still worked. So I threw it back in the pitcher and left it there for the night. Today I woke up and did the dishes. I pulled Grover from his watery grave and pressed some buttons. No sounds! Yes, I did it. So in the trash he went. The kid wasn't quite awake yet so I decided to enjoy my quiet morning with some Ghost of Tsushima on the Playstation. 

I'm playing for a bit and all of the sudden I hear it. ""I HAVE GOT SUPER POWERS!"" I think to myself ""my God, he really is indestructible."" so at this point I've had enough. It's trash day tomorrow so in the bin he goes. That's the last I hope to ever hear from grover. If you don't hear from me though, it's likely that he came back to get his revenge."

I’m so tired of this feeling like I can never have a truly close relationship with my child simply because we are both female. Are there any stories out there of daughters who grow up to love their mothers and not ONLY favor their fathers no matter what? I devote my life to being the best mother I can possibly be to my daughter and the thought that no matter what I do I’ll always be second-place to my daughter simply because I’m not “daddy” is so discouraging and heartbreaking. Sorry if this post doesn’t make much sense or seems silly. I’ve been wrestling with posting this for years now (because Reddit is brutal) and I don’t know if possibly my post could be offensive in some way. Please be gentle with me ya’ll.

tinymom7674	2021-04-18 17:32:32+00:00	How to handle other kids being rough at the park?	"So my husband and I try to take our daughter to the park on the weekends since he’s off from work then. We feel a little awkward at this park because most of the parents are “upper class”, so trying to mingle with them never really happens, but we manage with short greetings and that’s about it. 

The only real problem with these parents is that when they all get together at the park, and it’s usually a group of them that have brought their kids, they completely ignore their children and mingle with the other parents. I often times find myself having to as politely as possible tell another child to wait for my daughter to slide first, or ask another child to please not push my daughter out of the way. Sometimes a mom or dad comes rushing over and apologizes, but usually they glare up at me, the only mom on the equipment (by request of my daughter) or look really scared if it’s my husband (he’s heavily tattooed and muscular and does not fit in the with the other dads). 

Every time we go we never stay as long as we intend because no one is ever watching their kids and we don’t want to have to keep policing our daughter. She gets frustrated, we get frustrated, and the other parents don’t even know what’s happening. Today specifically, our daughter kept trying to slide and this older child kept climbing up the slide at the same time. No problem with climbing up, we let her do it, but he kept doing it every time she wanted to slide. Finally my husband was like, “Hey kid. Will you let my daughter slide?” The mother FINALLY noticed and didn’t really do anything the next five times he did it except tell him “No Jack!” It’s like at what point do you actually step in and say, “Hey, can you do something about your kid? There’s a million other places he could climb and slide and swing but he’s specifically not letting my daughter slide.” We don’t want to do this so we just end up leaving. 

How do you guys handle this without coming off as rude? I’m tired of looking around at the other mom just sipping their lattes and flapping their lips while their kid is barging in front of mine or screaming for their own mom to come help them."
BocceBurger	2021-04-18 17:18:52+00:00	My husband and I are at odds regarding the covid vaccine for our kid	"I (40F) was on the fence for a long time, and I finally swung to the pro vaccine side. He (41M) was thrilled, because he has always been pro vaccine. I signed us both up and we were waiting for a scheduling call for our shots. 

Then the news about blood clots came out and I got scared again. For history, I got a pulmonary embolism from a blood clot and almost died at age 34, no answer to why it happened. So I became fearful and back on the fence. I was still leaning towards yes, because my husband was so insistant that it was media hype and not a real concern.

Then I took our healthy 5 year old dog for routine vaccinations and had a (admittedly very rare) vaccine reaction (called IMHA) and after a $9000 stay in intensive care she died.

The following week the news reports that the J&amp;J vaccine is possibly causing clots. 

Two weeks go by, and we get our notices for our vaccine appointments. He's thrilled, and I canceled mine. He thinks I'm foolish, he says the clot thing is still just media hype. He says our dog's rare reaction should have no bearing on my decision to get a vaccine.

And then I tell him that I won't be having our child vaccinated either. She's not eligible yet, she's 11, but soon it will be available and I won't be taking her. I can't do it. I took my healthy dog and killed her with a vaccine. I can't risk it with my kid. He is so mad he wouldn't even talk, he walked away and went to work. I'm not sure how to proceed.

Parents of reddit, will you be vaccinating your children? Am I foolish in deciding this for my kid? Also, my kid wants the vaccine. She's aware the risks and she knows what happened to our dog. But, like, she's a child. Medical decisions are not hers to make. Right? How do we, as parents, make these choices and know we aren't damaging them or setting them up for future damage? I'm so lost and sad and torn. I miss my dog. I don't want to lose my kid. She's the only one I have, and she's precious, and irreplaceable, and covid isn't killing children is it? Or is it? I can't ever be sure if I'm reading real news or fake news, I don't ever know what to think. This is the hardest decision I've ever had to make. I'm terrified."
lindseydrums	2021-04-18 16:59:40+00:00	What is happening with my sons sleep?	"So my son is almost 10 months old. His morning nap usually happens fine with little protest and he's on a regular food schedule. 

His afternoon nap has been harder to get him down for, and sometimes he pushes it until after dinner. We'll let him sleep for an hour at most if that happens to keep him on schedule. He always naps in his crib. 

He is usually asleep around 8:30-9 pm and is very tired. He doesn't nap more than 3 hours during the day. 

The problem has been that he's waking up 2-3 times a night now and doesn't want to be put down. Sometimes he wants a bottle, but most of the time he falls right back asleep when we pick him up out of his crib. 

I thought we were out of the 8 month sleep regression. He was getting all 4 of his top teeth, but they have all broken through the gums. 

After a long 6 weeks of waking up through the 8 month sleep regression and now these couple weeks of multiple wake ups after one week of good sleep, my husband and I are really feeling the effects.

We keep having a couple of recurring issues and one of them is just something I'm struggling to do. 

We keep having issues with SD lying about things. I get all children do this and go through phases of it but with our situation and with issues with my partner's ex we're really trying to instill in her how important it is to tell the truth. 

There's been a few instances lately where I have seen SD doing something that she's not supposed to and she just turned around and says she didn't do it. This has caused issues with me and my partner as I'm saying SD should have a consequence for not doing as she's told and my partner takes SDs side which obviously causes more friction as SD has not done as she's told and is now lying on top of this and it has led to some heated arguments.  

Fast forward today and this happens again in the usual way but I manage to proove to my partner that what SD is saying isn't true and when my partner talks to her she admits she was lying. My partner got really annoyed at SD and told her off and told her she couldn't have the tablet for the next few days. 

Where I'm really struggling with this is literally 5 minutes after this SD is back to laughing and giggling and asking for a movie or to do other things. With the amount of trouble these lies are causing I find it hard to want to go back to laughing and giggling and wanting to do nice things so quickly. 

My partner says I'm in the wrong and I shouldn't be annoyed and should just let it go and kids do just go back that quickly. I'm not wanting to keep these things going but I find it hard to move on and stop being annoyed at SD for causing what are becoming quite serious  problems. 

Is it normal for a child to just move on from being told off? How do I let go of being annoyed so quickly? 

Any advice or experience would be really appreciated right now."

I'm jumping right into my early morning thoughts that are currently keeping me awake for the past 2 hours.

I'm pregnant with our first. We have a 3 bedroom house. Attic but can't use it, no basement (Texas). We have a garage, two cars parked in there currently and a backyard (mostly unused, we just moved here), expansion of house not possible. Husband and I have bedroom (room #1) that we share and a hobby room (room #2 aka. His office, my sewing room). We are expecting a boy early summer, his nursery is ready for use (room#3). 

We are planning on another child after this one. If it's a girl, they both will need separate rooms (or won't they?). If it's a boy, he might be able to stay with his older brother in the same room, just not sure how soon they can be together in the same room (Another early morning thought) . 

If separate rooms, we will be missing a hobby/office room. Also, we'll be missing extra space to sleep for guests (we only have them over once/twice a year) and extra space for storage space. 

How would you manage following:
2 adults with hobbies 
2 children 
Guests that stay the night for 2 weeks in a row
A noisy living room (vent/air-conditioning noise)

I'll be grateful for any ideas"
Delimadeluxe	2021-04-18 10:02:41+00:00	Is this sleep regression?	"Hey Reddit!!

My son is soon to be 4 months. 
Sleeping was horrible when he was newborn. Lots of stomach problems, didn’t sleep at night, I was sleeping 1 hour every 24 hours as I was so worried about him and had these crazy nights! 

Around 2 months he started to get into a rythm. Untill some days ago he had normal naps during the day and fell asleep between 7pm and 10pm (19.00 and 22.00), woke up to feed 2-3 times during the night and was awake/ready to party between 7am and 8am (07.00-08.00). Wonderful. 

But some days ago he started being problematic. Sleeping maybe 30 minutes from 8pm to 8.30pm and then wake up and crying if he wasnt in my arms. For the last 3 days i have been carying him around until my arms fall off almost until midnigt before he settles. 

Note: he has been struggling a bit with a cold so he is coughing a bit, sneezing often and sometimes has a blocked nose when he lays down. No fever. He is fine during the day though, smiling, laughing, talking with us, improving his tummy time by stretching his arms so he reaches higher with his upper body, breastfeeds, naps etc... 

Is this sleep regression or could it be the cold? 
Anyone with same experience?"
Rebekahm17	2021-04-18 09:35:24+00:00	Five month old suddenly waking up hungry all night long	"Hello all! My five month old has been going through a bit of a sleep regression lately, but I noticed that every time he wakes up, about every 3 hours, he is absolutely ravenous. He now is eating way more than he used to, and I am wondering what is going on. He is breastfed and then supplemented with a bottle (also with breast milk). He used to eat about 5 times a day, but now he is waking very hungry an additional two to three times at night to eat. We noticed last week that he was still appearing a little hungry after his usual daytime feedings, so our doctor recommended we start with a couple tablespoons of solids a day. But this does not appear to be helping as he now is waking up to eat all night long. Is it just part of a growth spurt or should we up his food intake during the day? It just seems that he already is eating so much...about 5 oz each feeding already and one time he was super hungry I gave him 6 oz, but that ended up with a ton of spit up. Sorry if this is a silly question, first time mom trying to figure it all out ha! I just don’t want to accidentally over feed him. Thanks!"

"I know a lot of people would get rather offended if their child called them by their first name, but why? I personally don't see anything inherently wrong with it. I don't think the claim that ""it's disrespectful"" has any stable ground to stand on and I think the only reason people have such a stance is because of culture and tradition. From a rational standpoint, there is no inherent difference or issue. What are your thoughts?"
BedBoundBean	2021-04-18 09:06:02+00:00	My 6 year is asking questions about different ethnicities and I need some advice	"I have no idea how to phrase this so if I say anything offensive I apologise in advance! 

So, as it says above my 6 year old daughter L is asking questions about different ethnicities etc. For context, we're waiting for neurodevelopment to assess her as it's highly suspected that she has autism though we're not quite sure where she is on the scale yet. All of our family is white. We live in the UK in a fairly rural area. My school was entirely white, so was my secondary school. 

My attitude towards this and any other questions brought up is the standard ""differences make people unique and everyone should be treated with respect regardless of those differences"", but the difficulty here is that she often says exactly what pops into her brain because that's just how she works.

I need advice on how I can appropriately phrase answers to questions she has, and how I can avoid her accidentally being racist to other children in her class. I wouldn't want her to upset another child, and of course neither would she. She's a very sensitive kid and gets very emotional if she thinks she's upset someone.

For example, on Friday she asked me why one of the children in her class, K, had black skin. I sat her down and talked about skin colour like it was hair colour, it was the only thing I could think to say, and I didn't want to leave her for a few minutes while I googled an appropriate response because she would have completely forgotten about it. This has been on my mind all weekend, I'm wondering if I answered her appropriately or if I could have handled it a different way.

Thank you for any responses!"

hendschos	2021-04-18 07:20:20+00:00	We created a monster!	"And I have no idea how to fix this. 

My daughter is eleven years old and she is a kid with no self esteem, no hobbies, almost no friends. She is manipulative, and easily frustrated. We as parents failed miserably and I don’t get much support from my wife to change this. 

I see the life of my girl going down right now, and i have no idea how to fix this. 

My wife and I have completely different approaches to parenting but to make things worse, we are both in need of harmony and shy away from conflict (my wife way more than me). 

We created this bubbly soft world in which my daughter exists but I know that life is not like that. Life doesn’t owe you anything and the sooner my daughter learns this the sooner she will become the daughter I wish her to be. 

Any tips on how to fix this mess would be much appreciated as I am really really afraid of the woman my daughter will become."

metsaema	2021-04-18 06:24:58+00:00	"Staying at home, working part-time... what to do?"	"Our original planning was that I wouldn't return to work after my maternity leave ends, I am comfortable with this decision... however, since I gave birth, my partner got the two first month free and is currently working part-time (and he normally works from home) while I am on my leave and this is being so good! I love that he gets time to get so involved with our daughter, and this is specially important since we are a multi-cultural family, so this time is important for her to also learn his language and have contact with his culture. 

Fortunately, we are in a good enough position that our work are quite flexible and it would be possible for us to work only part-time and still do well financially. In both scenario, he still works from home and I work in an hybrid way. We mostly can manage to work in different turns. He seems to like the idea, but I think he don't want to be so enthusiastic about it due to what we had planned before, and he is afraid I'll get over-worked, also we don't really know anyone who is doing something similar. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Does it worked for you? I would be happy if someone have any input to share."

Recently she mostly stopped napping for a few weeks (maybe 1-3 naps a week depending). Then she went back to napping for a week and now maybe back to no naps. If she naps (only about an hour) she takes over 2 hours to get to sleep but if she doesn’t she is oddly quiet, distracted, and is a bit more irritable from about 2pm. I’m not sure what to do... it seems like she needs a nap but over 2 hours to fall asleep is crazy. We tried napping 2 days a week but on those nap days it took her a long time to fall asleep again. If she naps (down at 12:30 and asleep by 1) her bedtime is 7 and if she doesn’t then 6-6:30. Weekday wake ups has to be 6:15am so if she takes too long to fall asleep she looses a ton of sleep."

I can't remember if it was on their subreddit or on other that I posted a question about how prominent people with established careers become so successful when they actually have the same set of responsibilities. They may have one or two kids, a spouse who is stay at home or they work full-time.

I recently came across a Youtuber who shared his time management in being a doctor, Youtuber, and social media fanatic (here's the link: https://youtu.be/5Nin1OtjOlU). At first I was wowed, but my always hones in on the their left hand, do they have a ring. Are they married or previously married? Do they have kids?

The reason I made this post as a question was to ask how many of you parents out there feel the same way I do and somewhat disgusted by people whole have challenging lives, manages 10 thousand things, yet married life with kids isn't one of the tasks. They go out and encourage people to strive, achieve, aim, be productive, when they don't understand a single bit about parenting.

Now, I know, I don't have to follow and I won't follow (hense the title). It doesn't apply to my life. Course you would also counter my post with, ""well, perhaps that isn't what he/she is aiming at (parents)"", or ""you could simply ignore them"", or "" who gives a f#@k, people can do and share whatever they want, your post is irrelevant!"". 🤣 My point is this, yes, we have the choice to choose what we consume, but I fear some parents fall in the trappings of such YouTubers who boast about how to do more in life, without knowing anything about parenting. 

Please don't see this post as a negative at first. All I want to say in the end is that I am a proud parent and that I understand, to a certain extent, the real struggles of parents out there. It's hard. There wi be days that suck, yet there are days you will never forget. I'm proud of you are who are toughing it out especially during this time with the pandemic. Just remember to carve out some time for yourself to recharge. It is very important that you do that. 5-10 to breath some fresh air from an open window or the back door to your porch. 

Please takecare of yourself. The little ones we look after are not just yours and my future, it is all of our futures. They need us at of it best, because we will need them at our worst.

lammisam	2021-04-18 05:46:58+00:00	"I (20F) am getting a kitten next month, but my parents told me no more cats... help!"	"I am currently a junior at a university  (20F) and I live in an apartment off campus with some roommates. We’re all just bored, Zoom students trying to survive COVID. I’ve been feeling the quarantine blues and have been thinking about getting a kitten for a while now. 

Whenever I’m at my apartment, no matter how I spend my time, I feel like something is missing and I think it’s the presence of a pet. I also really like the responsibility and accountability a pet holds over you. I’ve had a cat my whole life, and I currently have a family cat at home that my parents call “my cat”. My mom is insistent I take him to our new larger rental home that we move into next month. The only issue with this is my dad LOVES my cat too and doesn’t want to displace him from the family home because that’s where he grew up. My family cat, Walnut, is my baby and I’ll take him when my parents decide to move. I don’t think that’s any time soon though. 

Randomly browsing the internet one day, ;) , I happened upon a woman on Facebook who said her cat was pregnant and about to pop any second, so I messaged her and got a spot in line impulsively... The only problem is my parents have strictly told me NO more cats, but IMO this would be a really good thing for me and for Walnut. My parents have overfed my precious Wally to a 25 lb chonk and he desperately needs to lose weight. I want to take him, put him on a strict diet, and raise him with another cat so hopefully he loses weight because he’s only three years old and needs more mental stimulation! I’ll probably be allowed to take him to my new place in the winter so I will have time to get the two cats friendly with each other. Walnut is friends with the neighbor cats so I have no doubt he’d like a buddy to keep him company. He tries to interact with my dog too but he plays too rough for her and she does not put up with him. 

How do I break it to my parents I’m getting a kitten when they’ve made it very clear I’m “not allowed to?” I’m 20 years old and I have more than enough money saved to provide for this cat on my own. I don’t even live with them anymore and I don’t plan on ever moving back in. Any advice would be appreciated! 

TLDR ...
I am getting a kitten against my parents wishes. I am 20, and don’t know how to break it to them because they specifically told me no, but I don’t even live with them?"

This scares me because even things that have to do with safety goes in one ear and out the other. Like “get out of the street!” If he walks into the street in front of our house.

My wife and I are really struggling with this. I want to teach him life’s lessons as his father but the fact I can tell him anything or show him anything and he won’t listen ie. Therefore he does not learn.

Do any of you parents have any tricks or anything that was a game changer to your 4 or 5 year old or is this pretty normal for that age?

Also we take away all kinds of things, toys, iPad, etc when it comes to this and still he continues to do it.

Thx everyone for the help."
thingstodoinjersey	2021-04-18 03:46:40+00:00	Never Ending Nanny Issues!	"This is for parents who have experience with private nannies. As much as I hate it, I need help with childcare. I have a large family (including 3 littles who are not even school age yet), run a full time business, and my coparent travels for work about 70% of the year. I need the backup person to ensure my children are all getting the support and attention they need. 

My dream would be to find a long term nanny who would feel like a part of the family. We offer great pay and benefits (paid vacation, holiday bonus, double pay for any last minute or weekend shifts, lunches paid for, and more), and I do everything I can to make our home a positive work environment for them. 

No matter what I do, I keep getting the bad seeds. If you can think of a possible nanny problem, I have had it. I caught one sleeping when she was supposed to be watching my children. I’ve had to deal with caregivers ignoring the kids and scrolling their phone all day. More than once, I’ve had nannies who treat this like a volunteer position where they sort of just let me know when they’re going to show up. 

So, this is half rant and half plea for advice. If you’ve had success in developing a long-term relationship with a great nanny, how did you find them? What’s your screening process like? What do you offer to keep the good ones on board? Any guidance would be appreciated. 

I’m at my wit’s end, and I’m feeling so so guilty about the turnover my little ones are having to put up with. 

Thanks in advance. :)"
vvllll	2021-04-18 03:19:50+00:00	16 y/o is completely off the rails and does not respond to normal discipline	"I've had legal custody of my sixteen year old brother for a little over a year now. I've been responsible for him unofficially since he was a newborn, so this is not a new arrangement; it just happens to be the first period in our lives where the agreement has been on paper. In all but name, I am his parent. But I've never felt more at my wit's end raising him than I do right now. 

My brother was sexually exploited as a small child and it recently emerged that he has been abused repeatedly as an adolescent as well. This happened when he was in my care. I'm a failure as a parent and I know it, but I will do anything to pull this back and make it right. I cannot understand how I missed this, or how I could have failed him to this extent. I made efforts to search his devices wherever possible and took steps to discern where he has been going, and who he has been going out with, but it wasn't enough and I haven't been able to protect him. It has come as a shock; I thought we both were coping despite previous setbacks and our current arrangement was working for both of us.

He has grappled with depression and did have a slight relapse before Christmas; I believed substance abuse was to blame at the time. Aside from this, I presumed we were coping very well. We've been working alongside his social worker, he is in therapy, and generally, he has appeared more comfortable in himself. He has been managing his temper considerably well. He appeared to be dealing with the abuse coming to light with resilience. He cooperated with the police in giving an account of the abuse, and readily surrendered his devices. He has been attending therapy without arguments. He has been communicating with me when he felt overwhelmed. 

However, since returning to school almost two weeks ago, we've fought daily. He was attending online classes due to the pandemic, and he just returned to face-to-face learning. He performs adequately at school when he applies himself, but homework is a consistent battle. He insists that he'll finish it later, but later never comes. His workload got on top of him during online schooling and he has more to catch up on than he thought; yet he prioritises going out with friends, gaming, texting, or getting high. I have done everything in my power to counter this but it really is beyond my control at this stage, and considering the bigger picture, it seems petty that homework is the catalyst for our major disputes lately. 

As I type, he is spending the night at a friend's house having stormed out, again. I don't know which friend. I don't know where. I don't know what he is doing. He refuses to answer the phone or respond to texts. I called his social worker at 11; this is the agreed upon procedure when he violates curfew. Every time he fails to return home, they tell me they'll check back in the morning, and suggest I call the police if I can't make contact. 

But then what? He's sixteen and almost my size now. I can't restrain him. I can't force him to stay in the house. I can't force him to do anything, and I don't want to force him, I want to communicate with him. I can search his room, I can confiscate drugs, I can search his devices, I can switch off the WiFi when it's time to work or sleep. But it all infuriates him and he'll leave the house in a rage. Then I'll sit up all night sick to my stomach until I know he's alright. If I call the police, I know he might get confrontational with them and risk arrest. It wouldn't be the first time he's gotten into trouble.

He was sneaking out of our Father's house at night when he was twelve years old, and I've done all I can to combat it over the years. It was easy when he was small enough that I could put my arms around him and talk until he calmed down, but that really isn't an option anymore. 

I can't spend another night sitting up in fear that I'll get a phone call saying something has happened to him. I've been sick with stress and I'm starting to feel constantly unwell. My heartbeat is consistently irregular and I'm not even in my thirties. I love my brother more than life itself. I adore him. But I can't keep this up. I'm not enough for him, and I feel his issues are beyond my capabilities. I am terrified something will happen to him and I'll not be able to live with myself if it does. 

There are more concerns - I'm troubled about the material he consumes on the internet, for one. And both of our parents are attempting to re-establish contact with him. Both were abusive and the reason he is in my care. Our Father will likely be taking us to court for custody again soon. But these are problems I can't begin to tackle tonight. I'm overwhelmed - there are too many obstacles with this boy. I have two years left in which time I can legally do something to help him, but that time is running out fast. I love him deeply, but I feel out of my depth. He is completely off the rails, and I have no idea what to do. I've been parenting him since I was a child myself and I need help. Last time he was in foster care he felt rejected and our relationship was strained for months, but I feel I can't cope much longer, particularly if we keep taking these steps backwards in progress. 

What can I do? How can I help him? How can I establish normal boundaries when he has endured pain that is so beyond normal? He's a good kid when he isn't aggressive - he is thoughtful, kind, funny, intelligent, and deeply sensitive. I love him more than I've loved anyone or anything else in this life, but I can't continue like this."
LadyArty19	2021-04-18 03:16:49+00:00	Already worried &amp; we’re not even trying for baby #2 yet	"So one of my best talents is worrying about things I can’t control and stressing over future events that haven’t even happened yet. Yay me lol. Our daughter is almost 10mo and me and my husband know we want another child—we may start trying by next year at the earliest. I clearly enjoy motherhood enough to want another baby, but I’m already scared of how much more tired and overwhelmed I’ll be. I’m home with our daughter but I also work from home, so I’m nonstop all day long, and most days I’m pretty wiped out (mostly from work demands) and kinda testy to be honest. I remember how angry, exhausted and overwhelmed I was during our daughter’s first 3 months, and all I can think is, “If I was THAT burnt out, how will we survive with two?” I know there is zero reason for me to be worrying about it already, but I can’t help myself. If you have some words of wisdom or encouragement, please share. ❤️"
FancyPantsMead	2021-04-18 02:56:31+00:00	I feel I'm failing my son!	"My son is 15 and he's the sweetest kid. He's smart as hell. He's book smart, he's got some common sense, has a very good grasp on right and wrong, and empathy for others and helpful spirit. How am I failing him? 

To me it seems like he's so far behind in life skills. I hate that he has no drive to take care of his surroundings, he doesn't do his own laundry, doesn't do a full chore, doesn't cook, doesn't follow multi-step directions and has no umph to start things on his own. 

He's got chronic migraine just like me (I'm actually fully disabled because of how bad and frequent mine are and a severely bad back)  and there is definitely moments where I feel he takes advantage of it. 

He has excused absences at school. Because the number of days he's struck with them adds up to more then the 10 days he's allowed to miss per semester. He's still an A and B student. He makes his work up right away he doesn't bother the teachers by missing assignments or interrupting class to get caught up.

 He hates school with a passion. He hates the other students who he finds very immature and childish. He hates two of his teachers because they have said to him infront of the whole class ""oh my god (my son) has made it to school for a whole week in a row."" And make snide comments to him when he gets his make up stuff from them.


 Honestly it's the exact same shit I got from the teachers when I was going through school. I was top 10 in my class with honor classes, graduated early, and got scholarships and those jerks said the same thing to me. I had no parents to help me navigate the medical hell I was dealing with because I just wasn't that important to them.  I had to deal with it all myself. But I did.  

Now that my son is dealing with the same problems he is not going through it alone and I'm constantly involved. I chewed the teachers out hard and the staff but the damage is already done. Those teachers are jerks to him with passive agressive behavior.  My son has a 504 plan filed with the school. The only accomodations he requires is his attendance so I don't get thrown in jail for his absences. That's it. But it makes him hate school even more. 

He gets so upset if he doesn't do well on a test. He hates failure and when it happens he feels like it's anything and everyone fault but his own. Sometimes you have to study to get the grade. That's ok. But he's so used to everything coming natural to him and doesn't handle failure well. But in private. He doesn't make a scene infront of others. 

I feel like I haven't prepared him for the no's in life. How to get over adversity because he's never had any. I was/am so focused on giving him a better life then I had that I've never let him fail and figure it out on his own. And it's definitely time for him to start doing things like that. Watching him struggle with something because I've been doing it for him is killing me. Watching him fail at things he should have mastered long ago makes me feel like a complete failure.

My husband was raised the same way as our son and when we started dating and got married it astounded me the amount of life skills he just didn't have. My husband is 6 yrs older then me. My husband's attitude towards these things is that ""he'll figure it out!"" After all husband did.  So my husband's not worried about it at all, while I am constantly worried about how I messed this up for him. 

My husband just told me tonight while he and I were discussing it ""Wife, you've been a 35 yr old woman since you were 8, because you had to be. You had it all figured out for so long because no one took that burden off you and allowed you to be a kid, or a teenager. You've been a parent to your 3 siblings, made sure they were safe and cared for and didn't let anyone give them the same treatment as you. They turned out great. They got it. Even when you did more for them then you should have. They are well adjusted adults with good lives, yes they had times when they needed your help but that's what parents are for and that's what you are to them. Do you really think our son would have anything less in life with you as his mother? You're doing great. He's just being a teenager with a little too much chill. There is still time for him to learn the things you're scared he's lacking. He's got this. You've got him. He's gonna get it."" 


Honestly that was the nicest thing I've heard in a long time and didn't realize I'm not the only who thinks about his future. Who wants the best for him. With my chronic migraines I miss so much. So many things have to be canceled, or adjusted, or seriously thought out ahead of time. It's not that way for everyone and the amount of stress I have about life are very specific to my personal experiences. While my son may have some of my struggles he has so much more help and skills to deal with it then I did then. I need to help him but not overwhelm him, so he will get it too. It's just so hard to watch and not do. 

I love my son and husband so much and I only want the best possible life for them. All the things I never had, all the love and attention I was never shown and all the good things I never got. But, that looks very different from what I was thinking was lacking."

She tried to give me the $20 and said it was from the tooth fairy. I waited for her little sister to go to bed and then interrogated her.

Her life has been somewhat tough. Her mom is out of the picture and her step mom is very strict. Punishment lasts for a long time (nothing abusive just long times with out treats or privileges while seeing her sister get them). She begged me not to tell.

"I recently discovered adult nappies under my 17 year old sons bed when I went in his room to help find his phone (with permission). Next to the nappies was a small box that contained 3 adult pacifiers, a stuffed animal, and a sippy cup. 
I was obviously rather worried and so I called my son into the room. He came to the doorway and turned completely white and began to tear up. Which is strange considering he has never been much of a crier. I assured him I wasn’t mad and and asked what the stuff was for and why he had it. I had thought it was perhaps a kink thing but he denied that rather forcefully.

He told me that sometimes, when he is particularly stressed or overtired, he has trouble staying in an “adult” mindset and that it’s easier to slip into a younger one because he doesn’t have anything to worry about when he’s in a younger mindset. But he also told me that he usually doesn’t want to slip and that it’s simply involuntary, which is what really worried me. He said he’ll try to fight it. I have no idea what to do with this information. As far as I’m aware, there’s no major life changes that are particularly stressful. His father had suggested that perhaps it was for attention, but we both love him very much and have always given him attention when he needed it. Nothing new at school either. 

This was about a week ago and since then we’ve noticed all the signs of a child in our son. Caught him with his thumb in his mouth several times, found him washing his sheets after wetting the bed, etc. He was always so independent before and now that we know his secret, he can be clingy and whiny. Is this a mental disorder? Should we get him to see a therapist? I have no idea what to do at this point. Pleas help!"
mcbw2019	2021-04-18 01:57:36+00:00	Spent the whole day cleaning and organizing my 2 year old’s bedroom.	"It desperately needed it! He has so many toys, baby clothes in tubs, baby toys he’s outgrown, etc. and it was a full day project to go everything I had crammed in his walk in closet. We are saving most everything in case we are fortunate enough to have a second baby, but it definitely adds to the clutter in the house! 

His room is tidy now, but I am sitting on the couch feeling lousy for a few reasons. I think it made me really sad to pack up his baby things, changing pad, baby toysc, etc. he’s 2...I’ve been delaying it lol. I also am bummed because I didn’t enjoy my day off with him by doing anything fun, and I really cherish these weekend days together. I was busy pretty much all day while he self entertained. I also feel guilty because I snapped at him for climbing all over all the stuff on the floor and standing on it while I was trying to clean this afternoon. He didn’t care a kept on playing, but I felt bad for losing my temper, especially when it wasn’t even his fault that the room was such a mess. I did apologize and give him a hug and a kiss! Now the whole house is a mess from the bedroom declutter (big family who won’t stop buying toys lol), but his room is nice and tidy, everything is accessible, and his toys can be rotated. We did still play a bit and he played a lot in his room while I did the organizing. 

Someone tell me I’ll be glad I spent today doing this chore! Right now I feel like it was just a kind of crummy day."
THan0swasntwrong	2021-04-18 01:44:25+00:00	My partner wants to have a baby and I don’t know if I’m ready.	"I just don’t know if I’m ready. I’m not sure I will ever be ready. I like the idea of having children, when I was younger I always thought that’s something I’d like to do. But now as I approach the actual age to have kids, I’m less certain. 

I don’t like most children. I think they’re annoying. But I like the idea of having really young children, and then children who was old enough to be mature and bond with.  The in between scares me. Plus, a ton of kids have disciplinary issues with the newer generations being born in the modern technological world. Will my kids be ones I like? It’s supposed to be based on the parents, I know. But I’ve seen good parents get the raw end of the deal with children. 

I like having time to myself for my own hobbies. I like traveling with my partner. We have dogs, who also take up time and responsibilities. We do not have a lot of space in our home. We have family living with us and having a baby means they would have to leave. I don’t know how I feel about that either. I’m also worried about the supports we have in place with limited family. 

My partner really wants to have a baby. I want to make her happy and I like the idea of having a child. I think we need more space/money/time but don’t think those things are realistically changing within the next few years and the clock is ticking. 

I’m just stuck."
Darksxul666	2021-04-18 01:16:48+00:00	Help	I have a 7 month old who still sleeps in his bassinet. It’s not my decision whatsoever. My husbands parents are letting us live in their old house that my husband grew up in as long as we pay rent weekly. They’re also hoarders. They still haven’t gotten any of their stuff out of the baby’s room and he has begun to roll over a lot because he’s a very curious boy and I’m afraid of leaving him alone in his bassinet because I fear he might suffocate. They still won’t cooperate on getting their stuff out of this house. What do I do?
DyRight	2021-04-18 00:59:33+00:00	15 month old has been waking up at night and crying inconsolable for at least 30 minutes?	"It's been a week now. I've read about night terrors but I've also read that those are usually between 5 to 15 minutes. He's crying his lungs out, sometimes with his eyes opened but usually still tired and sleepy. 

He wasn't the best at sleeping since birth, but whenever he used to wake up, all it took was some water and he'd go back to sleep. Now he just wakes up, starts crying and nothing we do seems to help. 

What's the best thing to do and how do we find out what is actually bothering him?"

My son is a little over two years old and I will have to tell him tomorrow (it’s currently nighttime over here) or soon.

threwitaway1944	2021-04-18 00:44:58+00:00	Dealing with teens	"SO my daughter had a group over- 3 boys, 2 girls. I let them hang but kept popping my head in- like hey, how you guys doing? I asked that the keep the doors open or at least not shut completely. I said, ""I understand you guys want to kiss/cuddle but that's it!"" 

So I give them space, not too much, I thought. I mean there's 8 of them in a room right? I do one of my pop-ins and find 2 14yo girls with a 15 yo boy (the others ""gave them space""). Like may 15 min? 

So that girl is no longer allowed to come to my house because I am too permissive. Like since I'm ok with a boy kissing a girl now I think a threesome of 14yo is cool?  I'm super mad even though I don't really care to have the girl back. 

Kissing and cuddling is a normal activity at 14, threesomes is not"

Since he sees baby sister breastfeeding (I tell him baby sister is drinking milk) he has been asking to drink milk too, and will literally come at me open mouthed trying to pull my bra down. I have nothing against extended breastfeeding or tandem breastfeeding but he has not been breastfed since he was approx 10 months old, so I’m sure he doesn’t “remember” it himself. Is it weird to let him back on the breast and breastfeed again? I have given him a cup of expressed milk and of course he liked it and has made him want to more."
JMSidhe	2021-04-18 00:23:44+00:00	Single dad preparing for daughter's first period	"TL;DR - How can I best support my daughter during her first period?

I (M/29) have had custody of my kid (F/12) for ten years, she visits her mom on the weekends so it's a safe bet she'll be with me when she begins her first period. My nightmare is to be one of those awful parents who sends her alone into a pharmacy with $10, I've done my best to support her throughout her childhood and I want to continue to be someone she can lean on as she grows up. This is just the next challenge and I need to get out in front of it as best I can.

There aren't many other women in her life she could talk to besides my mother, and I don't know if that's a conversation they'd even be interested in trying. Either way it's not my mom's responsibility to talk to her granddaughter about these things. I know I'm working under a ticking clock and I want to be as supportive as I can. I want to see her pediatrician when it starts but I worry scheduling an appointment too soon would stress her out. She's slightly built (3'9"" and 62 pounds) and is a very soft kid who is scared of blood and broke down in tears when she learned she has to get vaccination shots this summer before starting middle school. Those are hurdles we'll have to work on.

I've begun my research and started making a shopping list, but still have a few questions. I'll try not to be too detailed. But I like making lists and plans. I keep an itinerary for vacations. Sorry in advance.

One book that's been highly recommended is ""The Care and Keeping of You 2: The Body Book for Older Girls,"" and I plan to order it, but I'd really appreciate any other reading materials to help both of us, but especially her considering it's her body going through these changes.

I've read that calcium and iron supplements can help in the days leading up to her period, and that painkillers like ibuprofen, paracetamol, and Modil can help with cramps pain (as opposed to Tylenol), but we'll be careful not to overuse them. Are there other pharmaceuticals I should stock up on? Dark chocolate is supposedly good for easing the pain, she loves it anyway so that's good, but if anyone can confirm or suggest other helpful snacks I'm all ears. We have a heating pad she sleeps on sometimes for comfort so that should help. I've seen a lot of references to keeping a hot water bottle but it's unclear to me what that's used for. What's up with the hot water bottle?

Padded period underwear is popular, with two brands mentioned a lot: Thinx and Bambody. But what are the pros/cons? Which would you recommend?

Knixteen overnight shorts and Kotex U overnight pads are both popular. Would it be overkill to use them together or is this an either/or situation? I put a plastic liner on her mattress already and I know how to remove bloodstains with hydrogen peroxide. Are pantyliners an overnight thing, and what brands are best?

I don't think she'll be ready for tampons but what do I know, I'm no expert. I have read that Platex Sport are best for kids her age but I'm open to suggestions. She goes swimming in our pool often during the summer, is that an issue? Can she swim with pads or do we need tampons?

Additionally, and this is more difficult: I know we'll have the safe sex and consent talk, but I don't know how to bring up that she is a product of two teenagers not practicing safe sex. I don't want her to think that she was an accident or unwanted. It feels like it will inevitably come up. It's something I plan to speak to a therapist about once I find one who accepts my insurance (among other personal issues) but in the meantime I have no idea how to discuss this. Any input would be appreciated.

Thank you for reading this far, that was a lot to spit out but I've been worrying about this lately and can't afford to procrastinate. I have to do right by my kid and I don't have enough answers right now to do that. Thank you for your help."
underwearfanatic	2021-04-18 00:05:15+00:00	Waking up a terrorist	"My daughter (3yr) has been a terrible sleeper both for naps and at night. Reports from daycare are that she naps well there.

On the weekends she pretty much refuses to nap. And when she finally crashes (on the couch) she sleeps for about 1hr.

However when she wakes up she is an absolute terrorist. Kicking, screaming, flailing, and crying. If you talk to her she screams louder. If you get near her then she will try to kick you.

Read online that it is because she will have low blood sugar upon waking. However when she wakes she is normally so irate that she wont eat. She does eat poorly at home (quantity and quality) as she pretty much refuses to eat in general.

Thoughts?"
camelCaseSpace	2021-04-17 23:57:40+00:00	Can somebody help me with the whole no spanking recommendations?	"I have read the research and have learned a lot about peaceful/positive parenting. But I feel as though I'm not convinced that it actually works.

And my group of friends I was one of the last children. And 5/8 of them don't spank and 3 of them do. And none of the kids who don't get spanked behave while all of the kids who do get spanked behave.

And I have tried it with my children also. We have not spanked them and they are very unruly. And this is just me venting my frustration about this. I feel like this research is like the research that says that you shouldn't stretch before you run. But as a collegiate athlete who ran track I stretched before I ran from middle school to my senior year in college and I was a dang good runner.

I'm at a loss here. I don't disbelieve the extremes that can come from spanking. But when I look at my kids and my friend's kids who don't spank I'm starting to believe that this is another extreme to not spank at all."
june_a	2021-04-17 23:53:52+00:00	Would it look weird if a couple offers to babysit other people's children for free?	"Me and my husband are thinking of becoming parents, but last time we interacted with a real human child was 10+ years ago. So we have no clue how it feels to be around a kid. We came up with an idea to try to work as babysitters on weekends, but do it for free, just to get some experience and figure out if we are able to handle a child.   
Now I'm wondering, wouldn't that look suspicious? Usually babysitters are students who need some extra money, and we both are in late 20s and working. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I'm afraid that people will think we are pedophiles or something of the kind and simply won't trust us with their children. 

So I have a question for parents: Would you even consider leaving a kid for a day with a young married couple, if they provide this explanation (that they want to get experience before having own children)? Or would you think it's too weird?"

"I just left my very narcissistic ex this year, and we have joint custody, and he gets her every thursday night, and every other weekend. I am the primary carer, and she stays with me.

My little girl is 18 month old, and is very inquisitive, positive, bright and just a joy to be around.

My ex is not the healthiest of people, and I am very worried he will inflict trauma (intentionally or otherwise) on the child. Of course, I can't prove any of this, and won't be able to while she's a child. But that's not really my question.

My question and hope for guidance, is that I am thinking of not working for a year, at least until she's 3 years old, and starts talking and understanding things. 

During her entire childhood thus far, I was made to not work, to be a stay at home mom, and forsake my career and everything which made me me.

However, I have just been offered a $80,000 a year job at a tech company.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I take the job, see my child less, or should I not work for another year, and focus fully on her development?

Any advice?"
Atticus1981	2021-04-17 23:14:59+00:00	Parenting My Bipolar Mom	"I’ve been involuntarily parenting my mom since I was about 12 or so. I’m now 40. Today is a hard day. She gets manic. Sometimes the highs send her into aggressive self harming mode. The really fun part is that she will engage in risky behavior that eventually includes doing meth which negates her medication, then she will spiral into a dark place where she bangs her head into walls, sliding glass doors and onto concrete flooring, etc.. Like a self destructing zombie of some sort. The next turn in this cycle is that she genuinely seems to believe someone else has harmed her. So she will accuse (nurses, police, doctors, family members, friends, strangers) of inflicting injury on her.   She is actually the aggressor. She physically assaults anyone around. I moved far away, long ago, but still text and talk. Right now she has spiraled all the way into the self harm and accusation part. She tried to get my brother arrested today after he found her with a head injury... but she ended up assaulting the police. Now I’m praying she ends up at the hospital for a little regulation. Also that her eight small dogs that she keeps letting run free near the highway survive this episode. It’s basically like parenting a very unstable teen going through their darkest hardest part of life... but forever.. When she is like this I get physically ill and can’t really function. Not only am I triggered about past trauma when she is like this, I just feel so helpless. Note: all I can do is call for a police well check and let her doctor know what’s going on. And put my phone on silent as her texts and calls about the rapture and other wildly delusional things pour in hour after hour."

We have tried famotadine. We have tried nutramigen. We got the Dr. Browns bottles. 

Now we are on Puramino formula (2 weeks ago) and have just started lansoprazole (day 3 so far). There was a slight improvement when we started Puramino 2 weeks back but now we are back to bad news baby. Constant straining, flexing, back arching, grunting...never sleeps. Best sleep shes had is 3 hours. It was a miracle. Typically 1 hr max sleeps. Never sleeps during day. But the thing is she doesn't vomit or spit up which I hear is a clear sign of reflux. Also there's no blood or mucus in her stool so dairy allergy is not definite. So many questions about what's wrong its driving me nuts. Is it just bad gas?? All the time?????

I want to jump off a bridge (kidding...sorta). We have a 3 year old who also needs us. Not sleeping is destroying us. And I'm the husband! My wife is pulling the heavy weight...shes really struggling...

Skandranonsg	2021-04-17 22:23:41+00:00	How BDSM made me a better parent today. (SFW)	"You might be thinking something along the lines of ""My kids were being annoying today so I tied them up in the basement"", but I promise this post is all wholesome.

My daughter (9) has pretty severe anxiety and is likely ASD. She doesn't generally like thrills and gets trepidatious see at the idea of being pushed too high on the swing. As a parent, I feel like it's my responsibility to push her boundaries in a safe way without making her feel uncomfortable.

I'm sure you've all heard about the idea of [safe words](https://youtu.be/QxCpBSDiPNc), but there's a really cool age appropriate version many aren't familiar with. The aptly named ""stoplight"" system is very easy for young ones to understand and express their needs quickly and in language they understand. **Green** means ""I'm having fun, don't stop"", **Yellow** means ""In not ready to stop, but I'm uncomfortable"", and **Red** means ""I need to stop right now"". The most important part of the stoplight system is that it creates a constant line of communication so you can keep a gauge of each other's mental state, which builds trust and rapport.

I taught her the stoplight system while pushing her on the swing. She was able to communicate with me through greens and yellows when she was feeling uncomfortable and when she wanted to be pushed higher. For the first time in her entire life I was able to build enough confidence in her to push her so high that her butt left the seat, and I was rewarded with the biggest, heartiest giggles ever."
MEd_Mama_	2021-04-17 22:10:54+00:00	How did your baby transition completely to solids?	"TL;DR- can you walk me through how your baby transitioned completely to solids?

My 8 month old son is eating about 2-3 servings of solids a day, in addition to about 2-3 breast milk feedings or bottles. I’ve done a lot of research and I know that breast milk should continue to be a part of his diet until he is 1, but I am struggling. He prefers solids over breast milk and is slowly but surely starting to refuse the breast. 

I am conflicted because I know that he needs to eat solids to get experience with them and also because breast milk no longer provides all the nutrients he needs. Based on this, I don’t want to take out the solids. However, I also don’t want to transition him all the way to solids because he is not yet 1 year. An added problem is that my milk supply is starting to go down because I’m not nursing as much as I used to, but I can’t really pump easily at my job (I’m a teacher). I don’t think that low supply is why baby is refusing the breast because he also is refusing full bottles as well. 

Most of what I’ve researched has just been “oh baby should drink this much milk and have this many servings of food” but nothing I can find really explains HOW the transition from milk to solids works or WHAT that can potentially look like. Plus... I’m a FTM so I am already kind of clueless. 

Hence, I’m turning to this great community. What did the transition from milk to only solids look like for you? What do you recommend? I will ask baby’s pediatrician at his 9 month appointment, but I wanted to see what you all thought first. 

Thanks in advance all you wonderful parents!"
Wondahwall	2021-04-17 22:09:54+00:00	We hacked the “no” phase!	"We knew it was coming, but around 22 months, the word “no” started appearing with increasing frequency in our son’s vocabulary and, within less than a month, it seemed like we were doomed to a life of frustration for the foreseeable future. 

... Until we found a hack, a very weird way to embrace the « no » and take its power away!! 

It works every single time, and has for a solid month and a half, so I’m sharing in case anyone else’s kid came with that software patch as well. It goes like this: 

Us: Hey kiddo! It’s time to change your dia-

The Antagonist: no!

Us: it’s time to change your diape-no! Let’s go to your room-no! togeth-no! 


*surprised confusion, met by us looking at him like we just said something completely normal*


The Antagonist: let’s go-no! 
*walks to his room merrily* 


***


We keep it up until he’s laughing and collaborates, sometimes as long as it takes to take off his pants-no! and remov-no! his diape-no! but it works. 

And, more than anything else, it turns potential frustration into silliness, which is a win in our book. :)

This is all normal and sane, right?"

We tried famotadine and got off breastmilk. Initially that helped a bit but shes now become worse. Currently we are on Puramino formula (for 2 weeks now)and she's been taking Lansoprazole for 3 days now. Still no improvement...yet.

We are at our wits end as to what is going on with her. Here are some symptoms:

- Constant squirming, flexing, straining, back arching
- Has trouble burping
- Does not sleep well at all. Our best has been 3 hours. Typically 1 hour. Does not sleep during day
- no spit up or vomit
- lots of crying
- needs to be held constantly
- prefers belly laying vs. Back

My wife is grasping to hope that it isn't reflux as she misses breastfeeding dearly. I am pretty sure its some sort of allergy or reflux...or something! Lack of sleep plus not knowing what's wrong is driving us mad.

Any advice? Similar experiences? Will the lansoprazole kick in and help soon??"
volderpuss	2021-04-17 21:23:54+00:00	Montessori made me feel like my 2 year old needs interventions.	"My 27 month old daughter started Montessori this week. She was in in-home daycare before that but when the school told us they had a spot open in their 2 year old classroom we jumped on it. We got an update call the first day, Monday, to let us know she was having trouble being redirected and would scream and cry when told to stop doing something. Tuesday wasn’t much better, the teacher said she “only cried when I told her not to climb under the slide”. Wednesday she bumped her head on a shelf. Thursday, she played in the toilet and got pee on her (she has NEVER shown interest in playing in the toilet at home). We’ve been working on stopping the screaming behavior (we chalked it up to typical 2 year old boundary pushing) at home. We also have tried putting away a lot of her toys and leaving a few out only. 

We had an update meeting on Friday. The director and teacher mentioned they have to tail her to make sure she’s listening to directions and not climbing on stuff. I feel like they pretty much told me I have a child raised by wolves, and I must be seeing something completely opposite at home? I also feel like they wanted me to have her completely ready for some school setting before she even got into the school, as if I was supposed to emulate it at home? We’ve adopted the Montessori approach, maybe not to a T like they do at school but it honestly felt like they had “BEHAVIORAL EVALUATIONS” on the tip of their tongue. She’s 2. NEWLY 2. Did I miss some crucial teaching moments or are these some kind of unrealistic expectations for a child in their first week of school?"

But generally speaking, if a couple you're friends with announces that they're having a childfree wedding and you're invited, what do you think about that? Would you expect something of the soon to be married couple (e.g. paid childcare)? Would you be upset, because you see your kids as an extension of your and your spouse and your kids are not invited? On the opposite, would you be glad about it because you can enjoy an afternoon/evening without worrying about your kids? Thank you for any input, I'm very curious!"
Litterboxbonanza	2021-04-17 20:49:11+00:00	My 4 year old daughter nagged me about watching The Lord Of The Rings...	"My daughter is really interested in trees at the moment and last week, I told her about a story I know of where there are walking and talking trees. A week of her nagging me to watch LOTR and I'm super-glad that I gave in because she absolutely loved it. 

Before you all begin filleting my parenting, yes I did censor it well. We started at The Two Towers because I felt like she needed some action at the start to get her hooked into it. She loved seeing a wizard fight a fire monster. My kid was ALL about it. Made me so damn proud as a dad. 

All together, after my censoring it made TTT about 1 hour and 50 minutes. She loved every minute of it.

This was yesterday. Today she asked what happens next. I said, ""the creepy fella tricks them into a giant spiders house"" ""😯"". So we watched TROTK and again, she was so enveloped. I thought I was gonna save this for when she was a teenager, but... Oh well. I watched Jaws when I was 4 and I turned out ***FINE!!!***"

It’s funny he won’t eat any of the food from our culture. His go to is cheese and crackers, soup, and other finger foods. Thank goodness he loves fresh fruit. I guess I’m looking for stories... not advice per se. I know not to give up on trying new foods, not to bribe him, and not to scold him (although sometimes I get a little miffed when he sucks the sauce off his chicken and spits out the meat or throws his stew on the ground because he didn’t like it). I have this irrational fear that he’s starving all of the time even though he’s in the 100 percentile for height and 50 percentile for weight (he is tall and skinny like his dad). Doctor is unconcerned but I’m still worried. Looking to hear from parents with similar experiences!"

We sell wooden doll strollers which I always store on the top shelf backwards (handle facing away from the aisle.) This usually works very well. Kids can’t reach them, and since the handle isn’t sticking out, they often don’t even recognize what it is from their level. So they don’t get damaged.

UNLESS 

Unless some parent wants to know how cute their toddler would look pushing it along and filling it up with things they don’t ever intend to buy. Then they just abandon it in the middle of an aisle when their toddler is distracted so as to avoid a meltdown when they take it away. 

How about just don’t?"

My oldest just turned 6 in March, our second 3 a week ago and our youngest 1 on April Fools. I don't even know what to do anymore. To be honest, 2 kids was easy. It was a breeze. Our second is so mild and easy outside of the typical 2 year old screams, that it really was hardly like even adding a kid to the bunch... but now? Our oldest and middle kid fight constantly yet also play constantly and love each other tons... our youngest is attached to me by the hip and gets into EVERYTHING. I can't even vacuum or do the dishes without having to break up fights, stop them from tearing up the house or stop my youngest from getting into everything and anything or pulling on my pants and crying for me. I feel so overwhelmed and like I can't take proper care of them (like styling my oldest daughter's hair or spending proper time with my 3y/o son) and forget taking care of myself; I can barely shower even with my mother in law helping us watch them because my youngest screams for me the entire time while I'm in there and ends up banging on the bathroom door... can't even put on my moisturizer. 

How do people juggle it? I feel so lost and I feel like it's causing more fights between my spouse and I because the house is total chaos all the time, and so of course we are always on edge and annoyed a good chunk of the time.

Fox_the_foxy	2021-04-17 19:43:27+00:00	Question for other parents out there	"I have a son and a daughter, he is 16 and she is 17, and sometimes I find myself looking at one of them for a minute or so and thinking: ""This shit is so surreal. How the hell does he/she even exist."" In response I receive the usual ""I didn't do it"" or ""what happened?"" or even ""I was in my room the whole time"". Sometimes they think I'm looking because I already know what they did and actually confess doing things I had no knowledge about.

When I asked my wife if she feels the same, she thought I was joking and laughed. When I said I wasn't joking, she laughed harder. When she sees me looking at them like this, she laughs after she sees whether they are going to confess doing something or not. With time I also started laughing, but still have this weird feeling.

Curiously enough, one of them came to me once and asked ""why mom laughs so much?"".

Does any parent also feel or have felt like this? Creating another person and looking at them... it just feels weird to me sometimes."

Poctah	2021-04-17 19:01:10+00:00	Any gymnastics parents? Need some advice.	"My daughter has been doing gymnastics since 2. She started doing one class a week 45 mins long. Now at 5 she’s at level 3 and does 2 hours a week for gymnastics and a hour for tumbling(so 3 days a week, 1 hour each session). She has really excelled and is amazing at gymnastics(her class is full of kids who are 8-10 and she’s hands down the best). Anyways where she goes to gymnastics now they don’t do competitive and it’s more for fun and learning basics. She basically has outgrown the program. The studio she attends also owns another gymnastics studio down the road that does do competitive and is very hard to get into(invite only and they only take the best of the best). My daughter has been offered a spot on the team in level 3 once she turns 6 in June. Now the catch they require 12 hours a week. Monday and Wednesday are 5:30pm-8:30pm and sat is 7:30am-10:30am. Is this normal? It seems like a shit ton of hours for a 6 year old. I also am worried about her being overtired for school(she usually goes to bed by 7pm and wakes at 7am). Anyways I don’t want to miss a great opportunity but I want to make sure I don’t over stress her or have her hurt herself. She really wants to do it though. Thanks for advice!"
peepeepoopoobutt123	2021-04-17 18:52:20+00:00	"12 year old is a giant slob, is this normal?"	"Like we keep trying to enforce cleanliness - we set examples, have clean day, make him clean his room, do chores like take the trash out.  

However the degree of sloppiness is just insane if we don’t constantly monitor him (like legit have to check his room weekly).  Like we have found chewed up gum in random crevices in the apartment, not even wrapped up.  He refuses to throw his clothes in the hamper even though we put a hamper right in his room.  Like he throws it RIGHT NEXT to it??  There is also food wrappers in his room and old half eaten food.

Is this just normal 12 year old behavior?  I don’t recall being this lazy/sloppy at that age.  It’s just mentally exhausting that we give him rules like no snacks in the room and he just sneaks them in there.

He spends half the time at his moms if that matters."
cibman	2021-04-17 18:50:57+00:00	"Just a rant, “shame on you!”"	"Just a rant because the horse has already left the barn on this one.

We have my MIL being a granny nanny (something that I was worried about) and one day she said “shame on you!” when our daughter misbehaved. Of course this was the term she picked up on and now she uses it whenever she’s upset with something someone does.

I am annoyed beyond belief by this, especially as she gets back to school because I don’t want her shaming anyone.

What was even more annoying is that the MIL didn’t even admit it was her to start with! Eventually she did cop to it and so I have her lying to me.

Fortunately this fall is kindergarten and goodbye to her being our nanny."
lmaru0330	2021-04-17 18:32:24+00:00	Fighting during nap time	"Just need some insight here from parents of older toddlers. My son is 2 next month. He has been on the same schedule for the last 12 months; 0830 wake up, 1230 nap time, 2030 bedtime. He sleeps in his own bed for both nap time and bedtime. This last week or so, maybe week and a half, he has been terrible to put down for a nap and bed. He fights, rolls, screams, etc. for 20 minutes- 1 hour before he finally settles down. Once he settles down, he is usually asleep within 15-20 minutes which is how long it usually takes without all the fighting. We read to him for 15-20 minutes before he lays down as well. Some nights it’s taken my wife nearly 2 1/2 hours to put him down for bedtime. While he seems tired around 1130-12, he’s up until 1300-1400 fighting us before laying down and napping for 2-3hrs. I’m wondering if you think it’s time to take away the nap and maybe opt for an earlier bedtime ex: 1930 instead of 2030? Or maybe an earlier nap? We are kind of stumped because while he seems like he needs the nap, we don’t really have time to sit with him for hours rocking, holding, bouncing, etc. waiting for him to fall asleep as we have a 3 week old as well that needs tending too. Any input is appreciated. Thanks."
WeirdMuffins	2021-04-17 18:13:09+00:00	Let Them Play	"I took my 3yr old son to target with me and agreed that if he was good and patient with me he could get two toys. I was finally done shopping so I took him around to the toy aisle. While there he was so excited and wanted a barbie toy, she's got long red hair and wearing yoga clothing but he wanted it so I put it in our basket. I've always let my kid choose what he wants to wear or wants to play with and he loves dolls so nothing new. We kept walking and for the first time he saw a batman toy that comes with Bane and he has the equal amount of love and obsession over it. Yeah that's technically 3 toys but 2 of them came in the same box and I have a massive soft spot for batman. So in the end he got his barbie, batman and bane. The three Bs. My mother was a little put off by his choices but I've made it clear that I don't care what he plays with as long as its age appropriate. 
If he likes having his nails painted as batman dances with yoga barbie then fine. No harm done at all and it's cute seeing him express himself. So even if you're not sure how this will turn out just let them play. They're kids and don't care about labels."
Mitskislut	2021-04-17 18:13:06+00:00	How do I guard internet access without making him sneakier?	"I feel I have to explain our relationship first, he's almost 10 and I have an 8 year age gap with him, i'm aware I've been parentified to an extent. I look after him daily, but with the passage of time I've also kinda become his guardian online as my parents are not the most tech savvy. I've been clumsy with my approach to internet safety before, mostly out of paranoia as I've come to realize how harmful the internet was to me as a child, as i was certainly exposed to things i shouldn't have and i was taken advantage of multiple times.

This morning he got logged out of his Roblox account, it was a messy recovery but I was able to successfully log him in, in a process that included me logging in on my laptop. When I gave him his tablet with his account on, literally a minute afterwards, i saw he DMd a person, when i went to look at his DMs i noticed he's been talking to people daily for months.

The person he was chatting to is clearly not his age and instructed him to change his password and activate 2 step verification due to a recent wave of hackings last night so i assume that's why he got logged out today, this person also advised him about downloading stuff prior (Google chrome, and in a legit way, no spooky trojan afaik), it's nothing specific or outwardly malicious, but this leads me to believe that if someone instructed him to change his login info or download something with bad intentions, he would easily listen to them. It's my mistake but i never thought about looking into his Roblox because I've had multiple sit downs with him about safety on the internet, and I thought Roblox was safe enough, without taking into account it's a system that can be easily obsolete if you know your way around him, which most users do.

As i kept going down his DMs, it reminded me of the naivety i once had online that made me so easily fooled before, he seriously acts like a child, and he is, and i was stupid to think that he would behave any other way. I've turned everything about chatting off on his account so he can purely play for now and i will be more strict on his screen time and internet access, but as someone that knows what it's like to be a child and be so invested on the internet as your form of escapism, i feel it's only a matter of time before he becomes sneakier, i know once you get a taste of that sweet sweet internet freedom at age 10, if you suddenly get restrictions you'll long for that power trip again and make regretful decisions, been there. So how do i go about this aside giving him a talk? Am I overreacting because of what happened to me? I'm honestly at a loss right now."

Just a few examples with my 4.5 year old:
-He got really upset that we were getting a new couch. His sadness was palpable as the guys carried the old one out to the junk truck.
-The other day he finally seemed ready to take our Valentine hearts garland down and put up the flowers garland. He even helped me switch them out. Then moments later he was teary and getting choked up and asked can we please put the hearts back? 
-He still won’t let us change the side of his crib to a “toddler bed.” Luckily he’s fine to go all night without needing the potty.

Anyone go through something similar?"
AccidentalCornDog	2021-04-17 17:12:47+00:00	"Please help, she is driving us CRAZY!"	"We have a beautiful 27 month-old toddler. She is really a great kiddo, but she has a habit that is just getting worse, rather than going away as others have said it would. She gets angry and throws tantrums when people laugh! Now, keep in mind, she is fine if you are laughing at her or with her, but seemingly can’t stand it if she’s not “in on the joke” for lack of a better phrase. It used to be only an issue if my husband and I laughed about something to each other, but now she even gets mad if my coworkers laugh during a Zoom meeting. She will throw things and go into a tearful meltdown. She is apparently not on the Autism spectrum, and really no other noises seem to get this reaction aside from when our dog is howling.

Just as an example today he was outside and screaming (happily) and beginning to play aggressively. The situation began bothering the neighbours, myself, and our other kids. I calmly asked him to come into the house and count his fingers to 10 or “blow out the candle” on his finger so he could calm down. He flat out would refuse and I did say well we can’t go outside until we can play nicely and calmly. I suggested it’s a good time to have a break or play some toys in the basement and once he was feeling better we could go back to playing outside again. He began to say he was going to break things in the house and continued to get more upset. He started following our 3 year old around and pushing him and wouldn’t leave him alone. I held his hand and walked to to his room with him and said he needed to have a break until he could treat everyone nicely and the way they deserved. He would not stay in his room or the play area and would continue to come out and started to walk up against me and began pushing me. I told him I was starting to get mad and I needed space at that point as well. This all went on for an hour and I just couldn’t handle it anymore and I began yelling and at that point he did listen. I just don’t want to yell, I know it isn’t good and not healthy. I just am at a loss. 

He is seeing a psychologist and we have tried the things she suggested, most of the time he refuses to do them. He is also seeing a psychiatrist as well.

Any advice is so much appreciated"

Sootea	2021-04-17 16:51:08+00:00	Need advice with childcare situation	"I'd appreciate any guidance and advice I could get!

I'm a first time mom. I have no family to rely on locally and neither does my husband. I work from home due to Covid and took care of my baby girl ever since she was born (she's now 9 months). My workplace is now asking us to return to work starting in August for only one a day. Now I've found myself needing child care and have no clue what to expect at all. My coworkers who had children never hired any (they have large families). My mother also worked from home and raised us. 

Now, I understand that a once a week childcare situation is not very appealing. Day cares probably want a full time enrollee and nannies are probably booked as a full-timer too... For one day a week,   
would you put your baby in daycare, in-home daycare or hire a nanny?

What should I expect from each situation? In light of Covid, would it be unreasonable if I ask my nanny to wear a mask when working?

I have 3 months to look for something... is this enough time? I hear about long wait lists for day cares which I never would have imagined it could take so long. I'm also afraid that my baby will end up with a cold hearted and neglectful provider... My company contracts care services for vulnerable individuals and the complaints I hear are terrible. 

Thanks in advance."

He, alongside my parents, has been at home for the last year. Prior to this, he would not use these words as he did not know them but he was still somewhat physical at times, which was not a big problem. Over the past year with my dad being home, my brother has picked up on his habits of swearing, being angry, and being aggressive in his play. My father has become better but he is still far from perfect. My mum and I try our best to model good behaviour for him but my father seems to just ruin our progress, which has been really frustrating. Right now he only uses bad words when he's angry and he understands that none of them are actual words/words others will understand. He still has not stopped and doesn't seem like he's going to forget them anytime soon so I would appreciate any advice. With the issue of being physical, my father will come to spend 5 min with my brother and get him very energized and aggressive and then leave, a thing that he continues to do. We've told him continuously to stop but my father does not listen. The problem is my father's influence and that will be fixed in the next year, but for now, are there any tips or tricks to help my brother?"

We did a sneakpeek at 11W in clinic/sterile setting and girl result. I have my hesitation on my wife getting excited about girl until we get ultrasound confirm (even though it is probably correct). I think she would be destroyed if it flips.

Baby girls seem intimidating when I think about how relatively easy the boys have been. It's hard for me to even think about how the girl is going to interact in the house and even how to handle a baby girl. We are in full boy mode so this is a shock to the system.

I listened to yet another parent today, talking abput the court process they're going through just to get to see their kid at all.

It happens far too often. Every time I hear it I respond by hugging my kids just a little bit tighter because a quick decision is the only difference between my situation and theirs.

It makes me so angry! My ex was abusive and manipulative but I have never stopped him seeing his kids (I just forced a condition that I'm always present when he does). I'm one of those who has every right to stop visits but I don't because my KIDS have a right to know their father.

It sickens me that so many parents put themselves first and make the kids suffer to get back at an ex.

How do these people sleep at night???

It happens to women as well, not just men. And men often are not deadbeats, they desperately want to see their kids but can't.

SwarlyNotBarney	2021-04-17 14:17:42+00:00	Who is wrong in this situation	"So I’m going to make this post trying to be completely unbiased although it may become apparent which parent I am. Who is in the wrong?

The mother in this equation has raised two children on her own for 8 years. Constantly asked the father for financial support to which he would seldom help out. She tried to put him on child support for years and we would always avoid it. The mother didn’t have much of a support system and was never able to finish college due to working full time jobs. Mom agreed to send the children to live with dad for a year and a half so she could get back on her feet. 

The father in this equation has had primary custody of the children for three years (not the mom’s choice. She agreed to a year and a half remember). He makes very good money and supports the children well. He asks the mother for nothing and says the children are well taken care of but still expects her to give him child support. The mother has refused because she says he should be paying her child support and if they children have everything they want and need, there’s nothing for her to do. 

Is Dad wrong for asking for child support after deliberately avoiding it for so long and flashing his great life in mom’s face? Or is mom wrong for not ever getting her shit straight so she could pay child support?

Also just for reference, there is a court order that says mom pays no child support and the children don’t bring clothes etc to visits with mom."
kratosbatman	2021-04-17 13:52:30+00:00	Toddler sleep advice	"Need help with getting my daughter 20 months to go back to bed. 

My daughter is usually a perfect sleeper so I’m very blessed and thankful for that. We have no problem at nap time and at initial bed time. Nap time there’s no routine we just put her down and she goes to sleep.
Bed time it’s bath 1 book round of kisses and hugs and we put her down and she’s good. 

Even if she doesn’t fall asleep right away she lays there quietly until she does. All great! That’s not my issue. 

Our issue comes is if something wakes her up in the middle of the night. Be it the dog deciding that she must catch the possum in the back yard and bark right outside her window, night mare, what ever. If she wakes up In the middle of the night she will not go back to bed in her crib. 

We tried cry it out but not a huge fan so that last like two rounds if at all and we end up bringing her to bed with us. And she falls right back to sleep in our bed, But if we try to move her then she wakes right back up and we start all over. We never co-slept with her before the 15 month mark. Before that giving her a bottle when we were having a particularly hard time going back to bed always did the trick. She’s not a particular big fan of milk any more these days so I can’t give her a cup of that but we’ve tried water and it’s not the same. 

Her sleeping in our bed isn’t ideal she’s a squirmy little bugger and rolls around and effects our quality of sleep also we’ve haves some close calls where she’s almost rolled over one of us and off the bed before. 

Everything online is about toddler transitioning into big kid beds and 95%of the time I have no issues with her in her crib. And I have no issues with her going back to sleep in my bed, Literally we put her down and shes out as long we don’t pick her up again to move. 

The only thing that makes her upset after waking up is the crib and that’s the only time the crib is an issue."

Now I am a parent and my kids toys are devouring batteries and I am wondering if other parents tend to use rechargeable batteries or at what point did they switch.

My kids are 2 year old and 3 1/2 year old"
Whythebigpaws	2021-04-17 13:35:39+00:00	Challenging my preconceived notions of what works....	"I've always been so proud of how my eldest was riding a pedal bike, without any supports, by the age of 3. He was on a balance bike from the age of 20 months and learnt to use a pedal bike within 20 minutes of first trying. I was so smug about it and have always believed his brilliant bicycling is down to my amazing parenting and use of balance bikes.
Along comes child number two. Terrified of the bicycle. I have tried countless times to get him on the balance bike to no avail. He is 5 and a half and cannot/will not ride a bike. My husband gently suggested stabilisers which I promptly poo pooed, because I have been so convinced of my methods with my eldest. However, we bit the bullet and finally put stabilisers on his bike. He is now happily cycling round the park and is very proud of himself.
The lesson my youngest child repeatedly shows me, is that whatever worked, or didn't work for my eldest, may not necessarily be the case for him . Parenting is a never ending journey of finding out how different they can be. I do my best parenting when I put my preconceived notions about what does and doesn't work to one side, and focus instead on the child in front of me."
kayshea1689	2021-04-17 13:21:27+00:00	Thumb sucker	My 6 month old is a thumb sucker. Just recently he started to refuse the pacifier and not allow me to rock him to sleep. He is bottle fed. I need advice on getting him to use a pacifier. We have a few flights coming up and my guy is soooo loud when he’s fussy and he fights sleep fiercely. It’s also hard when we are out to dinner or anywhere other than home and he’s tired and I can’t console him. Any tips on helping him be more comfortable with sleeping in my arms and especially with taking a pacifier. I’ve tried many brands.

Literally every time I find a job that seems perfect, I realize the hours won’t work out. My husband already has to deal with overnight calls and often works 12-14 hours a day. His schedule changes every week. I don’t know how I’m ever supposed to get a job and this is really depressing me. We don’t have reliable parents and I’m afraid of hiring nannies that won’t be reliable either. How do you deal with this? Has it worked out with a full time nanny? Have you found your dream jobs?"

MsKatD	2021-04-17 09:58:37+00:00	Children’s residential homes	"Hi! I’m really sorry, I tried to find a subreddit that was more appropriate for my question but I’ve struggled so I’ll pop it here as it does sort of relate.

I have a student in my year 7 class who, through no fault of his own, is in the care system. I won’t go into detail but quite recently, his foster placement broke down and he’s now in a children’s residential home.

He’s a wonderful boy. He struggles, emotionally; there are a lot of triggers for him which mean he needs to remove himself from lessons to cool down, etc, he can be be calm one moment and flipping tables upside down the next, his anger can escalate extremely quickly, even from something like another student talking about their parents, which is a completely normal conversation but, for the student in care, it upsets him; I do understand why - he’s had an unsettled life, and we are continuously working on ways to manage his feelings, but of course, we can’t erase memories of trauma he’s been through. 

What I’m really asking is: what is life in a children’s home like? I don’t want to ask him about the details because I don’t want this to be a trigger and bring on negative feelings for him, but for example, my own children get a story at bedtime, unlimited cuddles, 1:1 time with me, and so on. Does this happen in a children’s residential care home too? I feel that emotionally, children really need this, and I worry all the time that my student doesn’t have these sort of things available. 

Can anyone enlighten me?"
stillformodesty	2021-04-17 09:56:58+00:00	My(25F) dad just accidentally saw my tattoos and I feel so bad that we're not talking.	"Idk if this is the right sub. But I might as well just share and maybe get a couple advices.

I have 2 older brothers who are also heavily tatted. I have always been so fascinated about getting them ever since I saw my elder brother come back home with 2 full sleeves. Since then, I always had it in mind that I will get tattoos too since I loved art so much as well. I saved up enough money every time and spent them on getting tattoos. Needless to say, both my brothers have really influenced me with my interests in life.

I'm more close with my mother so she knows everything about my tatts and piercings and have known about them for years now. She never told me dad because we both know it's for the best and believe he won't take it too good.

I have recently moved in with my parents so I always try to hide it from my dad until just 3 hours ago he walked in on me taking a shower and voila he saw all my tattoos :( he didn't say anything and just said ""you don't close the door""(the door was very much closed lol) and never said anything after. I haven't spoken to him or my mum about it and I feel really bad.

So, uhh.. Idk what to do really. I feel so bad because my dad saw me as this good girl since i'm his only daughter and kept it from him for so long. what can i do?"
ewasker	2021-04-17 09:46:22+00:00	Tired and starting to get frustrated	"The mom takes our baby during the night, and both of them sleep quite well. At 06:30 she gives her to me and I have the baby for 2 hours while my gf sleeps. Then when the baby is tired again she goes to sleep with her mom for a couple of more hours. This is our routine and it works for us. But lately Ive started to grow a bit jealous of my wife sleep. She get lots of more hours in bed and I can never seem to get more than 6h. Should I just stfu and take this deal or should I try and talk with my wife to get her to take the baby some mornings as well? 

I also have a really stressfull job and it would be nice to get at least one night of full sleep in the week. And no I cant sleep when they sleep, i have a hard time getting back in bed after 2-3 hours of taking care of the baby in the morning."
Affectionate_Sea_808	2021-04-17 08:20:37+00:00	First time mom during a pandemic (long post)	"Hey all. This is my first time posting here, really just wanted to vent a little to other parents. 
I’m 21, a first time mom as well as stay at home mom, and my daughter will be 4 months old on the 29th. 
I’ve just been feeling very lost and lonely lately. I do absolutely nothing but take care of my child. I love being a mom more then anything, but I just wish I had someone to talk to and that this stupid pandemic would end so that I could get back to some normalcy.
I haven’t seen my friends or family in about 7 months.
Before I got pregnant I had a lot of friends and a very social life. I honestly spent almost every single day of my life with my 3 best friends. They basically lived with me. If I wasn’t with them I was with my sister and nieces, my mom or my boyfriend.. So I’ve always been very busy and out living my best life. Well when I found out I was pregnant I started planning my life for me and my child so I started distancing from my friends and social life a bit. My boyfriend moved into my apartment with me so of course I wasn’t having my friends over as much. I wanted to start getting use to not spending every second with my friends and doing what I want because I didn’t want to be a mom who was always out and about and not with her kid. I found out I was pregnant in May of last year so with the pandemic I also wanted to distance myself because I didn’t want to risk getting sick while pregnant. I was very forward about all of this with all of my friends and family and they understood that I was starting a family of my own and wouldn’t be the same wild and free friend I was before. I should also mention I’ve always had pretty bad anxiety so the whole pandemic actually scared the hell out of me. I was and still am terrified of getting sick. So during my second and third trimester I started seriously staying away from people but still keeping in touch. Well now my daughter is 4 months old and I have absolutely nobody besides her and my boyfriend because of COVID. None of my friends or family have met my daughter besides my mom. She has met her once after being quarantined for 14 days because that was the only way I allowed it.. My friends are in and out of bars and parties every weekend so I have not felt comfortable letting them see my daughter because I don’t want her to get sick. It’s my choice to be “lonely” and stay away from everyone, but it hurts my feelings because my friends have asked when they could meet her and I told them if they didn’t go to bars, parties and around a bunch of people for at least a week I would let them if they wore masks. I understand having to work or go to the grocery store but I didn’t feel like asking them to not go to unnecessary social settings before meeting my infant daughter was a unreasonable request. Well that was about 2 months ago and none of them have asked to meet her since.. I was actually told that they were saying to other people they want to meet my baby and see me but they can’t just “not live their life”... I don’t see how not going out for a week to safely meet your “best friends” child is stopping you from living your life? They were also telling people they miss the old me, which seriously hurt my feelings. I’m struggling enough with feeling like I’m nothing but a mom now considering I do nothing but be a mom so it hurts to hear people basically say they miss when I wasn’t one. Now they hardly even return my calls or text me back. Yeah I choose not to hang out  for the safety of my child’s health but I’d still love to have someone to text or FaceTime when I’m home alone with my baby or late at night when she won’t sleep.. they don’t even check up on me or my daughter to see how we’re doing. They did for about a month after I had her but now it’s rare when I hear from them at all and if I do I have to contact them first. I’ve been friends with them for years and we were extremely close. I have really always loved and cared for them so it just sucks to lose them. Maybe I am being to dramatic and scared about COVID and me or my daughter getting sick.. but it’s just not something I’m not willing to risk. My daughters health means more to me then hanging out with people.. I guess it is true that you see who your true friends are once you have a child :/
Sorry this has been a long post. I don’t even really know what I’m looking for out of posting this, just wanted to vent and see if any other parents are feeling lonely right now with the pandemic."
madnick1991	2021-04-17 08:04:49+00:00	Trouble Maintaining Feeding Times and Sleep	"Had our first child six days ago, a healthy baby boy. His only problem is losing weight. Our lactitionist wants us to increase our feeding periods to every two hours. She tells us to start feeding him every even numbered hour of the day. When I told her that he generally takes up to an hour before finishing, she reiterrated that he is to be fed again, one hour later. 

Our baby now eats not just twelve times a day, but for twelve full hours a day. It feels like I'm drowning my baby.

On top of that, during a two hour window, after feeding him for one hour, changing him twice, etc, my wife and I might have a 30 minute window for literally anything else in our life. We knew that caring for a newborn was going to be hard, and were/are prepared to give up most things in our life for the forseeable future. And since literally everyone LOVES to tell us that we wont get much sleep anymore, we already knew we were going to lose hours of sleep, but even we werent prepared to get cut down to 20 minutes of sleep every four hours. My wife has had a total of three hours over the last two days. Ive had two. All of it in ten to twenty minute blocks. And we feel like we are dying. 

What can we do? How can we possibly maintain this pace for the next three months?"

The first time I was away from him, I had to leave him in hospital after he was born and coming home by ourselves was horrible but is the first time I’ve ever been away from him overnight since then. 
I completely trust my MIL but I can’t help but worry he’s going to give her a hard time. 
Is this normal? Does this get easier? How the hell do I enjoy my time?"

"I have a 20-month-old who suddenly, every morning for the past month or two, I will go to get him out of bed for the day only to be faced with an insane amount of poop. I’m talking entire nappy loaded and also exploded out and leaking all through his pjs/bed. 

He seems to just save up 24 hours worth of poop for his bed and I am going insane having to wash his bedding and basically hose him down every morning. I have an 8 week old and this added mission every morning is really wearing me down.

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I have been to the dr and he has been cleared of any infection/bugs etc and appears normal and healthy. I suspected a possible sudden intolerance or something but the dr said it’s unlikely? I am going to get a second opinion but until then any thoughts/advice?"
mountainflutterby	2021-04-17 07:31:37+00:00	My ex has built my 5 year old a gaming pc and is teaching him how to play fortnight.	"I'm obviously horrified that he thinks this is a good thing to introduce to a small child who wouldn't even know what gaming is or violence otherwise. Having live chat with older kids and adults is also very scary with the language and potential vulnerability to abuse. I try to keeps things simple my end and I've been dreading him wanting a tablet to play games and zone out on all the time. I'm aware the world is different for this generation. But to actively build a gaming pc, when he's reading books about dinosaurs and watching Shaun the sheep.

I don't communicate with my ex, he was/is abusive towards me and I had to take him to court becuase was an alcoholic. We share our son every other week now. 

He's always bought him things inappropriate to his age, he's gone full out training him in several sports, buys him.very expensive equipment and essentially is creating a mini me..my son is exhausted when he comes home to me. He also tells me frequently that our son loves him more and will chose to live with him when he's 12 and has a right to decide. 

It's very complicated.
But now I'm just sat scared that my son is going to have nightmares or get addicted to gaming. His brain is still growing. His father is really really arrogant and I'm also worried my son will begin to feel superior to others in the same way.

I have lots of fears, he's only 5 and as you can tell. I've been through a lot as a mother already. 

 Any advice. Maybe I should contact my lawyer, we're back in court next month to discuss progress and the future for our son."
HoshikoNature	2021-04-17 06:39:34+00:00	Toddler has no sense of danger	"I have a 2.5 year old who has gotten into the habit of running for the road as soon as we leave the house. We also have a hedge row separating our driveway from the street, and she'll run around that instead of coming to the car to climb in. She also has no sense of stranger danger, she sees a person (like when we go hiking), no matter how far they are, she goes running up to them. No matter how much we call her back, or yell, or explain why she shouldn't be doing this, she just doesn't seem to understand nor want to listen and it's starting to stress me out because I also have a 3 month old to deal with at the same time.

So how can I get her to understand that it's dangerous to run onto the road, and that it's dangerous to run up to everyone? I'm worried she's going to get hit by a car or kidnapped one of these days, but she just doesn't seem to learn."
rocknroll888	2021-04-17 06:31:19+00:00	"Im planning on proposing, what would be the best way to talk to my son about this?"	"I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about three years now and overall, her and my son get along well. At first, he had some pretty big feelings about all this. His mom passed away when he was about 7 or 8 and me dating again had reopened some old wounds. He had felt as if I was trying to replace his mom. It took a while for him to accept and warm up to the idea. And to be fair, we did not get along a whole lot when he was a teenager, so I don’t think I handled that the best. 

      I’m looking for some advice on how to start this conversation and prepare for the possibility of these feelings coming up again. I don’t want to spring it on him that I’m getting remarried, so I want to make sure he’s involved in this."

She will go to school by herself, be a teenager and she will need me less every day. I'm looking forward to it at the same time. I can't wait to see what she will become but it hurts me at the same time. 

My husband never wanted kids but finally said fine we'll have 1. He loves our daughter so much, they are so close, but he still didn't want any more kids. 

I know I should be grateful for having one beatiful daughter, and I really am but I love being a mom so much. It just makes me sad that this was it. No more babies, no more running around after little ones no more chubby arms around my neck. 

Just needed to get it off my chest.

hey everyone, my newborn is 2 weeks old exactly, hes been extremely colicky from the start, he is exclusively formula fed, and we had him on enfamil in the beginning. regular enfamil. he would be up all night crying. pediatrician suggested to switch him to enfamil gentlease. the crying has improved DRASTICALLY. We have been giving him this formula for 24 hours at this point and he just pooped it was a grayish color with a little bit of yellow in it. it was definetly a smaller amount of poop than normal. before this all of his poops were yellow, i noticed the poop earlier today was more green and now its a gray.

I wont be able to contact pediatrician until tomorrow morning and most likely theyll return my call by the afternoon. I have two questions. 1., has anyone else had this experience before when switching from enfamil to enfamil gentlease? and 2., which formula should i use until i hear back from pediatrician? thank you if anyone can help"
woohaa09	2021-04-17 02:54:08+00:00	I really need some advice for school lockers.	"My son's school issued a No bag rule, they have to put their bags in the lockers unless it's medical. The problem is, only the rebuilt half of the school has long lockers, his is small like on TV. His bag fits tight in his locker without anything in it, the bottom shelf is too small. What can he do? 

This has been going on for a while, my son just went back to school and that's how we found out, I have mom friends who aren't really complaining about it so I'm not sure if it's just our problem or not and I don't want to take it to extreme if somebody here has experience and can help. He doesn't use a tablet or phone for school unless It's the specific teacher who allows it, so right now he has three textbooks and five notebooks and two library books and sometimes brings a lot, which cannot be kept in the nurse's office because it's reserved for people with dietary needs. We also don't know what to do with his utility box and IEP book, which he takes tl to classes with him but they usually don't let them have boxes that can spill or have weapons in them at lunch or assemblies. I'm considering trying to get them to switch them out lockers but I don't want to screw someone else over if we're overlooking something and there's a chance he would have a locker partner if he got a bigger lock er and that's an automatic no with his special needs."

All of a sudden, I see wiper fluid spraying across the windshield and I turn to my toddler and say “How did you do that?!” and he points to a button at the end of the wipers control stick that I never noticed.

Much-Cartographer264	2021-04-17 01:50:45+00:00	Back to work but my son is giving me a hard time	"like the title says I went back to work this week. I started doing administrative work for my dad's company. it's been good, working decent hours, 7am to about 4, 2 days a week to start which eventually will become full time once we all start adjusting. I have been home with my June 2019 baby since he was born. 
while I'm working he stays with my mom. these 2 days with my mom he's apparently been an angel. listens when she says no, holds her hands on walks, is calm, sits and reads with her, no tantrums and most importantly he has laid down and taken his naps there. since birth I've rocked him to sleep for naps and bedtime so I knew this was going to be the biggest hurdle. but according to her he's been wonderful. 

so when I'm done work I go back home with my dad to their house because my mom also prepares us all dinner. as soon as I get home to him he's scratching, pulling my hair, climbing like a maniac and basically being a menace. my mom says he's not like this at all with her. today after a long day of work I go to him and deal with the most temperamental my son has ever been. it was horrendous. 
hes also just been really aggressively affectionate to me. he pulls my ears so hard they're starting to bleed a bit because he scratches them, but he does this so he can give me a super hard kiss. he is slamming his head on me constantly. I've gotten a few bloody lips. I know he does this out of affection and wants to be close and cuddly. I do love it, but I'm getting beat up all the time.
and truthfully, my son is great. he's not a horrible kid, he's just super aggressive because he gets so excited. he was doing great with learning to be gentle but its gone out the window. 

I know my faults as a parent and as he gets older I'm having a much harder time disciplining him and getting him to listen. I'm inconsistent which again, I know isn't good. I give him his freedom a lot but when it's time to listen and follow the rules I'd love for him to obey. I was so embarrassed my mom could see me getting flustered. nothing I did worked. every time I tried to get him to calm down and listen he laughed like I was being funny. I've tried so many things ( albeit inconsistently) but nothing seems to reign this kid in. he's headstrong, stubborn and charming as all heck. he knows his way around us. 
while I am proud of him that he behaves when I'm not around, I also don't think I want to deal with work and then come home and deal with a devil child (no offense to my child, I adore him). I do feel like he's punishing me for leaving him. maybe this is just how he's adjusting to this big change. we are also moving in the next few weeks so I feel horrible he's going through many big changes so quickly but I also want to give him all the right tools to help him adjust positively.

We wash her hair once a week because she hates it so much. She has such long hair. She turns 2 this year and I hate washing her hair. It makes me feel so bad for her. Has anyone else experienced this? She doesn't like her head tilted back and hates water in her eyes, understandably."
Em_Pizza	2021-04-17 01:24:09+00:00	Enough milk in baby’s diet?	"I am starting to introduce purée food to my 6 months old. I am cooking rice porridge instead of buying the instant rice cereal. I would give him a bottle in the morning. For lunch, he would have some purée carrots and some rice porridge. Then another bottle around 4. For dinner, he would have purée carrots and rice porridge. Then another bottle before bed. 

I cook the rice porridge with water. I read that 6m baby’s main source of nutrition is breast milk. Is the baby getting enough milk in his diet?"
SonOfAnOptometrist	2021-04-17 01:24:09+00:00	Won’t nap. Won’t sleep. Won’t run out of energy. Send help please.	"Our 10 month old has never been the best at sleeping or taking naps but this past week has been a new low.  He’s a very, very energetic guy.  Doesn’t enjoy cuddling or holding still.  Likes to always be on the move.  I would think that would wear him out but no such luck.  We’ve been lucky to even get one 30 minute nap a day and it’s really rare to have two naps.  He’s gotten worse at falling asleep at night and sleeping any length of time throughout the night.  Somehow he still manages to have a ton of energy during the day and is usually in great mood when he’s up.  I’m worried this lack of sleep and quality nap time is going to have a negative impact but have no clue how to help him anymore.  It feels like everything we try doesn’t work."
maggiedubyah	2021-04-17 01:21:43+00:00	3 Year Old's Aggression	"Recently, (6 weeks ago) my DH and I welcomed our second baby, a boy. We also have a 3.5 year old daughter. 

I knew the transition for her would be difficult and prepared (read about it, asked advice etc.). She has calmed down emotionally and we are back in a routine now that the baby is a bit older so overall, she seems to be adjusting. 

However, she is REALLY aggressive with the baby. Hitting, throwing objects at him, scratching his face etc. Obviously, we are really vigilant and not allowing her to be alone with him as well as attempting to provide lots of consistency and positive attention but it is still occurring daily that she is hurting him and making him cry. This is really wearing on myself and my husband especially. 

Is this normal? Any advice or perspective is welcome."
csheabob	2021-04-17 01:18:38+00:00	My sister is failing high school	"Hello all. I (21F) am my sister's (17F) legal guardian as of June of 2020. I have an older post from a while back that goes into more detail about how and why this came to be, but basically she was doing a whole bunch of shit that she wasn't supposed to and my aunt and uncle wanted to get rid of her. She was going to be put in foster care but I stepped in and here we are.

So, she doesn't do lots of drugs or sneak out to be with bad boys like she used to. She isn't suicidal anymore (there were two attempts while she was living with aunt and uncle) and she has had a job that she likes since August 2020. The problem is she simply hates school. She was going in-person at first, and tolerated it but didn't really like it. I checked her grades often and they were good. Her teachers were chill and I never received any bad phone calls from them so I felt like she was genuinely doing good.

Well, I myself dropped out of college because it simply wasn't attainable or logical at this point in my life. I got a job with the USPS and the training is two weeks long.  I had to be at this training at 7:30 A.M. everyday, and this was right before Christmas break for my sister. I didn't find out until much later, but she skipped school every single day for those two weeks that I was at training. Not to go out and do crazy teen stuff, but just sleeping in bed. I only found out about this in February when the state law enforcement agency sent a letter saying that her license was suspended due to excessive absences. 

After the Christmas break, she wanted to switch to online and I was fine with that. But it has been a constant battle to get her to even get up 5 minutes before her first period zoom starts. She will hear me out and agree and we will write out a schedule and routine for her days, but it always reverts to doing the least amount of school work possible (if any) and taking naps between every zoom class. I have to work and I have no family to watch her or anything while I'm gone, so it is useless to try and monitor her 24/7. Besides, that isn't doing any good for her...she has to make the decision to try on her own.

I'm not even asking for good grades, I just want her to pass her classes. I even told her I will help on any assignments and as many as she needs in what free time I have, but anytime I ask about school she reverts to lying. I get calls from teachers asking me to tell her to submit her 2-weeks-overdue tests and quizzes. And she knows that if her attendance isn't up at the end of the semester that they will not reinstate her driver's license, but it does not seem to be a good motivator.

Her only two friends are two years older than her and they go to our local university. I knew them before she did because we went to the same high school, and I know they're good kids. I only let her hang out with them on weekends or after she's ""done"" with school, but I know she always lies about being ""done"". 

I just checked her grades for the first time since our last heart-to-heart about finishing high school and not lying to me. She isn't a bad person and she was hurt that she hurt me by lying all the time, yet she continues to do it. She has a 100 in P.E. and her three core classes are all below 50. She wants to go to cosmetology school and I know her so I know that would be a better option than college, but I don't even know if she will graduate HS at this point.

In less than a month, we have a court date with the judge who granted custody to me. I have full custody, it is not a temporary order, he just wanted to do ""check-ins"" since this is a rare situation, and this is supposed to be our last one. She had good grades at the last one and everything went fine. I'm worried now that my custody of her is at risk due to her attendance and failing grades. I'm so constantly stressed and worried but I literally cannot force her to do her work no matter what punishments I give or wisdoms I try to impart. I know I definitely cannot go on with this for another year (or more since she's likely to fail this quarter). We have no other family, though, and I would never abandon her. I just have no idea what to do."
ironic-hat	2021-04-17 01:11:45+00:00	Benadryl for children under the age of 4	"So here is something that threw me for a loop.  My two year old has a mild cold.  The pediatrician mentioned in the past to not give cold medicine to children under age two.  Since he is over age two, and meets the weight requirements, I offered him 5ml of Children’s Benadryl at bedtime to aid his sinus congestion.  Dosage was from a pediatric medical group that listed the amount per age and weight.  

Nearly immediately after I gave him the medicine I start seeing a million articles saying you shouldn’t give children under 4! cold medicine.  Great....

So I am confused about the effectiveness and safety of this product.  Does it actually work and this is just a warning to prevent parents who may use it as a sleep aid vs it’s true purpose.  It seemed to reduce his runny nose, so I can’t imagine it not working as some articles are claiming."
Mommabear2311	2021-04-17 01:10:14+00:00	Am I wrong? My husband always makes feel like I am in the wrong.	"You are going to need some backstory so please bare with me because I really need advice. I'm really not in a good mental state.

My husband and I lived apart for quite sometime(years) because of custody issues with my son. I am finally moving to the state he is in.  We have 2 children together.  My oldest is not his. We have one chance for him to get our household belongings.  I have givien up primary custody of my son which was a really hard decision for me so we could be a family. (I will get summers, the GAL said it's best if my son stays) Our youngest has a l severe mental disability so I cannot raise him alone.  I feel like I am choosing one child over another.  I feel like no choice I could have made was a right choice.

Well to get to the point.  My oldest son's father did not even look at the papers we sent over when we told them that this would have to be done by x date.  Well my husband is telling me he is now not coming to get our stuff or visiting us for the week he took off of I do not leave.  I feel like if I leave without papers I will get screwed, like I don't care.  Things in court never gone my way and I feel like just up and leaving will hurt me on the long run.  He is manipulative and putting a lot of added mental strain on me.

What am I supposed to do?  Am I wrong for wanting to stay until papers are signed?  What is the big deal with him getting out stuff and setting up the house without me especially when he blames me for him not having a relationship with our youngest two. Papers still are a issue because my son's father is saying if I see my son once a month I cannot visit him a second time in the month.  I'm a emotional wreck."
xxeminex	2021-04-17 01:05:52+00:00	What makes it worth it?	"I (24F) wanted to come here and ask, what made you want kids? What are the pros of having kids? What advice would you give someone on the fence about having kids? Is it really worth it? 

My fiance (25M) loves kids and wants our own (someday--years from now). I also love kids, but I'm scared to ever have them, both physically and emotionally it seems so taxing. I'm afraid of falling into depression due to the energy it takes to care for a baby. I also can't picture myself giving birth or nursing my child. I think I'd want to bottle feed, but I'm scared of the judgement I'd get. 

I'm also afraid of how it can change a marriage. My fiance and I have an incredible, loving relationship and I've seen how couples change with the stress of kids. I never want to lose the relationship I have with my fiance. 

I've always had a caregiver personality, though, and I love my nephew and spending time with him (he's 7 months old)

 and  a childfree life also seems really permanent and possibly depressing to me. I feel like kids bring purpose and life into a family, but does that outweigh all the exhaustion and frustration?

How do you know the right decision for you? What if you regret your decision? 

(also, just wanted to point out my fiance is very supportive that I'm on the fence about kids. he's also wants to do a lot of discussing and researching before we make that decision someday)"

He doesn’t listen and continuously does what he’s not supposed to. We are young parents and by the end of the day there is so much stress and anxiety that I especially can get short tempered. I hate having to yell at him and it’s not even really working anymore. I just see his face crying and the sound he makes breaks my heart. I just feel like he doesn’t understand but I’ve tried to be as clear as possible with him in a way he can understand but he does it anyway. He grabs things off the desk, won’t stay in bed and messes with his older brothers bedding at night and waking him up. Messing with curtains. I love him and I’m tired of yelling,l. Any advice?"
Top-Requirement-2102	2021-04-17 00:29:58+00:00	One of the joys of parenting is when your children teach you	"Of course, children can teach us even from the moment of being born, but I'm talking about my experience today, spending a few hours talking with my 28 year old son and realizing that he is thinking about the same deep questions that I am and he had some things to offer as a peer.   

This is the thing I have learned from 28 years of parenting six children:  children are peers to their parents.   We happen to be in charge for a while because we were born first, but our job is basically to show the new people the ropes, not to tell them what's what.   Our kids will eventually wander bravely into places we couldn't dream of."

I have 5yo twins and I'm so exhausted. We have family around but my mom never takes them. She very occasionally watches them for us to have dinner out but it's so stressful that it's not even worth it. I'm too tired to do anything. 
In 5 years they've only slept at my mom's one time and she kept calling and messaging me for everything. I've had no real break and I feel like like never stops. 
Anyone else feeling this way? I'm so jealous (not in a mean way) of my friends who have parents that actually take their kids for days or a weekend so they can relax a little."
redvanpyre	2021-04-17 00:00:03+00:00	Pain years after cesarean?	"I'm almost 2 years PP. About 8 months ago or so, I started having pains juust to the left of my scar. Nothing intense, I usually notice it when I'm laying down or sitting for a bit. 

My PCP thinks it's infections (due to other coinciding things like discharge or frequent urination when I see him) but my OBGYN said I sound like I have nerve damage from my surgery.

I also had an ultrasound in January to rule out ovarian cysts. I of course, riddled with anxiety since having my baby, think everything is cancer. 🙄

I've wondered if I maybe am pulling at it by doing kegel type exercises, because I catch myself doing them without noticing all the time.

RunRevolutionary9019	2021-04-16 22:24:28+00:00	I’m really struggling with how to proceed with my mentally ill child.	"My kid was perfect until about eleven. The easiest kid on the planet. Did well in school. Was reasonable as a two year old even. Super chill and still is actually. 
Then they started doing worse and worse in school and said they were hearing voices. And I could feel it. I was terrified. 
I had nights I was worried I’d wake up to a dead kid. There’s not objective reason why but that was how I felt. 
Finally last year he said he thought he needed medication for psychosis so we went that route and it is been night and day helpful. 
I no longer worry about my kids happiness. 
Now it’s just school that’s the issue. 
He also has ADHD. He’s a genius. He’s an amazing amazing artist. And he’s transgender if that matters at all. 
He really struggles with school. It’s not just that he has a hard time he just doesn’t want to deal. 
We’ve tried a few ADHD medications with varying success. 
He has two tutors but blew both of them off this week. I’m happy to say he is excited about his drum lessons and does lots of art so at least he’s not sitting around doing nothing. 
We are pushing him into art like my moms parents did for her but even that isn’t always easy. 
He’s unmotivated. 
A part of the problem is I have chronic health issues so my energy is limited. I also have ADHD so I feel like a kitten trying to herd kittens. 
More and more I’m feeling like I’m failing my kid and I don’t know how to proceed. 
I’ve said he can’t see friends if he doesn’t do his work and I’m so torn on that path. I’m not sure isolating him is the way. 
If anyone has gone through this and and can share their experience I would so appreciate it. One of my half sisters also has psychosis but it is untreated. She lives with her mom and doesn’t work. 

My concern is I’m sick and not sure that will be an option. What if I’m gone? What if I can barely support myself? 
I’m doing everything I can to get my home paid off so we have a place to live if things get really real. 

He thankfully has a lot of friends. He does want to move to the city. I’m just not sure how he’s going to support himself. 

Praying he gets a clue like I did and gets it together. I dropped out of high school. Which again makes me a horrible example and pretty incapable of helping him with school myself. 

I now make good money and have a masters degree. It was and is just really hard given my imperfect brain.  

I gave up on work today. I just couldn’t. My body and brain were not having it. So I completely relate with my kid. We have major sleep issues. 

When I had him I was very healthy and had mostly nipped my ADHD in the bud but for whatever reason getting sick kicked it into high gear. 

But I don’t want him following my path but I’m also not sure there’s a thing I can do about it. 

We both have great therapists and lots of support to be clear."
tealambert	2021-04-16 22:23:29+00:00	How to get through to teenage daughter?	"My husband and I are at out wits end trying to get through to our 13 year old daughter. The last few months she’s been pushing the boundaries and breaking rules and our punishments don’t seem to be getting through. 

Her first, and biggest offense, was using her iPod to message strangers on the internet when she knew the rule was family and friends only. We took her ipod for 2 weeks. We gave her the benefit of the doubt that she misunderstood the rules when we said friends because she said the person she messaged was her “friend”. We clarified it was friends we knew in person and gave it back after the 2 weeks. 

Had to take the iPod back a few days later for the same reason. This time we grounded her for a month; took all electronics, no outside for a week, and made her write a two page apology explaining why what she did was wrong. We also explained she would have to complete 200 chores to pay us back for iPod. 

About 2 weeks into punishment I caught her trying to turn her tv one night. I told her that her month long punishment would restart and she now had to keep her door open unless changing. 

Tonight she was outside playing and I called her and her sister in for dinner except she was nowhere to be found. We called several time and eventually found her a few houses down from the boundary house she’s not supposed to pass. 

She is a very thoughtful and kind young lady. Each time she breaks the rules she express she understands the rules and why they’re important. We’ve never had problems with her before. Everyone usually comments on her great manners and sweet disposition. She never complains, never talks back, she’s the easiest kid a parent could ask for. 

No matter the punishment she just doesn’t seem to care, she just rolls with it. She literally couldn’t care any less. This time we took all toys, her bed, her clothes, snacks. She has a sleeping bag, a few books, and a military green shirt/shorts from my husband. We told her the law says she needs food, a roof, and clothes. The food doesn’t have to taste good and the clothes don’t have to look good. 

Does anyone have any advice because I’ve run out of things to try. She’s a good kid and I want to keep it that way but she needs to listen to the rules, not break them. Any ideas?"
FranniPants	2021-04-16 22:02:31+00:00	(Almost) 2 yo: Is this a coincidence or by design?	"I have an almost two year old son. Wednesday night he was playing with his six pack of crayons while my sister/her S.O. were over and he handed us each a crayon: black to me, yellow to husband, red to older son, green to sister's S.O., blue to sister, and kept orange to himself. Cute, he's sharing!

As the night went on, several times he handed the crayons back out to us. Each of us were given the same colors each time and he got very upset if we tried switching with one another. 

Yesterday - he handed out the crayons again. Once again: yellow to husband, black to me, red to older son, and kept orange to himself. (Blue and green remained unused) I thought it was weird but okay?

Tonight, same thing. Same colors. He gets upset when we try switching. 

Is this coincidence? Is he associating certain colors with each of us, and that's why he wants us to keep what he's giving us? Or... is this a sign of autism or something similar?"

When I ask her to bag them up it’s this huge ask and I get “I’m not gonna do it because you’ll just Sk me to do a bunch more stuff.” 

Seriously? “Yes! You live here and have to do stuff. If you don’t like it, please consider living with dad!” Then she accuses me of pushing her out and going to live with dad is a threat. But it’s totally not! I think it’s a good option and he would love that.

My daughter turned 3 in March and is incredibly advanced in all areas, except she was holding onto her dummies. I think I partly enabled this as I was worried about dealing with the fall out.

Well today! We bit the bullet, she has been asking for a specific barbie doll for a while and we made a deal to throw her last dummy into the bin outside the toy shop and that she could get the doll. 

She was very excited at the time but reality has set in and since we got home and she got more tired, she has become more and more unsettled and crying for the dummy.

For the moment she is settled but I wondered if anyone had any words of encouragement I could say to her to try and help her through this transition period. I keep reminding her how proud we are of her, etc. But I'm wondering If anyone thats been through this before has any tips for what worked for them.

remk19	2021-04-16 19:32:33+00:00	Would you have a child's bedroom on a different level from everyone else's?	"Two of our children share a room, and the 9yo has expressed they'd like their own room. We do have an empty room (guest room) in the house, but it is on the ground floor while our other children's bedrooms and our bedroom are located two floors above the guest room. 

To me it feels like it could be a safety issue, and my anxious mum brain thinks of all the different scenarios that could happen having their bedroom be so far from the rest of us. My husband has some concerns, but when it comes down to it, he thinks if 9yo wants to have their own bedroom, we should make it happen especially because we can.

It’s not that I think she’s ugly by any means, she’s adorable and very sweet and snuggly. But I see pictures of her and don’t melt like I did with her brother, who looks more like his dad.

babydekuscrub	2021-04-16 18:55:19+00:00	Are there any bike trailers for kids that can convert to a rear/parent facing stroller?	"We really need both a bike trailer for two, and a parent facing double pram, and it would be fantastic if we could find a single item that served both purposes. 

I'm not having any luck searching online but maybe there's something hidden out there somewhere. I did find the Joggster Velo, but it looks like it needs the double carry cot attachment to be parent facing, which looks more suited to twins rather than a baby+toddler combo. 

Any ideas? Or if anyone has recommendations for either double bike trailers or double prams that have a rear/parent facing option those would also be welcome!"
hermionesarrasri	2021-04-16 18:49:26+00:00	Almost broke my wrist on my daughter's animal sounds book	"I (32f) wish I was kidding. My 3 year old loves marking her territory in my room by leaving her favorite clothes, books and toys there. Today, I got up to get dressed into my running/workout clothes and as I walked around my bed I slipped but put my hand out to catch myself on my bed. I didn't fall but the result was immediate pain I would say was a 10 and up there with giving birth on my arm all the way to my shoulder. My eyes filled with tears as I carefully righted myself and I called my husband and was sobbing when he finally got to me. Hint: I have only ever cried during childbirth. My pain tolerance is pretty high. I've gotten headbutted, slapped, and punched in the face by my kids (toddler tantrums)This pain was bad. I spent an hour at immediate care to get x-rays. Fortunately it's just sprained. I'm now in a cast for the next week. 

That's not even the worst part. As I went down, the stupid book went ""Mooooo""

I know what's going light up the fire pit next 🤬.

I'm kidding about burning my kid's favorite book. But the temptation is there. 

I'm now going to literally single handedly rage clean my room. 

Why did this have to happen to my dominant hand? 😭"

 A classmate of hers, who she is friendly with but not close to, is moving away. She wrote him the sweetest letter, and in it told him that she is giving him a stuffy after school so he has someone to cuddle with while travelling. She has it in her backpack so she can give it to him as soon as the day is over. This is such a big gesture for her, and I can't get over how freaking proud I am of her for being so giving and thoughtful. She's obviously getting nothing in return, she just wants to make sure he has something to cuddle with during his flight."
dixieeisele17	2021-04-16 18:27:42+00:00	Need advice. Feel like my husband is being wildly inappropriate.	"I literally just found out that when my husband kisses our daughter (on the mouth which already feels wrong to me but I’ve tried to be okay with it because I know it’s the norm for some people), he apparently also touches her tongue with his. I find this to be wildly inappropriate. He says that I’m making it something that it’s not but innocent or not, I basically told him that he is the parent and she is the child. Just because she wants to do it, does not mean he needs to abide and he’s making me out to be overreacting. I do believe that he doesn’t mean this in a harmful way, but I told him I think we need to discuss this with our therapist along with our daughter’s doctor. This seems wrong on so many levels to me and feels like it is seriously crossing a boundary between father and daughter and for him to think it’s not even a little bit wrong just to blows my mind. Please offer all advice."
DancingPopcorn237	2021-04-16 18:06:00+00:00	How to approach discussing baby with infertile family members?	"
I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but here goes. 

I (30f) and my husband (27m) have a 2 month old baby boy. I have two sisters in law. One is a few years older than me and the other a few years younger. Younger SIL and her husband have two young children (4m and 2m). Older SIL and her husband are infertile.

When we first found out I was pregnant, older SIL and BIL were the first ones we told. We met with them privately to tell them before telling anyone else so we could be certain they would not hear the news second hand. They seemed genuinely happy for us. I was relieved by this reaction as SIL had seemed upset by other pregnancy announcements/ baby-related news within the family. I discussed my pregnancy with my older SIL if she asked me things, but tried not to talk about it overly much otherwise as I knew babies/children were a sensitive topic. (For example, SIL attended my baby shower but was quiet and seemed on the verge of tears for a lot of the afternoon. It was the same at my younger nephews last birthday party. I tried to talk with her privately after the fact to make sure she was alright and she insisted she was fine and didn't want to talk about it.)

I am in an ongoing group chat with my MIL and two SILs. We just chat about what we have going on in our lives mostly. I currently stay at home with the baby, so the bulk of what is going on with me on a daily basis is baby-related. Would it be insensitive to include these things in the group chat (baby rolled over for the first time, etc)? I know my MIL and younger SIL love hearing about the baby, but it seems hit and miss with older SIL as to whether or not these things are upsetting. I don't know of I should have a separate group chat to discuss baby milestones and such or if that would be inappropriate as it would exclude older SIL from baby related conversation. Does anyone have any experience with something similar?"
kristigem	2021-04-16 17:53:35+00:00	I’m taking my son to buy a dress.	"I have two sons. A six year old and a four and a half year old. My older boy is into Minecraft, Mario and sonic the hedgehog, play fighting, and playing in the mud. My younger enjoys princesses, baby dolls, and stuffed animals. His favorite colors are pink and purple. He has also been growing his hair out for the last two years. He likes having hair styles like mommy. 

Both of my boys have gotten a mixture of stereotypical “boys” and “girls” toys as they’ve grown up. Dinosaurs and dolls, horses and action figures, a play kitchen and hockey net and sticks. 

We’ve always let them lead in telling us what they want to play with. They get to choose the clothes they wear. If there are different colors of an object we’re buying for them they choose their colors. They decide how they want their hair to look like. We’ve always told them that it’s their body and they had a right to choose. 

When we moved to our new house two years ago we unpacked a small rainbow dress that I had crocheted when I discovered I was pregnant. He was two years old. It was a bit too small for him, but he loved his “princess dress”. Obviously after a year he could no longer wear it.

Two days ago, he asked me to get him a new dress since his rainbow dress is too small. I told him I would think about it. I talked to my husband to get a game plan about this. 

This morning, we asked him why he wanted a dress. He said because they're pretty colors and they have flowers or stripes on them. 

Then we told him he can wear whatever he feels comfortable in, but that dresses are usually worn by girls and he said ""just because dresses are for girls doesn't mean that I can't wear one"". 

We said that people might make fun of him if he wears a dress. We asked what he would say to someone who told him that dresses are for girls. He said, ""I'll say that this dress is for me!"" 

I’m taking him to the store today. This kids confidence is through the roof and I'm so happy he feels comfortable enough to be who he wants to be. Im a little worried of what others will say to him, but I want him to be happy and comfortable in what he looks like. This is definitely uncharted territory for me who grew up in a very conservative and restrictive household. If anyone has any kind tips or comments please feel free to share."
babygrlnad	2021-04-16 17:30:12+00:00	How to have conversations with my kids about diversity and injustice (now and ongoing)	"Today my toddler and I were listening to a Tracy Chapman song and he commented that she's brown. I realized that due to quarantine his exposure to other people, especially people that look different than him, has been so limited. I did my best to explain that everyone comes in different colors and shapes and sizes. I explained that just like his cousin has red hair and mom has green eyes and grandpa has brown skin, other people have all different kinds of features. He seemed satisfied with that answer, but it got me thinking.... 

I am half white and half middle Eastern, but looking at me people assume I'm just white. My dad has dark skin, hair, and eyes, and an accent. My mom is blond with blue eyes and freckles. I grew up in a very diverse community that was predominantly Haitian, Dominican, and Jewish. Conversations that my parents had with me as a child were reiterated in meeting and knowing all kinds of people. We now live in the same state I grew up in, but in a much less diverse town, and I want to make sure we start having very open conversations very early. And I am not sure how to make sure those conversations click if most of the people around my boys have the same skin color and life experiences. 

And I know I am coming from a position of privilege- we are a white family in a middle class neighborhood, and both my husband and I have graduate degrees. But I am raising two white boys that I want to be empathetic and understanding and allies. I want them to see the injustices in the world and try to make it a better place. I want them to stand up for people who are being discriminated against. 

I know I just need to be open and honest, to talk about things we see in the news, and to have age appropriate conversations that hopefully come up organically. But any other advice?? Things to make sure I say, or make sure I don't say?? I don't want my ignorance to play a factor at all, and I'm sure there are things I'm not even aware that I am unaware of."
Complex_River	2021-04-16 17:29:14+00:00	whats the problem is with my kid painting her face? Can someone please explain this to me.	"My kid loves painting her face. Like she looks up pics of face paint and tries to recreate what she sees or gets super in to making her own designs. 

I think its neat to see her so interested in something creative. I let her wear it whenever she wants- which is almost always in old-school time and to school for special days (holidays/party days-its preschool). 

I legit do not see anything wrong with this. Yet, now that it's gone on a while, I've found that people make vague judgemental comments about it. Not to her, they're always super nice to her...but I hear stuff like:

""You let her go anywhere like that, dont you?""

""She doesnt care what she looks like, does she?""

""Oh, her face is painted...again""

But it's got like a certain judgy tone, if that makes sense. 

One of her friends moms always offers to wash her face so she will ""feel clean"" - she has soap and doesnt paint her mouth area for practical eating/napkin purposes, the same mom who asked if I thought it was age appropriate  (shes 5). 

Can someone please explain to me what's going on here? I'm concerned I'm missing something about why letting her do this all the time is a bad idea? What would be off putting about a kid with frequent face paint?"

Derangedbuffalo	2021-04-16 16:56:41+00:00	Does anyone else feel guilty for being unable to play when you’re ill or injured?	"I have been experiencing a lot of pain with sciatica this past week which has gotten so bad that I struggle to walk and can’t stand for long at all. Because of this I have admittedly spent a lot of time alternating between laying and sitting down. The exercises my doctor gave me have actually caused more pain, so I’ve been advised to just take it easy for a few days to reduce inflammation. I’m currently on a strong anti inflammatory but so far it hasn’t helped. 

Because of this I just can’t really play, I can’t sit on the floor, I can’t play football in the garden, I can’t even pick my son up and give him a cuddle. 

I just feel incredibly guilty and awful. The house is messy (I have slight ocd so this is also very stressful and shameful for me) and I just feel awful as it’s half term and my son must be so bored. 

I feel like this rant (kind of) is just getting it off my chest in the hopes that others have been in this situation and that I’m not an absolutely awful parent because of this"
Grimmshadow88	2021-04-16 16:47:26+00:00	How to get over or better handle the anxiety of new parenting?	"I’m speaking with a therapist for my PPD/PPA, but I would love to hear from real parents. 

How did you get over the anxiety of being a new parent? Things are constantly changing, sometimes for better sometimes for worse. I have such a hard time doing anything now. I’m terrified to leave the house because what if he doesn’t nap in the car? I’m afraid to take any trips because what will I do when he melts down and I can’t console him? Will he ever sleep anywhere besides his crib? The terror of changing anything that is working currently paralyzes me on a daily basis. I’m too afraid of the change to come to do anything. I feel trapped and I want to learn to let go and just go with the flow, but I just…cant for some reason. 

How did you let go and learn to be some level of zen with the ups and downs and change? I’ll listen to anything at this point because this much anxiety and fear is starting to make me feel like I’m not cut out for this even though deep down I know I am."
leakygatsby	2021-04-16 16:45:39+00:00	Diaper Rash Thread	"First time parent checking in here and looking for some advice...

My son is 11 weeks old and is overall a healthy and happy baby. On formula for the last 8 weeks (won’t say more other than breastfeeding vibes weren’t clicking). He had shown a tendency to spit up more than what we and our pediatrician were comfortable with on low-volume feeding sessions so we moved him from Enspire to Gentlease to AR (all Enfamil products).

There was a low level of blood in his poo when after being on AR for a week or so although the spit-up got to an acceptable point so our pediatrician recommended we try Nutramigen since it is Hypoallergenic. We switched to that last week. Spit ups continue on Nutramigen, but honestly he doesn’t make a big production out of the spit-ups and it doesn’t seem to cause him discomfort.

Anyways, how does this translate to poo... what comes in must come out, right? As parents who are also on this fun ride of trying new formulas likely understand, his poop consistency changes drastically amongst all the aforementioned products. When he hit AR, his poop was getting thicker and creating less frequent BMs. Again, this didn’t bother him and actually was nicer for us to clean since it lessened the chances of blow-ours. He was never getting diaper rashes up through AR, not even the slightest redness (FYI, we have always used Pampers Swaddles and Sensitive Wipes). 

Fast forward to jumping to Nutramigen... this is causing his BMs to be much more frequent (back up to 5 or 6 per day rather than the 2/3 on AR) and almost liquid consistency. The liquid consistency seems to also be causing a diaper rash causing the skin to be raw to the point of skin breaking and slight bleeding :( obviously this is causing discomfort with him. We started using Boudreaux’s Butt Paste with each changing but not having much success.

Anyone else have these types of problems/can make any recommendations? We have already contacted our pediatrician to try and get him moved back over to AR if she clears it but any advice from others would be super appreciated."

steel867	2021-04-16 15:59:35+00:00	Any tips	Hey never posted in this reddit or on hardly any reddits tbh. Im 23 and got with a girl and she has a 1 and half year old we got a apartment together and everything has been going relatively smoothly. The only problem we are having with the baby is when one of us is alone with him. He is a very naturally chill baby. He will watch whatever is on tv. He will occupy himself with his own toys. I mean he's a golden child. The second we are both together with him though it's like a flip switches and he whines constantly. If she leaves the room he starts bawling non stop. He will literally hang on her leg and whine and won't let her take her attention away. And if she even lays her head on my lap while we are watching tv he will walk up and start hanging on her or grab things he's not supposed to and whine pretty much just to get her undivided attention which is stuff he never does when it's just one of us with him at once and just try to test us. I'm assuming just to get attention. The only thing I can figure out is it's a jealousy thing. But we've lived on our own for almost a month and a half now and it is not gotten any better at all and I'm just wondering if anybody has any tips out there on what to do. Because honestly I never thought I would have a child at my age but I was willing to take on the challenge because  his father is not in his life so I knew he wasn't going to grow up with anybody as a father figure. But this jealousy thing if that's what it is it's just the main barrier I'm trying to get over right now so any tips would be nice.
atsignmakayla	2021-04-16 15:58:26+00:00	My Sister tries to make me seem like a bad parent to her friends	"Important information: my sister is 19, she’s got issues caused by childhood trauma with our mom (although often times this is used as an excuse for her fairly shitty behavior), she lives with my grandma, I’ve got a 6 month old daughter, and a 2 year old son 

Backstory: my sister and I haven’t really ever been EXTREMELY close, but whenever I got pregnant she started begging me to move in with her and my grandma and the closer it got time to deliver my son, my husband and I decided that maybe it wasn’t such a bad idea so I’d have the extra help since he’d be working (we ended up moving into our own apt by the time my son was 6 months old), so prior to his birth i had specifically asked no one to post pictures of him until we were home, settled, and I had shared his picture because he was my first and so this time was very special for my husband and I. I didn’t want to be bombarded with comments just yet, i wanted to savor those moments. Well the day he was born i sent our immediate family a picture of him, well right after i had sent them my sister posted them on all her social media accounts (as minor as that is, it is only the tip of the iceberg). When we got to come home there’d be several instances that my son would wake up crying and she’d come across the hall into our room and tell me that she would get him and that i could go back to sleep (there was only a few times that I took her offer because newborns are exhausting; but most times i still got up because i enjoyed those times with him, I wanted that bonding time). She’d take hundreds of pictures of him, post him on her Snapchat story, take pictures of him and her but never of him and I (still a minor and petty complaint so i left it alone). Well when my son was about 6 months old we got our own apartment (less than 5 mins from my grandmas) my sister then had an emotional breakdown saying she felt like “her nephew was being taken away from her”, we literally were moving a few blocks away. She seriously tried asking me if she could keep him every weekend like we’re co-parents or something. I told her that no aunt i know keeps their nephew every weekend, and that i wasn’t going to have set dates to when she could keep him. I was very lenient with her at first, she’d pick him up with her friend who had a son his age and I’d let her take him with them to the park up the road from apt, he’d stay the night every now and then, ya know. Typical things. But then my cousin comes to me telling me she recorded a video of my apartment (while we were moving furniture) and sent it to him and my other sister saying my apartment was a mess, and that she acted like she always had my son. Shortly after this another one of friends also comes to me telling me she makes it seem like she always has my son and that my husband and I are bad parents, and then i also got screenshots of her telling people my son was hers. All within a very short period of time. 

Anyways fast forward to now and she’s not kept my son in MONTHS, she’d been asking lately, and acting more mature so i figured I’d let him go over for a couple hours (plus i hate that my grandma also has to be punished when it’s not her fault). So since COVID i told her i didn’t want him around anyone other than her and my grandma. Of course she didn’t listen, she had a friend who’s got a daughter younger than him come over to have a “play date”, later that night i get a call from my grandma saying my sister and her friend left the kids in her room by themselves and that my son bit the little girl on the foot causing her to fall off the bed (he sees me nibble/tickles his baby sisters feet so I’m almost 100% sure this is all he was trying to do, not bite her). We go get him and she starts telling me her friend with the son has been talking about me so i message her friend only to find out this (screenshots posted below). I really just need advice. I don’t know what to do at this point.. obviously my son won’t be going back there for a very long time, if ever."
flippytuck	2021-04-16 15:33:08+00:00	Extreme Favoritism	"Make a long story short, we have a 2 year old boy who has been keeping us very busy. Just to give you an idea of the type of child he is, he whines a lot, can't sit still, throw's lots of temper tantrums and this is usually on a daily basis. With that being said, he does a lot of this with his mother and not me but he does test me still quite a bit. My wife says it's like being in an abusive relationship, our son treats her very badly but obviously she loves and does anything for him. It's starting to break my heart, she is an awesome mother and person and I can tell she's becoming depressed about it. I can wake him up in the morning no problems (most of the time), if she wakes him up, he goes full mental and the same thing with bed. He prefers me over her every hour of the day and it's starting to become a struggle. We have told our pediatrician about it and she just shrugs it off as being a normal process but the thing is, this has been going on for 6+months and I'm not sure how much more she can take. Just looking for any type of guidance at this point."

TIME. if he is allowed to go potty. He will wake us up in the middle of the night, ask during a movie, while he is eating ""I need to go poop"" ""can I go pee?"" and I have no idea where he learned it from. He will not go to the bathroom without asking first. He has not once walked into the bathroom when he feels the need to go, and just go. It drives me and my husband crazy!! I figured maybe he is learning that the bathroom is a safe place, could it be psychological? We have always encouraged going when he needs to and accidents have never been a ""bad"" thing. I have a niece who kept pooping her pants (despite being almost 5y.o) because she regressed from disciplinary action. Has anyone else dealt with this??"
bonniebindi	2021-04-16 15:20:44+00:00	The daily morning struggle	"I'm at a loss. My almost 12 year old (who is likely ADHD) can not get moving in the morning to save his life. I've been trying to work on proper sleep hygiene with him, and that's a nightly struggle too. He tells me how exhausted he is in the morning, which worries me and I told him we need to see the doctor about it, and then he backpedals and says it's not something to worry about, it's ""just a sometimes thing"" (Which it's not - he's just avoiding). In fact, he will give me every excuse and argument under the sun to avoid doing what he needs to do in the mornings especially.

He's not necessarily avoiding school though - he's got an active social life, he gets decent grades and is a generally happy kid. But given the choice to sleep in, miss school, avoid responsibility and play video games all day, he 100% would. 

I have tried to talk to him kindly. I've given him melatonin at night. I make sure he's not on screens when he's supposed to be in bed. I've worked incredibly hard to not lose my temper, and there's been steady improvement on my part. I've given him lots of options in how to get up in the morning, I've done EVERYTHING I can think of to do. He still gives me massive pissy attitude about it and can barely drag himself to do anything in the morning which frustrates both of us. 

Short of quitting my job and home schooling (which would be a disaster for other reasons too) - what do I do with this? Is this just going to be a daily misery for both of us for the foreseeable future? I've got a lot going on myself right now and I'm not going to drag him into it, but his attitude is not helping and I'm trying desperately not to let it trigger me either."

This just started happening this week..  shes outgrown her boppy pillow so we usually feed her on the floor (lol) so first thing in the morning at 7 when she wakes up shes usually hungry and eats 8oz no problem in an hour.. well this last week we are lucky if shes eats 4oz in an hour.. she has no intrest she just wants to play so we try to let her play 5 mins then eat more.. sometimes it helps sometimes no.. at noon shes gets spoon fed in her high chair a whole jar of baby food and another bottle but again the same thing she will eat then  be fussy and cry so we give her a break and try again in the chair.. after awhile tho we let her out to pkay or nap.. shes only formula fed and we didn't switch bottles but maybe need to up the nipple flow size to the next since shes on dr brown size 2 and according to the website should be on a size 3.. so I have them coming but what else can I do until then. I know she will eat when shes hungry but I donr want her to be ""starving"" shes pooping and peeing fine no issues there.. she has no teeth coming in that I know of so I thought that could be an issue... any tips I hate to call my doctor for something that might not be something where he just tells me this might be normal ya know what I mean?"
BulkyMoney2	2021-04-16 14:49:43+00:00	Traveling During Pandemic?	"Hey there

How many of you have traveled during the pandemic? With a toddler in tow? 😅

I am taking my son on a 4.5 hour road trip for his 1st birthday, but I am more so asking about international travel involving a plane. I am turning 30 this summer &amp; I’d like to take my son on a trip with me. He’d be 1 year old. 

Might be important to add that my son has had COVID already. In fact, his father had it too, but I never became positive. I am planning to get vaccinated at some point (I used to teach, and will eventually need to return to the classroom). The doctors who treated my son claimed that he would have immunity for some time, but again, I understand that this virus is something we’re all still learning about. 

I guess what I’m asking is, if you traveled during the pandemic with a little one, what were some of your fears and how did you resolve them? Also, any tips if you have them. 

Thanks!"
TangoDeltaFoxtrot	2021-04-16 14:42:44+00:00	6yo and 3yo sneaking/taking food ALL the time!	"Title pretty much says the main gist of the problem.  Wife and I have three kids- a 6 year old, 3.5 year old, and a 1.5 year old.  The youngest isn't getting into our food stuff, it's the two older ones. 
 The younger ones have Celiac and have pretty bad reactions to gluten.  We do a good job, we think, of finding foods that all the kids like to eat- we figure if it's a reasonably healthy recipe and the kids beg us to cook it and they eat it all, it's probably a keeper and one that we rotate into the menu frequently.  I say that to point out that we try to make foods that the kids actually enjoy eating.  

We also make a variety of treats such as popcorn, ice cream, brownies, fruit cobblers, cupcakes, etc... maybe every couple weeks or so we make some sort of treat kind of food and usually it's gone in a day or two.  We keep snacks of all kinds in the house- plenty of apples, oranges, bananas, grapes, cheese sticks, yogurt cups and pouches, crackers and cereals for all the kids, veggies like carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a variety of dressings they like to dip them in, bread (gluten free and regular) for sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly, tuna, sandwich meats, corn tortillas so we can make snack quesadillas really fast, we have like a hundred eggs on hand at any given time so we can make scrambled eggs or boiled eggs or whatever it is the kids want to eat.  WE FEED THEM A LOT.

We'll feed them a big breakfast, like with potatoes and eggs and oatmeal and milk and juice and fruit, we let them eat until they are full.  If they really didn't eat enough, we'll ask them to finish at least their eggs or something so they get some protein.

We do still have a number of foods in the home containing gluten, and we do make some meals, maybe for guests or an item for just me or my wife, using gluten (I love to bake).  Our kids are generally pretty good about knowing what they can and can't eat, but they're kids, they don't know all the food stuff.  We have a large drawer in the fridge full of nothing buy stuff for the kids- cheese sticks, fruit, yogurt, and space on a pantry shelf for non-refrigerated items.  THEY STILL TAKE STUFF IN EXCESS AND HIDE AND LIE ABOUT IT.

A few problems with this- they will sometimes get into food that has gluten and end up with bad reactions- it's not bad enough to go to the hospital or life threatening for them, but they will end up with very upset stomachs and can break out in bad rashes.  Also, they will eat so much random crap that they then won't be hungry for their actual meal and will hardly eat at all for dinner, then they'll pillage the pantry overnight and make a giant mess.  

When we ask them why they are taking food, their answer is always the same- ""we were hungry.""  Like, DUDE, you never even asked me for food, not to mention all the food that's already available for you to eat, so I don't buy the ""we were hungry"" answer.  Besides, they're not eating foods that you would eat if you're hungry, they're eating junk food or snack food or sugar.

Here are examples of foods they have eaten (each item was taken or consumed in one night):
-12 bananas
-large plastic container of brown sugar
-24 cheese sticks
-three boxes of cake mix (yes they ate it and made a giant mess)
-three cans of whipped cream (they take whipped cream any time it's in the house, literally the same night we buy it)
-a whole pack of sliced cheese
-8 apples
-10 cadbury creme eggs
-entire pan of brownies
-whole box of instant oatmeal pouches
-12 yogurt cups + 12 yogurt pouches
-half a strawberry rhubarb pie
-an entire cinnamon dessert pizza
-2 lbs of grapes
-1 lb bag of chocolate chips
-1 lb bag of powdered sugar
-4 sticks of butter
-giant canister of hot chocolate mix
-entire case of juice boxes
-all of the baby's gluten free snacks for road trips
-a giant bag of parmesan cheese
-half a 9x13 pan of baked oatmeal (we make this for breakfast sometimes and snacks)

I just don't understand- they have food free for them to take, and they won't touch it most of the time.  They prefer to binge on the junk food at night or while I'm at work and my wife is in her home office for 3-4 hours a day.  They hide all the trash in their room and always lie about it or blame each other.  We have tried locking the fridge and cabinets, but the kids have figured out how to open every kind of lock we can buy at the stores near us.  I mean, I could install actual keyed locks on everything, but that seems ridiculous.

How can we get this to stop?!  There's nothing rational about any of it.  Like, why would they think eating a bag of sugar is what they should eat if they're hungry?  Why don't they just ask for what they want?  We only say 'no' if it's near a meal time or if they refused to eat their meal we will tell them to finish their meal before they get anything extra.  If they ask for something like a bowl of sugary cereal, which we do let them have sometimes, we might offer them something else like an apple or a sandwich.  We frequently will prepare snacks for them throughout the day and even cook extra meals just for them if they have been out playing and say they are starving.  BUT, they will then come downstairs and take 20 cheese sticks while we sleep.  WTF, HELP?!"
talosguideu	2021-04-16 14:40:01+00:00	My 2 year old jumps on me constantly at night and I don't know how to stop it	"No matter how early she wakes up or how often she skips naps, my 2 y/o stays up until about midnight. We have lights off and TV off about 10, and she stays wild. She jumps all over me, kicking me and hitting me (on accident) because of the rough housing. 

When I push her away, she starts laughing and turns it into a game. I try to turn over and ignore her but it doesn't work. I've tried moving away, holding her while she squirms and telling her no, and leaving the room for a few minutes and coming back. 

I could really use some advice or ideas, it's really exhausting and hurts and it takes a lot out of me to remain gentle and patient with her. TIA"
ozarkhome	2021-04-16 14:22:40+00:00	4 year old asking strangers for hugs.	"I'm not sure how to go about curbing this behavior. My 4 year old grandson* has never in his life had a fear of strangers. Lately he's been approaching people anywhere we are, asking their names, telling them his name, asking what they are doing, and asking for a hug. Once he went up to a man and touched the gun the guy had on his waist and asked what is was. We almost went through the roof! (On the inside, we tried to be calm on the outside)

I'm trying to suggest that he asks for high fives instead of hugs but I'd like to get him to slow down on the constant... Introductions? 

He hollered at a jogger the other day asking for a hug. It's just constant.

I've set up an evaluation with a pediatric behavioral psychologist through his pediatrician for some other concerning behavior that's been going on forever. I'll be bringing this up to them as well but wondered if anyone here has experienced similar. His 3 year old sister does not do this although she isn't particularly wary of strangers either.

*Just for clarification, my son and I parent his 2 children together. I have power of attorney for both children.  I am very involved in their upbringing and they spend half their time with Dad and half with me. Mom abandoned them 3 years ago. I am not mom, but I fulfill the mom role."
kimtheresppldying	2021-04-16 14:17:30+00:00	Dealing with lice/neighbors kids	"My 3 year old and I both have head lice and I’m concerned that she got it from the neighbors kid. I’m a stay at home mom and the kids next door are really the only people we come in contact with on a regular basis. The little girl was putting her hair clips on my daughter the other day (in hind sight, I probably should have nipped that in the bud but hind sights 20/20.) 

So the real question here is how do I approach the parents without sounding accusatory, just like a “just to let you know my daughter has lice” ? and how long should I keep my daughter away from them? How do I know if they’ve even treated their kids? 

I have pretty bad social anxiety and I don’t want to be rude but I also don’t want to be battling lice forever. I remember my half sisters ALWAYS had lice growing up."
AnonymousMIABlank	2021-04-16 14:12:44+00:00	Need Ideas for “Job Training” for 10 year old...	"My 10 year old does not care about his grades. He does not seem to care about anything except electronics. He consistently refuses to study, won’t allow me to check his work, and rushes through his tests/quizzes so he can have more time to play on his Chromebook. We have removed all electronic privileges, but he has to have his Chromebook because everything at school involves using the school-issued Chromebook This means my normal discipline methods have not been as effective. I have decided that I am going to begin “Job Training” with him to prepare him for the work he will be doing as an adult if he does not care about learning, achievement or his grades. I need ideas for my training program. I have decided to teach him about landscaping and pressure washing this weekend. What other ideas can my fellow Redditors come up with for my new job training program?"
Clopidee	2021-04-16 14:07:07+00:00	"My nephew quacks, is this normal?"	"My 14 month old nephew saw ducks for the first time about a month ago and learnt what quacking was. Now he'll be playing with a toy or just walking around and go ""wack-wack"" randomly. It's adorable but also as he does it even if there is no reference of ducks for him to see. 

He used to roar/growl whenever he saw a dinosaur or dinosaur-looking creature like a dragon, or if he even heard the word dinosaur, but the quacking is completely random. I thing maybe he just likes the sound? Before roaring he used to kinda sing to himself randomly.

Does anyone else know babies that do this sort of thing?"

So my daughter (16)just got her learning permit, she's quite good at it, I'll let her borrow my car, which is a sport car, and can reach up to too much horse power, so I just thought ""let's install the cruise control""

But the Main problem is:She used to help me at my car repair shop, and knows how to deactivate or just take it out,I would of course check if it's still operational and there, but it wouldn't take much to just put it on and off.

I'm afraid she'd do it, I wish I could trust her like that, but I've been young, and she got ""those"" kinds of friends that like to always take it to the next step. 

should I just buy an used car for her?"

I_Ch0se_A_Username	2021-04-16 13:27:59+00:00	Should I take my son on vacation even though he is failing his classes?	"My 14 year old son has been having behavioral issues for the last few years. He has been ignoring his school work and is fairly every class but football. Currently he has 3 classes with averages under 20%.

During remote learning his mother and me (divorced for about 10 years) have tried everything. At first we let him try on his own until we learned he was failing most classes (average of 60%) in most classes.

We tried having him print out his daily assignments and show us each assignment as he turned them in. After a few months we learned that was doing the assignments but not submitting them. Next we tried sitting behind him to make sure he was submitting his assignments but he was still failing. We then learned that he was doing the work then submitting blank files.

We took him to therapy and he told them that he was refusing to do the work because him mom and me were micromanaging him. The therapist suggested giving him more room and seeing if his grades improved. His grades almost immediately dropped an additional 15-20% in every class.

In addition to his grades he has been behaving terribly. Yelling at us, cussing at his younger brother, and refusing to do anything besides talk to his girlfriend. He no longer goes outside or does any of his hobbies unless we force him. When he has his way he just sits in his room texting his gf. We have tried taking away his phone (nearly 6 months this most recent time) and his behavior only got worse. He keeps saying “I’ll behave if you give me my phone back”. But we are refusing to let him make demands like that.

I used to live in Hawaii and typically take a trip back at least once a year to visit friends. I’m preparing to book this trip and his mom and me are stuck on if I should take him or not. His mom and I feel like it would be good for him to get out of the house and spend time with me, but also are worried about treating him to a big trip while he is purposely failing his classes.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated"

I inspected him, and I didn’t see anything wrong with his head or his attention. After 10 mins, he fell asleep. 

Should I take him to the doctor? Or should it be fine if I see nothing wrong with him?

Outrageous-Skill-456	2021-04-16 12:20:55+00:00	Sometimes I wish my 7yo son was more like my 3yo daughter.	"I know they're individuals with their own personalities but my 3yo is so much more easy going and makes my life easier. She's caring, listens when I ask her to do something, and is very polite.

My son is the complete opposite. He is argumentative about everything and very emotional. Anytime I ask him to do something I'm given a firm no. I always I have to tell him to say thank you and use his other manners. I'm not sure if it's just his age because he's been like that since he was a toddler. Honestly, he makes my life harder and there's no peace with him. I love him to death but he is very exhausting. 

Please no judgement. I just have to vent a bit."

pandamonkey23	2021-04-16 11:41:16+00:00	Why don’t people show parents more grace on their learning curve?	"I had a crappy day today with meltdowns galore from my toddler. Some of this occurred in public and I received glares from many (mostly in the retired age bracket). I always feel empathy towards parents who are having a rough day, but I have noticed that whenever a parent struggles on a reality TV show (e.g super nanny) all the comments suggest that everyone else is a perfect parent and they don’t need to reflect/change at all. The comments are always “my child would never have dared to a/b/c” and the parent is described as “weak”. Why is that people are allowed to struggle in so many areas (sports/school/body image etc), but if you struggle in parenting it’s like you are a lesser person? Where is the grace and compassion? To me parenting is the thing I am most invested in and I’m trying my very best to get it right. But I am learning!! A sympathetic smile would have gone a long way today."
duk31nlondon	2021-04-16 11:38:26+00:00	14Y old son rejects everything but video games and watching TV	"We're 2 weeks in the Easter break and our son has done virtually nothing apart from playing GTA online and watch TV. After a weeks on holiday we realized he was breaking the 4h screen time limit we set him by also playing at night. In parallel, he'd done none of the exams preparation he'd said he would do as condition of him getting this screen time allowance.

I am worried about his attitude to everything else.  

On homework, at best he pretends doing something by writing a few lines of vocabulary or sentences from revisions books but on discussing with him, it's clear he doesn't know what his notes are about. Any question about how much he plans to do gets him angry. 

When asked about the reading list issued by his school, his answer was that he bought a book. it turned out to be a book recommended for children around 10 years old. 

Outdoors sports (he plays Hockey) has restarted but he the news training was restarting got a shrug from him. None of everything he got to try with our without us (sailing/tennis/football/rugby/MTB) gets his vote and everything seems too much of an effort.

So it feels like he'll do anything (sleep deprivation, lying) for some screen time but has at best contempt about everything else.

Is this something that requires outside help ? Can other parents can relate to and have seen improving over time ? What seemed to help ?"

I asked her if I spoke to her nan would she confirm the story, her eyes grew wider and she said no. Then she went on to tell me she ‘found’ it laying around and her grandparents place and put it in her wallet for safekeeping. We’ve talked about how it was wrong of her to take it.

RiceCakeMuffin	2021-04-16 09:41:57+00:00	A story I'm sure all parents can relate to.	"Here is a true story  I sent my family on the 27th of December last year that I have only just felt at peace with to share!


Today as we travelled back home, car stuffed to the nines belly's full and tired from Evies 0400 shenanigans, we thought nothing could go wrong.

Evie was ready for a nap and we left and made good time. Till Cooma. When the wailing started. And kept going.

Everytime I turned around Evie smiled and was happy. So here I am playing with Evies feet blowing raspberries and eventually I get sick of the games and shove her dummy back in.

The wailing continued around the dummy till she spat it out. It landed in her lap and Dad reached his hand into her lap and there it was, the dummy, and the litteral shitstorm Evie was sitting in. We had only 20 mins before discussed how the size 2 shorts we got her were too tight.

By the time we could pull over there was baby poop everywhere over evie. She had spread it up her nose, in her hair, in her mouth and all over her car seat. Dad had a handful and there was a dummy coated.

Its 32 degrees so the flies instantly swarm us. The nappy gets kicked out and slides down my leg. All three of us have have now been tarred with the same brush. The carseat requires forensic cleaning and size 2 shorts were abandoned. We ran out of wet wipes in easy reach and accepted that some things will never be the same. And now we have returned to our travels with new fly friends a smell that lingers and a still crying baby."

I've been making do with wearing exercise shorts at home (HA! video calls only show face!)  but my shorts are hurting me now. sigh- looks like it's time to get clothes- and I HATE getting more clothes!

2. What's the minimum i can get by with the baby? seriously? I have on my list carseat, probably a stroller, but a blank on what else. I'm thinking more 2nd hand, usable (easy for me to get on the kid, and wash, rather than cute)."

We recently enrolled her to an online pre-k class on [DailiesPods](https://dailiespods.com/) to see how things would go and surprisingly, she’s talkative! She loves answering questions and chatting with her classmates as well and seemed to really enjoy her class. We also noticed that she became more open with her feelings and emotions. Loving to see our daughter’s personality bloom at such a young age :)"
sandrajn	2021-04-16 04:22:40+00:00	Parents of left-handed kids - anything different you had to do to support your child?	"We’re parents to two children- a two year old girl who is decidedly left-handed and an 8-month old that is showing preference for his left hand. 


Someone once mentioned scissors for left-handed people and that set me thinking- as right-handed parents, I’m not sure if there is anything we can do to make things easier for them or this is required at all? 


I’m interested to hear experiences parents of left-handed children - growing up did they face any difficulties and what helped make it easier?"
TARS1986	2021-04-16 04:09:47+00:00	Tired of feeling guilty	"Title says it all, and if you’re reading this as a parent you know what parental guilt feels like. 

I’m just stuck in this endless cycle of guilt with my kids (3 year old and 3 month old). The guilt is 99% from my relationship with my 3 year old. 3 month old and I are cool for the most part.

The 3 year old has just cut me to my core. She has the most intense personality traits of both my wife and I (my inability to focus, and my anxiety - and my wife’s strong willed nature and temper). She’s absolutely a fun and loving kid - she makes me laugh a ton, has some really sweet moments of unprovoked demonstrations of love and compassion, and can carry a tune like she’s much older. I love her very much. 

However, because of her personality and my personality, not a single day goes by without some sort of serious drama where I lose my cool and then feel guilty for failing. Theres’s some guilt. Or, if I can’t play with her or give her attention she looks so dejected. I could be working, exercising, or just truly trying to catch a breather and zone out for 2 minutes on my phone. The fact that I can’t spend all available time with her (and honestly I don’t want to), I feel guilty too. Like I’m letting her down. Or when I’m rushing her and just seem to only care about what I need to get done, I’m not considering her pace or feelings. It’s adapt to my needs or I’ll get upset. Again, more guilt. 

I’m just sick of this. I’m sick of feeling so guilty all the time and feeling like every day is a failure in parenting. I’m not sure if other parents here feel the same, but I’m hoping I’m not alone."

There is a FINE LINE between spanking and abuse. As a little kid, I got spanked and all my friends did too. Spanking tells a kid “You do something bad, and you get a little physical punishment”. It is an effective method to discourage your kid from acting out. It worked on me. Don’t believe all those articles."

I try feeding, burping, rocking him, car rides, gas drops( not every night) and nothing works. At first I thought maybe he’s lactose intolerant like I was when I was a baby and need special formula but if it was that wouldn’t he be doing this during the day? But he doesn’t.

Redqueenhypo	2021-04-16 03:47:19+00:00	"Don’t get kids knockoffs, they can absoltjely tell"	"Look, it does suck when your kid asks for a moderately expensive thing you can’t buy them, but getting them a knock-off version of it is just not a good idea, especially if you plan on trying to pass it off as the original. Your kid can tell you got them Emu boots instead of Uggs, or that their new coat very clearly says Canada *Duck* on the side. They’ll notice and worse, so will their classmates and they might make comments.  It’s much better for their psyche and your relationship to them to just say outright “that’s too expensive, but we can look for something similar if you want”."
RGMFilms2020	2021-04-16 03:46:08+00:00	Parents holding their kids to a standard they were not held too	"Is it fair if my parents hold me to a standard that they were not held too. I ask this as since they were not held to a certain standard they don’t know the stress. For example my grandparents didn’t hold my parents to a standard for their grades. So they just did what they wanted and had decent grades. But they put this constant pressure on me for my grades which has caused me mounds of stress. I’ve had a 3.9 or higher gpa my entire time in school because of all the pressure from my parents, but it’s starting to catch up with me and have been dealing with what I presume is depression (I feel unmotivated at all times and even when I want to do something my mind just doesn’t let me do it and I have these existential thoughts that everything I do is pointless because we all die). So I was just wondering if parents holding their kid to standards they were not held to is fair as they don’t know how much stress it causes."
VaginalChristmas	2021-04-16 03:35:17+00:00	Sleep nightmares	"Our son is 3.5yo and just returned to preschool after a year of being at home with us. During that year a lot happened: he stopped napping, has a new baby sister, got potty trained, and we moved to a new house. The issue we are having now that he’s returned to school is with sleep because he started napping at school again.

He has always been a good sleeper and has historically gotten to sleep pretty easily, especially since kicking his nap. Bedtime was 7:30 and he’d wake up between 6-7am. A total dream. Now that he’s back in school 3 days a week and napping on those days, those three days are horrific at bed time and throughout the nights, too (usually). We pushed his bedtime to 8pm but it’s still taking him ages to fall asleep. Last night it took him until 10pm. It’s been very hard because we also have a newborn and the overall lack of sleep...let’s just say we are tired and don’t need more sleep issues. 

The director of the school says he is very against any of the kids not napping from a safety standpoint— they play hard and need a break. He says our son is falling asleep when it’s time to power down and I believe him. We don’t want to do our son a disservice— if he’s exhausted at nap time then shouldn’t he take a nap? Yes, of course. And they assure us the naps he takes are 30-40 minutes. But they are clearly fucking with his sleep at night and it’s making him over tired and cranky because he can’t get to sleep and stay asleep. 

We don’t know what to do. Any advice?"

To say she is not a good mother would be an understatement, we have weekend visits with the kids, and every week it’s something else. The kids cry and tell us things like  “mom hits us” or “mom always yells” or “mom said your a stupid fat idiot dad” or “mom smokes in the car and it smells so bad it burns my nose” the list goes on and on. I have a whole photo album on my phone of bruises on the kids, clear hand print bruises, they’d come in the middle of winter with no socks, no underwear, in just a sweater. she’s on Ontario works, gets baby bonus for 4 children plus child support from 3 different men, has never worked (she’s only 27) she was in London housing but was evicted with her 4 kids in November 2020 And since has been living with a friend, in a 2 bedroom apartment. Mom and all 4 kids have been sharing a room/bed since November but yet she just financed herself a brand new 2021 suv and is taking  4 kids on a plane to Calgary in 1 week... but can’t afford to move out of a bedroom with her 4 kids. My partner and I both work decent jobs with great benefits, have a 3 bedroom townhouse where the kids have their own rooms, the kids tell us daily (when he have them) how much they want to live with us and hate being at moms, it’s heart breaking when they have to leave, they bawl the whole way back home. We are
Currently going through family court but due to covid almost everything has been halted, we’ve reached out to CAS with our safety concerns for the child and so far nothings been done, and unfortunately we can’t afford a lawyer/don’t qualify for legal aid so I’m just at a loss, I love these babies like my own and I hurt seeing them hurt, but I’m very careful not to over step as I’m just “dads girlfriend” I let mom and dad handle the business.

Ok on to the Drama part.. .. like I mentioned, she is taking her 4 kids to Calgary (from London, ON) to visit family for 3 weeks, which my partner disagrees with for a few reasons, in Ontario we’re currently in a “Stay at home” order but she’s flying from Ontario to Calgary just to *visit family*, he will be missing 2 court mandated visits with his kids, and Calgary’s covid numbers in youth are scary high. I told my partner that  due to my work, the children can’t be at our house for 2 weeks after their back, I work in a covid vaccine clinic and have to report if I or anyone around me has travelled, and I have to stay home if so. Not only that, but she’s putting her children in unnecessary risk that I’m not willing to have exposed to my 2 year old. I love all our babies but I need to keep my home, family and employment safe. Me requesting a 2 week quarantine once they return has started a HUGE battle with the ex AND my mother in law, they both think I’m trying to keep my partner away from his kids, being selfish and putting my son before his children but that’s not the case and I’m not changing my mind. My mother in law has blocked and deleted me from EVERYTHING and the ex is refusing to give us our weekend with the kids before they leave because “if you don’t want to see them until 2 weeks after they return, you don’t need to see them now” apparently she has always been awful but I’ve only been with my partner for 18 months now and I’m still adjusting... but am I wrong for requesting A two week quarantine and sticking to it?"

Ebgirl1448	2021-04-16 02:48:46+00:00	A great job offer AND ~5 weeks pregnant. How do I negotiate parental leave?	"I am currently employed at an okay job with poor work/life balance and very ready for a change. Excitingly enough, I just received a job offer for a position that I’ve been interviewing for over the past 4 weeks- AND I also JUST found out that I’m ~5 weeks pregnant with my first child (x5 positive at-home pregnancy tests can’t ALL be wrong- can they? 😅). My husband and I are very excited for both events, but for obvious reasons the timing isn’t great for them to both happen at the same time. 

The benefits packaged PDF I received doesn’t talk about parental leave specifics or eligibility. I’m also so early in my pregnancy that my OBGYN won’t even see me until 8 weeks, and I’m not disclosing to anyone in my circle until it’s actually confirmed by my OB. 

I from digging around online and Glassdoor, I’ve been able to scrounge up that this new company offers good parental leave, but may likely require employment for 12 months for eligibility. So I guess my questions are as follows-

1.) Is parental leave eligibility negotiable? 

2.) How do I have this discussion with HR without saying I’m pregnant since I’m so early in the first trimester? 

3.) Should I disclose that I am pregnant before accepting the job officially? I hate the idea of going into a new job not being completely honest, but am afraid of early repercussions of it too. 

4.) Any other advice or similar experiences to share? I want to handle this the best way so I can be successful at my new job and start it on the right foot the best I can. 

Thank you all in advanced!"

I’ve caught them 2 time laying in bed together despite the rule of no boys on the bed. She follows the door open rule. They both admitted to me that he has touched her private area, she took his pencil and stuck it between her legs. So I don’t think it was intentional.

My 10 year old daughter has recently developed an interest in a boy in her class. She’s got her own iPod that we use to communicate with her, and we allow her to talk to “friends”. She’s with her dad this week and her iPod is home with me. She called to ask me to look up a friends email so she could talk to them while she’s with her dad. Well I got nosey when I saw “my boy ♥️ “ with “I love you too “ texts. I scrolled through the messages and it was a lot of “I love you, let’s hug, I can’t wait to hug you, let’s sneak a hug” but also “will you sit on me (to hug)”, talking about “are we dating”. I’m fine with her “liking” someone, but want to teach her boundaries and age appropriateness , if that’s even a thing. Can anyone offer advice on this ?  I don’t want to shame her by any means.

delavenue	2021-04-16 02:00:56+00:00	I'm ready to learn how to apologize.	"I grew up in a home that was void of apologies. My parents were too proud to admit their mistakes to their children or each other. They left me with a poor framework for resolving conflicts.

As a wife and a mother, it's something I'm working hard to relearn. I feel confident in my communication skills with my spouse. But when it comes to my daughter, Im struggling. I've never seen a parent apologize to their child and my recent attempts felt inadequate. My daughter is young (nearing 2) and I feel this is the time to practice and get into good habits, but I don't know what habits to be forming.

How do you apologize to your child? Are there different types of apologies (for minor transgressions vs major mistakes)?

Do you mind sharing an example of an apology that went well?"

maryberrysphylactery	2021-04-16 01:50:10+00:00	Health visitor shaming our sleep pattern	"We currently have a 2.5 week old baby and we are receiving the home visits from the health visitor (UK). The baby is healthy and thriving but like most newborns he struggles to sleep unless held. 

As a result my wife and I sleep in 2-3 hour shifts, with the other staying awake holding him. This has worked well and ensures that both of us get about 6 hours sleep in total a day. 

The health visitor keeps ranting to us though how we need to get out of this habit because it isn't sustainable for us, especially when. I go back to work. She keeps telling us we need quality sleep, 4 hours at a time and together as a couple, but this seems totally out of touch with wha having a newborn is like. He isn't a dog I can't just train him in a few days to sleep 4 hour stints on his own. 

We tried sleeping her way again and it's left us both with about an hours sleep, and too tired to take shifts from each others so how is that more sustainable when I'm working again?

Partly I'm renting but I'm interested if anyone has some input on newborn sleeping. We have a bedside crib and Moses basket and currently use a arms up swaddle sleep sack thingy or arms out sleep sacks. He can sleep 2 hour stints sometimes in the moses basket occasionally but it's not super reliable yet. 

Mostly I'm just s bit tired of having s healthy thriving 2.5 week old baby, and both parents being tested and functional and STILL being made to feel like we are doing it wrong by the professionals."
SweetNo8122	2021-04-16 01:44:04+00:00	Can you get PPD when kids are 3 and 5?	"Throw away. 

I love my kids and was obsessed with them when they were babies. I think I was skin to skin contact for two months, breastfed, everything. Then... I got depressed. I think it’s because I stopped taking care of myself and going out because i was all about my kids. 

Now they are 3 and 5 and holy shit, I can’t do it, the whining, complaining, fighting, throwing trash, spilling everything, etc. 

I can’t have anything nice, can’t ever have a clean house, no alone time. I try not to yell much but when I do it’s when I hit the top and I raise my voice loud. I never cuss or hit. But really inside I just wanna scream. I’m a horrible mom now. Don’t even know if this is me or if I’m depressed anymore. 

I’m in my bathtub crying right now. Googling “I don’t want to be a mom anymore” but the thought of ever losing them makes me sick to my stomach, I’d probably die of heartbreak if I ever lost them. So why am I like this? 

When my kid yells that he hates me it really hurts my feelings. I feel I give everything I have, I give the kids everything and I get nothing in return. Not even a clean house. I buy something nice, they break it. I replace the carpet they spill on it. 
 
Then I sit here feeling horrible because I’m gonna look back at this time and wish I could see them this little again but in the moment I’m struggling. I feel like I’m ruining them. 

I think about my previous life. I was happy, I had friends, I had money. I could have paid all debt off by now but ha!!! Not even close when I have to pay $1600 a month for daycare. 

I’m a bad mom. 

Now I’m just venting and saying things I wish I could say out loud. I feel like shit for feeling like this which brings me down even more on top of what I’m already feeling. 

I don’t even know who I am anymore. And the sad thing about it is they are preschool all day so I barley see them and still feel like this. 

My husband had them one day and they were great, the moment I get home they act completely different. Start whinnying, fighting, constant touching me. DH says “they weren’t like this 5 minutes ago” must be nice."
gluuey	2021-04-16 01:43:06+00:00	How do I make my almost 5 yo child like school?	"A little bit of background: our son has been staying at home with me (Dad) since birth while my wife works. He’s always been a little cooped up and overprotected but well, he is our first born, so I guess most parents are guilty of this. Or what do I know...maybe not.

Anyhow, we tried preschool about a year ago but the wasn’t ready psychologically or emotionally, so we pulled him out. It was too hard for him and he would sincerely cry, not sleep at night and be sad to a point where at the time, we thought the best decision was to let him mature more before trying school again. Next year he will be going to Kindergarten, and we decided to send him to a small preschool in a small class for 6 weeks before the summer for him to get his feet wet. His teacher is great and caring, we try to be as supportive and positive as possible.

Today was his second day in school, and he has been doing okay although he seems stressed and physically and emotionally more tired than usual. He also isn’t eating anything there (picky), which is not helping. He has started telling me he doesn’t want to go back the next day and bombarding me with questions all day long about why he needs to go to school, why he can’t stay at home, why I (his father) can’t stay at school with him...

He’s a smart kid, and he’s asking himself too many questions. He is extremely stubborn too. It seems like he’s just waiting for the day to pass by and me to pick him up when he’s there. I’ve tried telling him he should try to have fun and time will go by more quickly. I’m just running out of ideas of what to tell him so he will understand school is important and have a positive attitude. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Let me preface this by saying I have no problem with the lgbt+ community. I’m a silent member of the community myself. 

So about 6-9 months ago, my stepdaughter got a secret phone from her bio mother. Her mother told her not to tell her father and I that she had a phone. She spends her time on tiktok and discord and since discovering furries and the lgbt community she is absolutely convinced she’s lesbian and a boy. We supported her choice to come out as a lesbian. Then she changed &amp; said she was a boy. She changes her mind weekly about her pronouns (he/her) and I’m at my wits end. 

Last night she had her phone taken at the end of the evening, (this is the routine at home) and she lost her temper with her father, saying she should be treated like an adult. He said “I speak with you like you’re an adult because I value your opinion and your feelings, but you’re a 12 year old girl. You will be treated like a 12 year old girl.” 
She waited for her father and I to go to bed before leaving a note at our door saying “if she can’t be a boy then she’s leaving “

We spent the night searching for her, involving the police and filing a missing person report. 

When they located her a few hours later, they called us and told her she was safe and we were not to go near her. She had told them (the police) she was scared of us. 

I’m currently waiting for the police to return her home. I’m so anxious and angry about this whole escalation and I honestly don’t know how to react or even remotely what the appropriate way to handle this is. Please help."

LobsterDumps	2021-04-16 00:40:26+00:00	How do you make sure your child recognize when they are with an unsafe person?	"This is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. I never had anything awful happen to me but when I was 14 I was hanging out at a friends house and my parents were unable to pick me up. Her older brother offered to take me home and I told my friend she didn't have to come because she was tired. He started acting inappropriately and tried to touch me. He stopped but told me I was immature and never talked to me again. I never told my parents and spent a lot of time thinking I was the wrong one in that encounter. It took until college to realize that he was in the wrong and acting inappropriately. 

I watched a show yesterday that brought up a similar topic. A high school aged girl was manipulated by someone she trusted and blamed herself. I have a 5 year old son and we talk about appropriate and inappropriate behavior. We don't talk about strangers because I know the majority of people are abused by people they know. How do you make sure your kids are able to realize when a situation is unsafe? How do you make sure they know it isn't their fault?"

Their mother had a stroke. Father has late stage Parkinson’s. Our childcare has been spotty for a few weeks due to Covid issues, and we just lost another provider we were counting on. My mom has been staying for over a month to help out, but she volunteers half her day and is just kinda too tired for a baby and a toddler. 
My partner took their brother to dinner to get him out of the house (he’s primary caregiver for the parents, all day long). 
I stayed home with the baby, the toddler, my mom, brother, the childcare provider who just quit. I tried to eat dinner with both kids climbing on me. Nobody offered to try to take one. They finished and cleared the table while I put the baby to bed. My toddler is watching iPad (allowed after dinner), my mom and brother went to go watch a movie. I wanted to see it but they didn’t want to wait for me. Fine, okay. I wanted to eat some more food.
My partner texts me from the restaurant. 
“Did you turn on a movie?” 
I said no, mom did. 
They said “what is (the toddler) doing?” 
I said watching some videos while I eat. 
“Well, okay, as long as it’s not a movie.” 
Parents, I feel disrespected and I feel spied on. I am home with two babies and (functionally) no help. I don’t know what kind of alert my partner got on their phone that someone in the house was watching a movie. Did they get a notification I rented “Dunkirk” and immediately thought I put it on for a three year old? What if I *did* bend one of our rules and put a movie on because I am in survival mode? Does my partner get to decide how I make it through an evening they aren’t here? 
I really want to find out what electronic device is sending these notifications and just tear it out."

My husband would really like us to pierce her ears before she’s a year old because they are “cute” and also because he’s worried that if she wants earrings when she gets older, she will be too afraid to get them.

I think he’s hanging onto this too much because she’s his little princess. I think we should just wait to see if she even wants earrings when she gets older, maybe 4 or 5 years old at the earliest. Since I have the only woman perspective in this marriage, he’s ultimately going to defer to me on it but I still am open for discussion. 

I finally pierced my own ears when I was 17. Sterilized a safety pin with fire, cleaned my ear lobe, stabbed it in there, and then kept it clean. Ended up never really wearing earrings. They get stuck in my long hair too much and I don’t do “updos” except for a messy bun or tight ponytail. But mostly my hair is down all the time. 

Come to find out, my husband sort of wishes I wore earrings 🙄 I think they are annoying. I wear my wedding ring and the occasional bracelet/necklace for date night and that’s it. 

I digress. What do you think? Pierce them now like my husband wants or wait like I want?"

jingles360	2021-04-16 00:04:02+00:00	Dealing with recurring pain at bedtime in a toddler	"Our 3 year old complains every night of “knee pain”, which we have come to realize as general leg pain, specifically her lower leg. Upon further discussion, she informs us it’s a problem all the time and asks for medicine (kids motrin). 

We are working with various medical folks to try and diagnose a problem, but so far everything is coming up clean (blood tests, x rays, various other assessments). This is starting to get difficult as we obviously don’t want to medicate her every day, and yet she is adamant her knee(s) hurt every night without fail. Our “solution” currently is to give her a placebo which appears to work. 

I’m not looking for medical advice, but would love the perspective of any parents who have gone through something similar. My #1 fear is being a parent who ignores the danger signs of a more serious condition, so we attempt to seek medical attention as frequently as we can on the subject. At the same time, despite apparently having sore knees “all the time”, she never reports an issue outside of bedtime - notably a time of day she frequently tries to push boundaries. It’s hard to know whether this is a bid for attention / to deflect away from the task at hand (going to bed), and is overall quite a pickle. 

If folks have gone through something similar, I’d love to hear guidance!"

spkygrrl	2021-04-15 23:52:55+00:00	6 YO jealous of 3.5 YO	"The girls largely play well together and occasionally squabble, over a toy or the rules of a game. The standard way we handle it is by encouraging them to handle it themselves which works well most of the time. Sometimes they’ve had enough of each other and take a break from playing, but get back to it with a new game together within a half hour without being promoted. 

The issue is 3.5 is super sweet and supportive of 6, but 6 is very jealous of 3.5. Some examples that are getting to be too much: 6 is in 3 days of in-person school, 3.5 has 2 days of 3 hour pre-k. When 6 was a toddler, we took her to all sorts of museums, classes, zoo, etc. 3.5 has not gotten this, because of COVID and being a younger sibling (the older’s pre-k schedule had to be worked around). Last week I took 3.5 to zoo while 6 was at school. 6 was a wreck about it because it “isn’t fair.” Screamed, kicked, thrashed about, and cried for over an hour about it after school. And even when calm this week she says whining things to us and 3.5 like “It makes me soooo sad nobody took me to the zoo... 3.5 gets her way soo much but I never do.” This happens ANY TIME 3.5 does anything without 6 - but when 6 gets a special outing or treat, she essentially brags and rubs it in 3.5’s face. “I get to go to dinner with mama and you have to stay here!” etc. even though 3.5 - bless her heart - is usually just excited for 6 and says so. To 6 it is unfair she had to go to the orthodontist, that 3.5 got a braid in her hair for picture day (though 6 gets braids just as often if not more because she’ll sit for them better), 3.5 had a longer spring break, 3.5 got to go to the zoo alone, 3.5 had a birthday party at all (6 threw such a fit the whole day because attention wasn’t on her), or even that one dinner we went to a place all of us like that 6 didn’t think she’d like (though every other dinner virtually ever is a place both girls like AND 6 ended up loving the food at this place). 

I am at a loss on what to do. We are modeling as well as we can. We don’t force them to be friends, but they are usually friends. 6 seems to blame us more so than 3.5. We let them work out small issues and we step in with bigger ones but we listen to both sides. They don’t share a room, we respect their right to play alone, we give 6 plenty of solo time... it’s just getting to be so hard. I don’t want to invalidate her feelings but it’s so annoying at this point that most of the time it feels easier to just slight 3.5 and not take her out because she doesn’t mind! Her rivalry concerns involve toys or counting how many M&amp;Ms they both get, not special events or simple outings. This is obviously not a good solution because it GENUINELY isn’t fair to 3.5 but 6 is impossible and we are at a loss on what to do. Any help is appreciated!!! 

TL;DR: 6 YO is jealous of 3 YO getting any solo  attention or outings, but 3 YO is happy for 6 YO getting attention or outings. 6 YO will throw huge fits about the smallest perceived unfairness, like 3 going to zoo or 6 having to go to orthodontist. Desperate for some help! Thx!"

I’m wondering what everyone’s thoughts are on what the appropriate age is for letting your child play outside by themself? 

My daughter is 8, only child. We live in a very quiet neighborhood. Her friends want her to go play at the park which is so close. There is one house behind us and you cross the street and you’re at the park. Takes about 30 seconds to walk there. I feel strange letting her go alone but I see a lot of other kids go play daily without their parents and am wondering if I should give her some freedom. We’ve only been in the neighborhood for about a week and a half as we just moved so I think that’s playing a role too, I’m sure. I’m a pretty cautious parent and just want to know if I’m being too suffocating or if others would hesitate as well! 

She feels ready and wants to go, she’s responsible enough for an 8 yo.

Any thoughts are appreciated!!"

My 19 month old son will only listen /follow directions when he wants to, which is next to never. It's near constant tantrums, if he's not screaming at me about something he's getting into something he's been told to leave alone, or throwing things. I've tried timeouts, he doesn't seem to get it. I've tired taking the things he throws and putting them up for x amount of minutes, and he'll do good for a day and throw it again the next day. Ignoring behaviors we don't want doesn't seem to effect him bc its like he doesn't really care if we are ignoring him. I use a firm voice when telling him he shouldn't do something, when tantrums arise I tell him that I get it its rough not being able to get the words out or the sock doesn't want to cooperate etc.. im out of ideas and feel like I'm not doing something right. 

When I talk with my folks I'm told I'm too soft, that when I was a child I only had a screaming tantrum once before they ""set me straight"",  I should use a more harsh voice with him. I know they mean I should scare him, or physically force him to do what I want him to do."

 I keep seeing “heal yourself before you have children” and I didn’t realize unaddressed childhood trauma comes back to rear its ugly head until after my son was born. I am in no way negative or angry towards my son, but it’s a different story with my husband (the emotional abuse I suffered as a kid comes out) and I become a completely different person.

I hate it so much, and I want so desperately to change my behavior. Has anyone found any resources (podcasts, books, etc.) to overcome/heal from childhood trauma?

Totengeist	2021-04-15 22:10:44+00:00	Occam's razor before MacGyver	"We bought our toddler a VTech baby phone when he was about a year old and he loved it. He played with it everywhere. It eventually ended up in the car somehow and helped him deal with long drives. My point being it got a *lot* of use.

Eventually it stopped working properly. The slider that switches from ""music"" to ""apps"" had been misaligned for over a month already and finally the ""touchscreen"" stopped working. The physical buttons still worked fine.

Since having kids, I've been preparing myself for low quality toys that need to be replaced occasionally. I'm an IT technician and am fairly comfortable dealing with simple electronics and my wife is also very tech-savvy, so we grabbed a screw driver and carefully pulled the toy apart.

I was expecting poor soldering to have caused a loose connection, but after fixing the misaligned slider there were no other issues to be found. After several minutes of fruitless checking, it dawns on us: the batteries are dying.... Apparently, there was enough current to power the buttons and slider, but not the touchscreen.

I've worked in IT for over a decade and forgot what almost amounts to turning it off and on again. Advice I give on a regular basis at work.

We've since had to take apart a Linkimal with a wonky switch and were successful in that endeavor, so I was able to redeem myself.

TLDR: A toy wasn't working properly, so we took it apart only to eventually realize the problem was dying batteries, not mechanical failure. When a toy is acting up, always try replacing the batteries before performing surgery."
yromeM_yggoF	2021-04-15 22:10:06+00:00	Pre-school for 3 year old. What would you do?	"I want to get some other parents’ opinions, because I have mixed feelings on this. I am a high school teacher at a small private school, and I have the opportunity to have my son go here for free next year, and he would be in pre-school (he will be 3 this week). My wife stays home with our newborn and 3 year old son, so I know it can be difficult for her to keep them both happy, so on the one hand, this could give my son a lot more interaction with other kids and help with his social development. Plus, he would be near me, which is another benefit, as I can see him at lunch and recess sometimes. I also trust the teachers here, we have the same beliefs, the classes are smaller, there’s not a lot of discipline issues, and a free private school education is hard to beat.

However, I have a few reservations. The school is in a major city, and we live about an hour away in a small rural area, so when he makes friends, they won’t live nearby. I’ve heard the closest district to our home is good, but I don’t know personally. Also, if I were to ever leave my school (not saying I will, just an “if”) we can’t afford the tuition, so he would have to change schools. Also, just as far as starting my son at 3 goes, I have mixed feelings as well. We live on 17 wooded acres, so part of me wants him to just be able to run around and be a kid for a long as possible before going to school. But again, my wife is very occupied with our newborn, so he might not be outside as much as he used to be.

And that’s my dilemma. I’m a major over-thinker,  so I’d love to see how some of you weigh these pros and cons, what you’d lean to, your experiences, or any thoughts you have."
highinisolation	2021-04-15 22:05:00+00:00	My mom is “forcing” me into being a pilot	"I’m 19 and in my first year of college. I’m going to a school with a good aviation program, which my mom has encouraged because she strongly believes I’ll love being a pilot. I do very much love traveling. Soon, I have to apply to get into the actual aviation program but I don’t REALLY want to. I kind of feel like she’s forcing me to do something I don’t want to do. And I’ve told her before that I don’t really want to pursue being a pilot but she always blows me off, and says wait til you first get in that pilot seat.

It all started my senior year of high school, when she got me a private flight for my 18th bday in Arizona which I did love but she always says it’s when “I fell in love with flying” but no that’s just what she wants to think

It was soon later she discovered I had been a daily weed smoker, but that didn’t deter her from wanting me to be a pilot. I actually quit weed 2 months ago, but I still want to go back to that and just not pursue being a pilot.

The struggle I have tho is that I don’t know what else I would want to do besides being a pilot. Because I suck at most things and I never want a desk job. I also have an amazing busboy job, in which I make average of 22 dollars an hour. So she thinks I will just get stuck working in restaurants my whole life. Which I don’t want

I really want to sit down and talk with her again and tell her how I feel, but she has always insisted on being the type of mom who “doesn’t force her child to do what they don’t want to do” yet she is forcing me into this. I think she doesn’t even see what she’s doing. What can I say to get through to her?"

I am exhausted with parenting and at my limit. I have a ten year old autistic/adhd son and I had a mental breakdown today and not sure how to move forward.

It's just me and my ex girlfriend raising him. No one else. Neither of us have parents (mine are dead, so are hers). Im estranged from my family who live in another state, and she only has 4 relatives she talks to who live 6 hours away.

Needless to say it sucks. Our son has basically no family outside of us. We can't afford any child care, so when we broke up 3 years ago we have been passing him between the two houses every day. My ex works day shift and i work night shift. So I get him during the day and she watches him at night.

However it's clear I got the worst deal. Before the pandemic every single fucking school day I would get a call during my sleep hours (I sleep during the day because I work late nights) about his behavior or have to pick him up. During the pandemic it's worse because he's distance learning so now im basically a teacher during my sleep hours. It was fine for the few months I was unemployed but now I'm back at work and losing my mind.

I'm sleep deprived and angry all the time. I scream at my son over everything. Every little thing upsets me. I'm resenting him and my situation.

I have no social life since i watch him 6 days a week since my ex also works Saturday for extra hours. I have not dated once since the break up because I don't have time! How can I date when I'm never free?

It's causing me to hate my child and I feel horrible. I cannot get therapy as I literally have no time. Every hour that cuts into my sleep causes me distress. 

Hell this week I had to not only do school stuff with my son but take him to several doctor appointments and got 4 hours of sleep a day. I'm beyond done. I keep counting the days till he is 18 and I can leave forever. I feel terrible for thinking this. I feel if I just was given the chance to sleep and have a life I wouldn't feel this way about my son. Our relationship is suffering. My ex will not cut hours as she needs the over time to afford bills. I am now reliant on sleep meds to get any sleep and I hate it. 
I hate meds in general.

spoopypoopydoops	2021-04-15 21:27:58+00:00	I think my child inherited anxiety	"My daughter 6F is wonderful in so many ways. I feel really lucky to be her mom and want to do the best I can for her. Her dad (my ex) and I both have anxiety disorders, and she is exhibiting some signs of anxiety. I intend to speak to her doctor about it soon, but I'm currently unable to drive due to a recently broken leg, so it will have to wait a few weeks sadly.

I'm not asking for medical advice of course, but I'm wondering if anyone has read any helpful books about raising an anxious child that I should check out. Every child deals with big feelings that we must teach them how to cope with, but I have a limited skillet on helping a small child navigate anxiety. I have tried deep breathing techniques, yoga, talking it out, etc, but it doesn't seem to be helping very much.

As I said, I do intend to speak to a doctor, and I intend to find a child therapist to assist her, but until I'm more mobile, I think learning about childhood anxiety may help me help her.

And to add before I get questions, no, she has not had a particularly difficult life. Her father and I split when she was 1, and she has a wonderful relationship with her father, her stepfather, and myself. All of her needs are being met, and we support her hobbies and interests. We do not yell or use corporal punishment. She has friends and family that love her, and we have a few pets that bring us a lot of love and joy. I think it's just an unfortunate genetic trait she may have inherited."

The opportunity to be with my children is limited due to work schedule and our custody rotation. With this time being limited  I feel it would be selfish of me if I kept them away from their friends and after school activities while it was my time with them. So I often let them go to friends and other activities unless we have special plans.  I also struggle with fear of people seeing me as someone that just lets his kids go and don't spend time with them.

I emailed the room mom and haven’t heard back. I’m not even sure if it’s her correct email address and have no where to verify if it is because room parent emails are never sent out. I don’t have a Facebook account but I guess I could make one for this occasion and still would not be sure how to find mom’s from her specific class on the PTO site without being awkward.

LookingForHobbits	2021-04-15 20:55:07+00:00	Independent 2yo Troubles	"Hoping that some of you have been through this before and might have some resources we can look into. 

We have a very bright newly two year old who is amazing... until you try to transition him to an activity he doesn't want to do. If he's willing he'll just follow/lead you to the next task/activity without issue, but when he's engaged in something he doesn't want to stop (ie: playing outside or taking a bath) he'll throw massive tantrum when it comes time to move on to the next thing, or even for a momentary break (like a diaper change).

We weren't too concerned with this when it happened at home as it's typically near the start/end of the day and we assumed he was just tired or hungry on top of being a two year old but we just had a conference with daycare and it turns out this now happens every time they come in from playing outside, every nap, and every diaper change. It's becoming very disruptive and even their most experienced staff are stumped because things that motivate other toddlers don't seem to work on ours. 

Once you get him to start a new activity he's usually fine, and if you're willing to wait 15 minutes he'll typically willingly move on to the next task (so he'll say ""no"" to a diaper change and instead play with toys but then he'll suddenly decide he's ready and get changed. Also before it's suggested: he has no interest in potty training yet and a perfect poker face) but that's not something that daycare can reasonably do.

Any ideas or resources would be helpful."

I'm really frustrated with my parents, mostly my mom, it just seems like she wants nothing to do with my kids, they are my step kids but I consider them my children. It just seems like every time we need help with anything at all my mom tries and finds a way to get out of it completely she'll come up with excuses and pretty much just break our hearts every time we try to ask for help.

It's gotten to the point where me and my wife feel like we can't even depend on my mom for anything, my wife's parents help us out with everything and anything they can at any moment no matter what. When it comes to my parents though we might as well just not even ask, we even ask a week ahead of time to make sure there's plenty of time to make plans but instead of saying sure she'll tell us let me make sure I'm not doing anything this weekend first, which means to me let me make plans first so that I can cancel on y'all.

Has anyone else had this problem with their parents not wanting to watch their kids or help out with their kids? I'm sorry for the crappy formatting I'm using mobile and I'm using voice to text because I'm lazy and I don't want to text this out LOL"
Reality-Check-2019	2021-04-15 20:28:39+00:00	My child won't stop holding food in his mouth	"My son is almost 2. 

I'm struggling to get him to eat properly (as a lot of parents do). I'm working on that and slowly getting him to eat a variety of foods. 

But my biggest struggle has been he likes to hold food in his mouth. I will literally catch him with food in his mouth almost an hour after a meal. And it's not always a lot of food. It's just small little chunks I find in the back of his cheeks. Then I'm forced to have to get it out with my fingers. And now he has a mouth full of teeth so it's like sticking my finger into a piranhas mouth. 

I tried only giving him a few bites of food on his plate at a time but it's still happening. Even if I cut his food into tiny peices. 

Has anyone else had this problem? I really need some advice on how to fix this. I know it can really mess up his teeth if this doesn't stop. 

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!"
sarawrrra	2021-04-15 20:17:34+00:00	Just turned 3 year old having constant meltdowns	"Hello parents! My daughter just turned 3 at the end of March and she started preschool the Monday after her birthday. She was good for about a week, but then it was like a switch flipped. Constant tantrums, never ending screaming. From what I’ve been reading it sounds rather normal, I think, but my husband and I are definitely struggling with the screaming.

She’s been doing great at school, so no problems there. I was thinking it might just be her adjusting to the new routine but it’s been three weeks now and she’s just barely starting to have better days. Part of it has definitely been me, because the screaming gets me so stressed out that I have unfortunately reacted poorly, but I have been working very hard to maintain my composure and model the behavior that I have wanted to see. Up until yesterday, there were multiple tantrums every day at things not going her way and also at nap and bedtime. Our routine will go fairly smoothly and then once it’s time for me to leave the room, she will get up and scream and cry. If I go back and comfort her, she will be fine while I am there and then lose it again the second I turn to leave. We have been letting her cry it out at that point, and had gotten the crying time down to only two minutes and then finally she went down without a fight yesterday. Today, she screamed at me the whole time we changed into her pull up so she got a consequence of no stories before bed, which obviously didn’t go over well and resulted in more screaming. 

I guess I’m just looking for some validation that we’re not torturing her by letting her cry it out. Some advice that I’ve read has said not to do that, but if we keep going back in to her room the cycle just repeats itself and she will go on forever.  I’m also looking for some advice on how to deal with the tantrums. I’ve heard the basic “tell them it’s okay to be upset, it’s not okay to scream at mommy” but I can’t do that until she’s stopped screaming, and she can go on for quite a while. 

For some background, she has a speech delay and has been in speech therapy and has moved into preschool, which has helped tremendously with her language skills. She is trying so many new words daily. She is my first baby and I hardly have any other experience with kids her age, so it can be hard to tell what is normal and what is not. 

So, fellow parent warriors, what advice and commiseration can you give me?  TIA!"
Nearby_Golf	2021-04-15 20:03:20+00:00	"We stopped play dates bec of COVID, another parent disagrees and was disrespectful"	"Sorry for the long post. And thank you in advance for listening.... My 3yr old son is bffs with our 3yr old neighbor who lives a few houses down. They just click and always happy and excited to see each other. Our families spent a lot of time together last summer (without masks) since we were all careful and all work from home. Until the husband went back to work and got exposed to COVID frequently. We stopped hanging out with them when I would find out that the husband would get tested for covid and it appears to me that they are not properly quarantining and still went on play dates with us. I just absolutely do not trust the mother because my son (and the rest of my family) also have gotten sick a couple of times in the past because she would allow her daughter play with my son even though she’s running fever with cough and congestion. Her main priority is about her daughter not socializing enough with other kids.

So we haven’t seen them for a few months, and they stopped by the other day  to drop off my son’s bday present. I told her that we started spending time with the grandparents who are diabetics and with heart conditions so we are still careful. Me and my son wore our masks and they didn’t, which I thought was disrespectful. She said that “they are so over COVID” and I see on Facebook that they go to a lot of indoor places and go to gatherings without masks. I honestly don’t have anything against that. The level of protection that you do for covid is your own personal choice. It’s none of my business. She also said that she doesn’t understand why I still don’t let my son play with her daughter because her in laws who live next door to them are already fully vaccinated. I don’t know what she meant by that, it didn’t make sense to me. She also said other things that I couldn’t understand. And I just didn’t appreciate the tone of her voice at all. We saw them across the street a few days ago, my son was so happy and said hi from far away and tried to talk to his friend but she ignored us completely and dragged her daughter and walked away quickly.

I really want to confront her about this but my husband said that my son would lose his friend if I do. I do want them to go on play dates again when the rates go down since both me and my husband are vaccinated. My neighbors refuse to get vaccinated which I have nothing against. Your body, your choice. But I will be more careful around people who are not vaccinated. 

So my question is.... confront her? Or not?"

Around the 12 month mark we started by taking his pacifier away during the day time and letting him have it at night.  He does not miss it during the day at all. We take it from him first thing in the morning. But he relies on it for nap time. It's a que for him, because as soon as I notice he is tired , we go to his room , I sit him in the crib ,  I hand him his paci and he is out. Same goes for night time. Which I like, because he knows its bedtime when he gets the paci and its an easy bedtime routine for us.  


But I feel like I may be creating a bad habit and that he will forever rely on it to go to sleep. Should I just stop giving it to him for naps and at night cold turkey? Any advise is much appreciated!"
Guyserbun007	2021-04-15 19:21:34+00:00	Should I stop my 3-year from playing in the park due to exclusion from her peers?	"My kid is 3 year old, and she is doing well at preschool. Teachers also said she interacts well with other kids there. However, since she is one of the youngest and smallest, after school, when we brought her to the park nearby, she really wants to play with and be part of her peer's group, but because of her size, younger age, and she doesn't talk a lot, other kids tend to exclude her (i.e., push her away, ignore her, or running away from her as a group), and I think this is quite traumatic to her and causing her to feel socially-excluded as she is very in-tuned and sensitive. I think it may be better for her to stop going to that park until my daughter is a bit bigger and more talkative. Is it the right move? If not, any suggestions?"

My 4,5 month (3,5 adjusted) old boy sleeps being swaddled until now because of his startling. He is a really bad sleeper since das one. He is not sleep trained but we got him so far that he sleeps in his crip next to us. Now he started rolling around and using his hands pretty much at the same time. Because of his rolling we can’t use the swaddle bag anymore but now he has a problem with his newly discovered hands. He has absolutely no control of them. He has them always in his face or mouth so he can’t fall asleep or wakes himself up really often. Because of this he is crying for hours until we pick him up ( falls asleep being held because his arms are secured in a comfortable way). He pulls pacifiers out of his mouth immediately and starts screaming bloody murder.

How can we get him to sleep without swaddling his arms anymore? What’s a way of controlling his arms? I am still not comfortable sleeptraining him until since he isn’t 4 month adjusted..."

Audreythe2nd	2021-04-15 18:58:14+00:00	"I'm having trouble distinguishing ""normal"" four year old behaviour during a pandemic"	"Is anyone else having this problem? My four year old started getting defiant and coupling that defiance with tantrums around the time of his birthday, and this also coincided with some further restrictions in our province, not getting to see his cousins, grandmother anymore, etc. The worst of his meltdowns seem to center around being disappointed at not getting to do something fun, or having to leave a place where he is having fun. Even as I type that out it *sounds* normal in theory, and especially during this stupid time period where nearly everything has been taken away from kids. And developmentally I know four year olds are infamous for challenging authority. It's just tough to manage his feelings with the age and his actions sometimes (my husband has had to carry him kicking and screaming from a park pretty recently, and that didn't start happening until he turned 4). My husband is a family doctor and has mentioned for us to keep an eye on it if it doesn't decrease by age 4.5... but that seems kind of arbitrary to me considering everything going on around us. He doesn't go to school at all yet (he was pulled from part time daycare last year and his been home with me and his 1 year old brother for over a year now), so maybe the bigger tell will be his behaviour when he gets there? 

Is anyone else confused by their own kid like this? I want to give him what he needs to cope, but I also don't know if I have the proper perspective on what's normal for a four year old boy. Any thoughts or anecdotes? Are your ""typically normal"" children angrier, melting down more often, experimenting with defying your authority, etc.? This sounds like such a basic question, but I'd really like to have a conversation about it to get some perspective here."

I blame myself for most of it because when me and her mom separated when she was 5 and when I had her I chose easy food over nutrition. Now she is 7 and if she’s not eating McDonald’s chicken Nuggets, bread, noodles with no sauce, or cheese pizza. Since I’ve been with my fiancé now going on 2 years we have attempted multiple times to get her to try new food. It’s difficult to try and keep her on a routine when I only have her Wednesday through saturday before she goes back to her BM. Her BM tells me she tries to get her to eat other food or at least try but I am not sure if she is telling the truth. 

My attempts lately have been telling her what we are having for dinner that night and she can either eat it or go without the entire night. She will constantly choose to not eat. So far my menu has been sloppy joes, hot dogs, pot roast, and tacos. Any tips or help would be appreciated. I do not want my daughter to be unhealthy and only eat fried food or cheese pizza.

My parents (Coco and Papa), my grandma (Grandma C), my husbands mom and step dad (Nonnie and Grandpa), my husbands grandma (Mimi), and my husbands bio dad. My parents see my son at least once a week and FaceTime him nearly daily and he adores them. He spends the night with them occasionally and frequently spends the day at their house. We see my grandma on once a month or so, and pre-Covid we saw her every other Sunday. My son is always asking to go to Grandma C’s house and gets super excited when we go over. He never wants to leave! We see my husbands mom, step dad, and grandma a lot less since they live further away. Our son loves when they come over but I don’t think he fully grasps that they are his grandparents. As for my husbands bio dad, he has never even met our son and has never asked to. I honestly forget that he has another grandparent. We haven’t even bothered to tell him about his other grandparent because there doesn’t seem to be a point. 

I was super close with my grandma (Grandma C) and my grandpa before he passed. I knew my dad’s dad, but we were never close. He tried to have a relationship with my sister and I after his health started to decline, but he passed rather quickly. 

How many grandparents do your children have? Do they have good relationships? I’m genuinely curious about what seems to be the norm with grandparents."

"Today, my older son pushed his baby brother in the stroller in a running manner (I looked away for a split second) which resulted in the stroller flipping over and the baby landing (although buckled in) face forward straight onto the concrete.  

We had to get a head screening done and luckily the bruises are all he's got.   

My son though only seemed concerned about the consequences of his actions: possible time out, taking away toys, tablet. He didn't seem one bit concerned about the baby's well being.    

Upon asking him later what his thoughts are on that event he stated that he felt a little sorry for the baby but doesn't see what the big deal is since he's alive with a bruised cheek. He added that he is happy though to have found out how easy it is to push the stroller with his brother in it and run, too. 

Also, my FIL, his favorite grandparent has Covid and is in bad shape, to which my son simply said that he doesn't care about it.  

Is this normal? Are we as parents doing something wrong? Do we need to help him learn empathy or will it come as he gets older?"

For board games, If we roll the dice and I happen to get the higher number, he’ll refuse to let me go first lol. He doesn’t care if the peg is supposed to go on one square at a time, he’ll skip 10 squares without a care in the world. If I try to gently remind him of the game rules, he’ll say “I’m doing it my own way!” and will continue what he’s doing, or just run away. And that’s that!

myblasphemouslife	2021-04-15 17:30:30+00:00	Sharing my pain with my husband doesn't seem to register with him sometimes	"31f + 40m

It sometimes feels like he is not capable of comprehending the situation from my place. Or understand the pain I feel when something opens that door or how to respond.

I have 1 son (special needs 10yrs old full custody) from a former marriage. He has no children at all. We agreed due to too many reasons to list (it boils form to a responsibility matter mostly regarding my current son) we won't have a child and it'll be just us 3. We are comfortable balanced and happy as it is. 

Im on the copper iud and my period is late. I took a test and it was negative. I cried. I deeply want a 2nd child but I've accepted it's simply not the right or responsible decision for our family and I need to move on. I'm pretty good at compartmentalizing and this doesn't bother me most of the time but things like this force that door open and it hurts. 

If I accidentally became pregnant I would be thrilled and I know we both would want to keep it. But the intentional decision to have a child with the knowledge I have of all the factors is not a decision I want to make and have the lifelong resulting anxiety and guilt of ""I/we made this decision so it's my/our fault this is happening"" anytime negative things pertaining to having a 2nd child come up (which is a guarantee). I don't have that problem with my son now because he was not planned. He just happened. He also happened back when I didn't believe in abortion. 

Anyway. My husband doesn't seem to understand how to support me in this pain. There's no actual connection. I tell him but it's like there's nothing there but ""im sorry"" and ""it makes me so sad that this hurts you"". I know he's honestly trying. But there's nothing that can make him truly relate to my situation from my place. He has no children of his own. The monumental cognitive shift that happens after you have children just can't be artificially created. 

If anyone here can relate to any of this id love to hear from you if you care to share your experiences. Please no judgment. It's been a rough day."

TheWhiskeySour	2021-04-15 17:18:04+00:00	Am I expecting too much from my almost 5 year old? Or am I just on overload?	"As the title states, I'm trying to figure out if I'm expecting too much, if he's behaving ""badly"" or if I'm just on overload and losing it over the little things. 

A bit of background-
We stopped going to preschool in March 2020 because of COVID. That meant that I couldn't work anymore since he wasn't at school, so I'm a stay at home mom. Which honestly I usually love. But the last few weeks I've been walking a very fine line of keeping my temper and trying to not go crazy. I've been battling major depressive disorder for practically my entire life, and it's well managed, but I do realize when it rears its ugly head, and have been hyper aware of it and working with my doctor on med changes. I do as much as I can for self care, but there are never enough hours in the day to get what I actually need, despite a helpful spouse and my best friend who has been my quarantine buddy for the last year taking my son when I just can't anymore.  

The issue-
No matter what I ask, it takes 10 times as long as necessary for him to do whatever it is that I ask him to do. Put on socks? It takes 10 minutes, typically including a few minutes to decide on socks, then wondering around the house looking at things, then pretending to not know how to put them on, or letting the dog steal them on purpose and using that as an excuse to chase him around the house, until FINALLY, usually after threatening to take away some privilege, he'll get the socks on. Copy and paste for any other task. Getting dressed, going to the bathroom, eating dinner, etc. You get the idea. He refuses to do anything on his own unless it's in front of a screen, and we already watch so much more TV than we should, it's kind of ridiculous. He's an only child, but so am I, and I know that at his age I was playing for hours by myself with very little need for my parents to engage and play with me. 

I feel like he's very willfully ignoring me and pushing my buttons on purpose, but I can't decide if it's just regular 5 year old behavior, me being way too on edge and irritable, or him actually acting out in a way that needs to be dealt with from a disciplinary perspective. As I write this he's throwing coins around on his train table, nearly broke the piggy bank, and is now whining that I told him he needs to put them back in and that ""putting them one by one will take FOOOOORRRRREEEEEVVVVVERRRRRRRR"" while not actually trying to get them back in. 

I don't know what I expect from this post. I think chances are that I'm over reacting and he's just being a typical kid, but I'm on my last nerve and honestly am questioning everything about my parenting at the moment.

Thanks for reading."

I didn't hit. But that impulse to hit has obviously been set in my brain.

I'm so ashamed. I don't deserve my children.

I am in therapy, have been for a long time. But (not making excuses) this lockdown, financial stress, exhaustion and burn out has me at my wit's end.

I'm on mobile. I don't have energy to edit my post for typos or whatnot. I just needed to ""confess"". I thought I had ""beaten the cycle"". But there I was. Hand raised. Ready."

"My mom and dad have been married for over 40 years (and 4 kids) but it's not been a happy marriage. I'm sure there was something there at first but then it faded over time. They bicker quite a bit more now but even when growing up, it was like watching two warring sides. I'm not saying that parents don't fight, it's just I never really saw them in love much. 

I'm just wondering, isn't the ""we have to stay together for the kids"" approach worse for the kids because then innevitably tensions boil over and the kids see what a compromise marriage looks like and that's how it shapes their world going forward?"

Googila	2021-04-15 16:49:13+00:00	Video games	"Looking for advice. I can’t decide if I should be concerned or shouldn’t worry much about it. 

Son is 12 years old. Our jurisdiction has been in and out of lockdown since November, so seeing friends after school is technically illegal. He’s seen his friends a couple times when COVID case numbers were lower, but they’re much higher now, so it’s not happening. To make matters worse, he has spent probably half of the last calendar year out of school due to closures and is now on spring break and will be attending school virtually starting next week. 

During non-school hours, he spends most of his time playing video games - I’m talking like most hours of the day. He’ll stop to eat, and once approached to do chores, outdoor activity, and family time, he will quickly put his games away without any trouble, but left to his own devices, he would probably game all day. This is because he plays with all of his school friends.  They play in teams together so it allows him to connect with them. I don’t love the idea of video games to this level, but it’s the primary way he can connect and bond with his friends.

Should I be limiting this?  Just curious on everyone’s thoughts."

enlightenedkitty	2021-04-15 16:26:45+00:00	Daughters narcissistic bff.	"Few years ago my daughter made friends with this girl at school and things were going great till i started to get a lot of phone calls from their mutual teacher complaining about my daughters behaviour with her friend. He told me the girl my daughter had made friends with was trouble and was having a hard time at home ( her parents split there was a step parent that went to jail and she was constantly acting up at school).
She was a mean bully girl that if you werent with her you were against her and my daughter felt safer being in her circle then out of it which would make her a target for her friends bully behaviour. 
I had phone calls once a week sometimes twice. For months while teachers and myself tried to deal with this. 
Her bio mom didnt even live in town her dad had custody of her. 

Now flash forward her mother a year into their friendship moved back into town and her parents now had shared custody. The mother whos ex is in jail (i dont know why) married a new guy and has been trying to be a perfect wife mother online on Facebook. In my opinion shes very fake.

Her mother and i have never discussed their school issues ive tried bringing it up but she glosses over and whenever the girls have a falling out she tries to get involved and her and i have discussions on what we both want to see from our girls so they can be friends and not have conflict. But its hard to explain to my daughter that her friend is very narcissistic and thats why they are butting heads. 

When her friend comes over she is very stuck on outward appearances and talks about how perfect her life is at her moms house with their green smoothies and kale salads and everything is very mean girls time personality. Not educated talks at all. 

My daughter saw her asking for sympathy online and she told her that it would make her a target for bullies for putting herself out there all vulnerable and her friend took offence and now they are not talking.  

I dont know how many times ive told my daughter how bad this girls mind can be for her and for her not to follow suit because thats very toxic. I cant control my kids but i can guide them and tell them that beauty is on the inside and that all you have is your character at the end of the day. 

My daughter of course is upset that years of friendship and having to see her around but not be friends is hurtful. I dont know what else to do or say to her to help her feel better about this."
Trepidatious681	2021-04-15 16:24:16+00:00	Explaining to a toddler (2.5) that mommy is having surgery? Books about parents having it?	"I'm having laparoscopic abdominal surgery at the end of this month and I want to discuss it with my toddler but am unsure of how.

It's not for a serious condition so it's not like I'm sick, it's more preventative. Since it's laparoscopic it is a day surgery, I will have it while she's at daycare and will be back before she gets back. But I will be out of commission for awhile. I will basically be bed-ridden for 3 days minimum, then exhausted for another 3 days. After that I will be able to do things at a gradually increasing level, but I won't be able to pick her up for 4-6 weeks.

I'm a very active mom and am unsure of how to prepare her that I won't be doing much of anything for days and much less for weeks. I looked for books about surgery for toddlers but only found them about kids having surgery, not about mommy. If books aren't an option I would also just like advice about how to explain it to her without scaring her.

Thanks!"

Mostly when I was passing by other parents at our daycare. It was strange, it was nobodies birthday, nothing special. I just let it slide.

Until I spoke to the daycare worker today and she told me she was so happy for us. I asked her why and she looked shocked. She told me our daughter had been talking about her little sister in mommies belly. Our daughter told everybody who wanted to hear she was going to be a big sister.

Problem is: I'm not pregnant. 
When I asked our daughter about it she said: ""yes you are mommy, look at your big belly."" I always thought I had a pretty normal belly, but thanks love.

She went to my in laws this week so I guess I have to make a call now."

mrsfiction	2021-04-15 15:58:18+00:00	Advice for tough conversation: we eat animals	"So, my daughter is almost 2. And she loves animals. At her grandparents’ house she has nine pet chickens. She loves them and plays with them and feeds them. 

While we don’t eat meat at every meal, we are not vegetarians, and we do eat more chicken than anything else. The thing is, my daughter is quick and now that she’s familiar with chickens the living creatures, I’ve stopped using the term chicken to refer to food. We say meat or tenderloins or thighs. I’m just not ready for her to make that connection and have that conversation. I think in part because it was really hard for me to come around to that as a kid. 

I want my kid to have a healthy relationship with food and with animals. I don’t want her to be scared of accidentally eating a pet (again, that one’s on me). 

Am I overreacting to and overthinking this? Has anyone else needed to talk to their kids about this? Are there books I can read to wrap my head around the healthiest mindset for this?"

My daughter is excellent at school. She behaves and listens and is very playful with her classmates. At home is another story, she still throws intense tantrums often and it can take her an hour to calm down. Worse thing is that sometimes we don’t know what triggers her. 

For example we gave her syrup over whipped cream on pancakes. Instant meltdown. She didn’t get a few more minutes in the iPad. Instant meltdown. 

This morning she woke up came to our room the. Went back to her own room to have a meltdown. We didn’t even know what happen. 

We’ve try to let her cool down and come back to talk, and we to make sure we let her know mom and dad are near when she is ready so we are no in her face tying to “solve” the situation. 

All that is okay but it’s come to the point where thing trigger almost everyday at least twice a day. Sometimes it’s for ridiculous reasons as I mention, but this gets real challenging when we want to enforce discipline. “No you can’t have that” or “it’s not time for this” get met with a full on blow out. It adds much, much stress and complication to an already hectic life. 

We are late for school or bedtime drags until 9:00 or 9:30 when it should be 8:00 or sooner. 

I am unsure of what to do now. It’s like my kid is out of control at home but is perfectly fine following rules and being calm at school."

"My in-laws are now fully vaccinated against covid and will be visiting us and our 2-year-old daughter soon. My husband and I will be partially vaccinated at the time of their visit, but obviously our daughter will not be. I have a very low risk tolerance and feel like we just don't know enough yet about long-term effects of covid (including in children) and the extent to which it can spread through vaccinated people. With that in mind, I would like for their visit to take place outdoors with masks if close together, but no masks is fine if further apart. In the future when covid cases are much lower in the community or we learn more about the risks, I'd be willing to take fewer precautions. Until then, are my requests to stay outdoors and wear masks when close crazy? Am I being unreasonable?"

They have the upmost respect for their step mother as well. They do not have behavior problems at school and are very receptive to their tournament baseball coaches. 

I do my best to never turn them against their mother, I always try and support her parenting style at her house. I am constantly getting phone calls to calm my 8 year old down or I am having to literally scold them over the phone or face time (which I feel is not fair to me). 

It’s been this way for a long time, she’s getting married to her boyfriend, fiance, then ex fiancé, and ex/new fiancé (all same guy). She has insisted on him being an authority at her house, yet the boys have zero trust or respect for him.

The students of the University would create groups and hire professors to teach. If students felt satisfied, they would hire and pay the professor again.

Students were the boss!

Gradually, good professors came together and turned the tables around.

Ironically, the student was still paying, but the recipient was the boss. Contrary to other jobs!

However, things are more relaxed now. I strongly believe every child deserves to have a time during every day to have a break and that may include going outside at least occasionally. I emailed my principal a few weeks ago about if we were allowed to go outside or not. She replied and said we can occasionally take them outside.

Today, another teacher in my grade and I took our students outside and some of the other grade level teachers were very angry because their kids saw us going outside. They said it is not fair to their kids.
Do you think I am in the wrong? Should I have not taken my kids out?
I don’t want to create a toxic community by going against another teachers wishes, however, I got approval from the principal and it is up to her if she wants to take her kids out or not.

What should I do in the future? I am a first year teacher who doesn’t want to make any other experienced teachers mad, but also need to give these kids a break."

I am still missing 99 books from last year. I’ve asked my last years kids and keep getting variations of “I dunno” and “I don’t have anything.” I do know one person has several but every time I ask they say they’ll bring them in but never do. 

This year has been better. I’m only missing about 30.

Anyways, what’s a normal amount of books to lose in a class library and how do you handle book hoarders? I have at least two this year and one actually reads the books and the other just brings them home and doesn’t read them."

  We work well together and things have been progressing.  

Every once in a while a few other EA's call out and the administration pulls my EA to go do recess and lunch. I don't see her anymore. Then I have to get creative with classroom management.  


I talked to the school resource lady, and she passed me to the principal.  I emailed the principal and he kind of shrugged and suggested I talk to the other sped teacher- the qualified one- and see if they could give me ideas how to differentiate with sped. 

It is not fair and illegal to boot. 
I asked the sped teacher and they said If my EA gets pulled I should make all the sped students go to the sped room. 



My first question is;  Should my Sped students have more qualified help than an EA? 
And second is,  what should I do? I don't want to stigmatize these students by kicking them out every time the EA is busy. I don't want to ignore them and their needs either. 
My recourse thus far has been to have high level students be my little teachers and play sight word and math fact games. 
How can I improve or work this out? The principle already suggested I try to figure out a way to manage the situation when it happens, so he seems complacent or at least apathetic.. 

Or should I just take a few sick days and forget about the whole miserable tangled mess?"
ThinkingBook2	2021-04-29 01:17:32+00:00	No Zeros?	"So.... Our district is slowly shifting to PCBL learning. We know very little about the next steps but the first step began this past fall. No more zeros, only 50%. 

We assumed this would only be for COVID, but it is a permanent measure for our district now. Teachers across the district are angry because with the particular students we teach, it becomes challenging. Students this year are already “gaming” the system and turning in minimal amounts of work to scoot by with a 60. I’m sure they are not learning much, with COVID on top of everything.

Are there any teachers out there that have PCBL in their districts? How is it going for you? Is it effective (before COVID, I guess I should say)? What are the advantages and challenges?"

One of my kids typed Happy Birthday to me (it wasn't my birthday, they were just being silly)  in the Zoom chat and all the kids were asking me how old I was and I said it wasn't my birthday but I am 45.  I might as well be 245345243 years old because they couldn't believe it.  Some comment gems were:

\-OMG you were alive when T.V.'s were SQUARES!!!

\-You've lived through so many decades!  You must have seen so many changes! (fair enough but they were acting like I took a horse and buggy to school). 

\-Did you like to watch Gilligan's Island?  

\-Was your T.V. black and white?

\-I can't believe you remember the 70's!!!! That's just crazy!!  That's is soooooo long ago!!!!!

There are many other hilarious comments and I was laughing so hard tears were spilling down my face.  It was a day I will remember for a long time!"
ProperPolicy	2021-04-28 23:57:40+00:00	Locking Chromebooks to an app?	"Hi,

I hope this belongs in this sub. This is a question about teaching in a classroom with multiple grades, say 7, 8, and 9, and using Chromebooks.

The students have Chromebooks and for a 75 minute math block, the teacher is doing 25 minutes direct instruction for each grade. While the teacher is teaching one group, the other groups are on mathletics/prodigy/whatever (an online learning platform, or some other in person learning activity). Is there a way to lock Chromebooks to a certain website/app just for that certain time? I've heard of kiosk mode, is it the solution I'm looking for and able to just be in kiosk mode for a certain set schedule?

Thanks in advance"
eacks29	2021-04-28 22:04:27+00:00	working as an educational aide?	"hi all, I’ve currently been teaching for a few years (one as a daycare teacher and 3 as an elementary teacher in a charter school). My current job situation, the charter school, is not a good fit for me and I’d like to progress my career in a good public school district in my area. There are not many openings and a LOT of applicants in my area for full time teaching positions, but I have the opportunity to interview for an educational aide in a great district and school.

Should I go for it? I feel bad taking a pay cut and a “step back” so to speak, but I’m hopeful that getting my foot in the door as an aide will help me land a full time teaching position in this district in the future. Thoughts?"
hibyechickenpie	2021-04-28 19:07:10+00:00	Considering leaving medicine for teaching	"Usually I would post this on the medical school sub but I wanted to get the other sides advice. Throwaway bc of personal info.

Im about to finish my first year of med school and I genuinely dont enjoy it. Nor am I good at it. Its been a rough year and from the literal first day of school I have been questioning whether this was the right decision for me. I dream of quitting, moving back home, and becoming a teacher.

Some background about me: I am 21 years old living in the US. Graduated college 2 years early and went straight into med school. Majored in Neuroscience in undergrad which I loved. Never really explored anything outside of medicine since I was in a time crunch to graduate.

Reasons I'm doubting medicine:

-Cost: I have no financial support and am taking out full loans. Im expected to graduate with around 500k in debt. If I go into peds, residency pay will be about 50k/yer for 3 years. After those three years I'm looking at being paid around 100k.

-Teaching: I have always loved teaching. I've taught at a sunday school for 6 years and while I know thats different from typical teaching it has still given me some insight on the field. Kids are great and I have a great bond with them. I am planning on doing pediatrics if I continue medicine. Most parents of kids that I teach are really happy with me as a teacher and tell me their kid loves me. Ive even been reach out to by these parents in order to privately tutor their kids because of how much they like my teaching. This is not me trying to brag-I'm just letting you know my background in this field. I also feel like I would like the environment of the teaching workplace (ik some of you are cringing at this), but I always wanted to be like my teachers who were friends with the staff and did silly stuff like pep rallys.

-Location: I moved across the country for med school. I hate it. I am a very big family person and being away from my friends and family is taking a big toll on me. If I go into teaching I am sure I can find some job in my homestate.

-Time: Medicine takes forever. 4 years med school and 3 years residency (could be anywhere in the country). I am unsure I can even match into a residency (its like applying to med school all over again but worse and you little control over where you end up). Im not even sure I can successfully pass my boards. Like I have said I have been struggling majorly this first year. It all feels very uncertain.

-Lifestyle: Medicine requires you to dedicate your life to it for at least 7 years. Sure I can work part time after those but I will have loans to pay off. If we are being honest my entire goal in life is to one day raise a family of my own and be with family. Im not chasing money and in my culture the girl doesnt have to contribute to household expenses. I actually grew up poor so 50k is a lot to me. Some of you may think this is silly but this is what I've always wanted.

Those are my reasons. Being in med school away from family has made me realize that I dont really care about being rich (nor will med school get me to that point anytime soon). My worry is that I fantasize teaching too much. Of course I know it has its own problems (what job doesnt), but I feel like I would be much happier working a 9-5, doing something I like, and being near family and friends. Lol I guess you can roast me in the comments now."

I'm teaching an English language course in which the materials were provided to me at the start of the semester. Sometimes I like that, sometimes it gives me good ideas, but these materials...well, they're pretty outdated. I'm the type of person who has a strong desire to make my own materials to feel like I'm contributing something new, being innovative, putting my own ""flair"" on things. I changed a few of the exercises and the head of the department has asked me to kindly use the materials provided to me and not change anything. And it really upsets me. On the one hand I understand where he's coming from that he wants the material to be consistent between instructors, but on the other hand I like to put in that extra effort, I love to make materials ""mine"" and infuse my personality into things. Have you been in a situation like this? I'm having a hard time letting go when I see so many things that I could potentially improve."

The high school 3 miles away closed this week due to a COVID outbreak. They’ve been open using the simultaneous teaching model, with students 6 feet apart, for a month. That district had multiple elementary schools closed last week for the same reason.

We got an email this morning that one of our elementary schools that opened to students 2 weeks ago is already closing temporarily due to an outbreak. 

My school is bringing back students who are in danger of failing 3-4 classes for the year May 3rd. They are bringing them back at midterm. If they’ve failed every term so far, they need a B to get their credit. If they are failing at midterm, they won’t be able to get a B. So why are we bringing them in?

We’ve had 6 positive cases with *just staff* in it my building for the last 3 weeks. 

We have a month left. Why are we putting students and staff in danger for a month of in-person-but-still-taught-like-virtual instruction? 

Close the school buildings in my county, keep everyone safe, we’ll fix it next year."

You not only get to redesign, reimplement, and retrain the staff, you also get to read about great research and brainstorm new ways to reach kids.
I probably spent an hour updating my resume, writing my letter of intent, until one of my coworkers said: ""they don't want us, we're not admin""
And sure enough, I read it again and I need an applicable admin license, which can only be gotten through Praxis AND a graduate program.

PM-ME-DOGS-PLEASE	2021-04-27 23:58:12+00:00	I don’t feel I’ve done anything to prepare kids for standardized tests.	"Please help to ease my anxiety about this. I teach 8th grade math. 

I reviewed some sample state test questions today right before leaving work and my stomach dropped. Last year was my first and our state tests were cancelled, so this is my first experience with them. I’ve been following the standards closely but upon looking at the sample questions they are way more complex than I anticipated. Several steps, multiple skills in one question, etc. Some standards also went more advanced than I realized. Some things we covered extensively that didn’t come up at all. I don’t understand: from what I’ve heard from their 9th grade teacher my kids last year were so prepared for 9th grade math, even remembered key formulas by heart. 

I can’t help but feel like I could have taught my kids better. I thought I was stretching them so much this semester and felt really proud but this has left me deflated and feeling like I’ve failed them. We switched to block scheduling so I’ve had them for half the year and for longer periods of class which, in my opinion, the extra 20 mins are useless because they don’t have the stamina to do math that long. Last semester we were mostly distance so we covered the bare minimum because so many kids did nothing at home. 

I know I could have been better, done review activities, pushed them harder, looked at practice questions sooner, used class time more but now it’s too late. Looking for ways to feel better about this from the community."
Klarinot	2021-04-27 23:05:06+00:00	Community building with middle schoolers?	"I got my first official teaching job as a long term sub at a middle school for the rest of the year. I’ve been here for just over a week and finding it hard to create a sense of community in some of my classes.
I tried to do card talks but a lot of my students didn’t really take it seriously or want to share. I “encouraged” some of them to but I could see how reluctant they were. I know it’s late in the year and that the 7th and 8th graders are basically checked out but I’d really like for it to go well and it just is feeling so overwhelming. For context the students’ original Spanish teacher had to leave halfway through and they’ve been given 2 other subs before me who didn’t speak much Spanish. I’m their first real teacher since January basically.
I’m also young so it was tough to become an authority figure to them, but I think I got that down, it’s just bonding them and getting some mutual respect. I was told to use my youth to my advantage but that wasn’t really helpful? I have no clue what to do so any ideas would be great."

emmocracy	2021-04-27 16:08:25+00:00	KWL except not	"Looking for a version of an interactive/collaborative KWL chart to use with fourth graders while we're reading a novel. 

The novel is about an Inuit boy who can't bring himself to kill a seal even though it's culturally important that he do so. My students aren't familiar with Inuit culture, but there are definitely parallels between the societal pressures the protagonist faces and those faced by my students (approx. 96% of students in my school are POC).

Anyway, for these reasons, I want to do a deep dive into Inuit culture before we start reading and find ways to make this otherwise dry (mandatory) text more engaging. 

My plan is to post a large version of the chart in the classroom and give each student a sticky note for each chapter we read or after each reading session. I want to students to have a say in what they write and to which chart they post their notes. I also want to give the system enough structure to make it useful as a kind of ongoing formative assessment.

I think I'll keep the wonder (W) and tell students to post questions they have after reading there. I'll probably keep the learn (L) and have them post new/notable info they learn there. I don't see the know (K) as being very useful throughout the whole novel, though. Thinking of changing that to a P for predictions, but that also kind of falls into questions. Although, I could see K as being useful in the beginning when I teach background info/context for the novel and it would function as a kind of anchor chart.

Should I just stick with KWL? Are there any other versions I should look into? Has anyone used this kind of system before? Help! 

Please and thank you."

I have been an in-home childcare provider for 7 years. I practice a respectful approach and collaborate with the parents (parents I CHOOSE to work with). I am currently pursing my MSTC. The last things I need to complete are: student teaching (I plan to intern), CSET, RICA, TPAs, US Constitution, renew first aid/CPR, and certificate of clearance. I just really don't want to be a teacher and completing this program just feels impossible. Being thrown in to politics, dealing with 25+ students and their parents, fulfilling all expectations of teaching, and learning what I can and can’t say/do in the classroom is just really unappealing to me. I feel helpless because what they require and expect from us is very irrational and a lot of it I believe is a money scheme. Just thinking about having to complete the CSET, RICA, and TPAs feels impossible (though I know it's not)! I haven't had to take a test of any sort for years and thinking of having to do it in a fucking pandemic just gives me anxiety. I'm thankful for all that I've learned and it's made me a better childcare provider, but for so long I've known I don't even want to be in the classroom. I wish I can find some sort of alternative because especially now (with the pandemic), I do not want to be in the classroom. When I picture being in the classroom, I can’t see anything but depression. This whole process is a lot of work to land myself somewhere I don't even want to be."

I spoke to my union rep and he said I didn’t have to create content for more courses than I could plan for during my planning period; however, it seems like my colleagues (including my AP and our paraprofessional) are disapproving of my attempt to either seek compensation for the extra planning time or shift responsibilities elsewhere. It’s not like I’ve been doing this forever so I don’t just have readymade worksheets to pull from - I have to find and develop curriculum for all courses.

I’ve been repeatedly kicked, punched, cussed at and swore at 3 times a week if not more since January. 

I’ve also been pulled into the office multiple times because I’m too stern with said student, and I need to take more of a proactive, positive approach.

What rights do I have? The student I’ve mentioned doesn’t even have paraprofessional access.

I am writing here because I have been accepted to study  at Tampere University and University of Jyväskylä, and I am indecisive about which one should I choose as my Master's degree.

Both are great universities to study but I am standing here confused and conflicted about which programme am I to accept. From Tampere University I was accepted for the European and Global Politics. From the Jyväskylä Uni I was accepted for the Development, Education and International Cooperation programme, and lastly, Languages, Intercultural Communication and Globalization.

My educational history is somewhat complex, I went to vocational school for a culinary course of three years, afterwards I took the national exams in order to be accepted into university, which came true. I have a B.A. in Translation of three years from the NOVA University of Lisbon and studied certain subjects within that programme which included the study of certain aspects of politics, economics and etc. As well as having collaborated for projects with international students.

I have always been deeply interested in the international environment and while politics is something I do not want to go for, diplomacy and migration are two things which fit me perfectly. 

I read the description of the three programmes. I want to focus in migration, diplomacy and international relations subjects. All these programmes have subtle similarities. Has anyone studied one of these programmes? If that is the case then could I get some advice? Which one offers the best quality of teaching?

""Next 4-5 years, the best education will reach all”, he said, fully confident.

I said in a low slightly under confident voice, “Sir, the intention behind this is awesome but, with all due respect, I see major issues which may disappoint all”.

But as expected, he seemed disinterested to listen. I happened to interact with him again a few months back, this time, I had more of his attention. It was great of the prof to listen to me, to disagree with me, to dwell further on it and then to come back after 20 odd days nodding in agreement.

There is another teacher that teaches the tail-end of my subject. I teach history to 1865 and they teach from 1865 to present. 

Recently, I’ve had students going to the other professor and submitting their essays to them for ‘advice’. The advice to this point has been somewhat innocent in my opinion: change the spelling of this and maybe consider citing that kinda advice.  However, yesterday I had a student that said the other professor said their work is good and should get an A and that I only have a master’s and they have a PhD. 

I feel that this is a dangerous road to go down because despite the fact that only two students have gone to the other professor thus far it is going to increase. I also think if I were to look at that paper now and give it anything less than an A that the student would feel empowered to challenge my grading. I asked my principal to meet over this and directly asked the other teacher to stop giving students advice on my assignments. 

Have any of you encountered this before and how did you handle it?  Did it get worse like I think it will?  What are your thoughts on other teachers agreeing to meet with your students to look at their work before it is due?  Am I making a bigger deal out of this than it is?"

It’s been something I really have been felt called to do and a opportunity fell into my lap a few months ago. I tutor a 2nd grader by helping him with reading and writing work books and recently his hw. But while I’m definitely learning on teaching him material, that’s not my main concern. He is a very angry kid, he often insults people (me a lot lol), he’s hit a girl before (nothing crazy but still zero toleration with that) ,yells and has cursed at kids (mainly girls) on my street, and just gets furious thinking about things (sometimes says some violent things. I think he acts out because his parents are divorced. Mine are as well and when he talks about how it affects him or stories I tell him how I relate to it and how it’s normal. I just have trouble reaching him sometimes, deep talks and advice aren’t kids thing and that’s how I deal with things. If y’all take time to look at my situation I would greatly appreciate it and leave suggestions down below. Take care y’all!"

I do enjoy teaching and I don't think I'm terrible at it, but I've realized I don't really want to be struggling just to make ends meet for the rest of my life. I'm considering pursuing a master's of social work.

So first off, has anyone gone from teaching to social work that could give me some insight as to if this is a career I might enjoy?

Also, I feel like I've based so much of my identity for such a long time on me being a music teacher, and I would feel like a failure if I change careers. I logically know that's not true, but it's something I'm struggling with right now."

Lorriie	2021-04-22 23:36:10+00:00	Covid elementary recess ideas?	"Has anybody got any games a group of students can play at recess? Due to covid we can’t play with playground equipment (balls and jump ropes etc) but we do have access to a big toy. 

The class is about 10 students between K/1st and 4th/5th grade, special needs but socially they are playing at about a 2nd grade level collectively. The playground does not have a large open area to run around in. 

One of the biggest issues is making sure the game is “fair” for everyone (obviously the older students give allowances for the younger ones, but they are hard on each other and haven’t had much peer interaction in a year, so conflicts escalate very quickly over minor issues. We’ve had to ban tag because it was getting too rough and they kept saying people were “cheating” (?) for example

Because of the huge age gap anything competitive is rough to do because obviously the 1st graders can’t keep up

We played “four corners” today which is basically all the kids run to the four corners of the playground (that an adult numbered) and the person who is “it” closes their eyes and counts to ten then calls out a number 1-4 and anyone in that corner is “out”, until there’s only one left. Which went okay, but I don’t think there’s much longevity in it, 

so I’m basically looking for contact-free easy to explain games, does anyone have any ideas? Or what are your kids playing in covid recess? Because we are sped we are at school all day

thank you!"

annerevenant	2021-04-22 22:27:55+00:00	"With 7 Mondays left, I have lost complete control of one class"	"Just what the titles says, we have 7 weeks left and one of my classes is completely out of control. They all range from 10-12th grade but they won’t stop talking, they stay off task, I assign them classwork to complete so we can do a debate/simulation and none of them do it. I constantly have to speak over them to get their attention and today was the absolute worst it’s ever been. I’m a first year teacher and this is a semester long course, in my other classes the relationship building aspect has always been my go-to for classroom management and it’s worked but not this one. 

I’ll admit I’m a pretty laid back teacher, I let students listen to music while working, if a student slips a cuss word I let it slide, I don’t deny bathroom breaks, I let them work together on assignments and (so far) this has all led to students really respecting the classroom and abiding by the rules. However, it’s clear that this class has decided that the small amount of freedom I give means there are no repercussions. That combined with COVID burnout and the general sense that they all think this year doesn’t count has put me at the point to where I need to decide to come down on them or if I just need to survive."

If you resigned from a Private Christian School for political reasons, what were they? What changed about your perspective from start to finish (why did you take the job in the first place)?

I'd also love to hear from anyone who might still be at a conservative private school, classical Christian school, Catholic school etc. If your politics don't align, and you are seeing nastiness each day, why are you still there? 

I went through this experience in the last year. For me (as well as roughly *seven* other teachers in the last five years) it's been a combination of the anti-LGBTQ+ bigotry, racial ignorance, authoritarian dogma, and a generally cliquish environment."

The author argues that instead of calling what many teachers go through, “burnout,” that “demoralization” better describes it.

Do you agree that it is a better word for it?  Do you think some go through burnout while others are demoralized?  Does the term make a difference in possibly turning around the implications about teachers and our struggles in education today?"

Questions will include preferred methods of teaching and teaching styles, views on integration vs inclusion.

Throw3030150	2021-04-22 03:18:12+00:00	Is creating resources for virtual and classroom learning worth it?	"I have tried to ask this before but never got around to it and if I don't ask I'll never get it out of my head. I believe it's a good idea to create Open Access textbooks for the Pre-k to 12 grades using the curriculum that that school is following. Schools used to pay hefty sums to buy textbooks and some still do! This information can be provided the same way at a lower cost in print and online for free. To me nothing beats the textbook working in tandem with the teacher, whether online, in a classroom or a prerecorded lesson.

Just asking for your opinion on the subject."

Now I am moving to a private school where the school is modeled after a U.S. classroom. I will be a teacher for a class of 30 Taiwanese/American/Canadian students and they follow a U.S. curriculum. I have only taught in a pre-k daycare program and ESL, so this is very different for me. (Also, my masters was in ESL education)

A little backstory: I'm a sub applying for positions. I did a long term sub job back in the fall, and it was virtual so I wasn't used to it. I didn't get in major trouble, but the principal talked to me about some concerns she had. I took her advice and I improved. I went to a district building asking about my application and someone in HR looked over it and suggested I ask the principal at the school where I did the long term to be a reference because it looks good. However, I'm on the fence about this. I don't feel like she would want to be a reference for me, because even though I improved, I also feel like I disappointed her. Thoughts?"

Milos-Obilic	2021-04-21 18:16:38+00:00	How to answer question about the politics of teaching social studies (interview)	"I've been on two interviews and they've both asked me about how I would keep things from getting out of control if modern politics gets brought up in a class and I'm not sure if my answer is the correct one, so I'm curious if my answer is fine and how others would answer the question.

I've basically answered by saying that I would stick to the curriculum and write objectives on the board, so if students bring up modern politics in a lesson I can say ""this isn't what we're studying right now."" And if the subject it related to modern politics (in a history course), by creating projects that involve primary sources about the subject in question so I'm not saying anything political, but they are reading from people who were living through events what they were thinking about them. 

Good answer? Bad answer? Okay answer? How would you answer?"

I am teaching a couple of intervention courses at the middle school level, with curriculum focused on developing executive functioning skills. I have small classes, and I love it! The program is relatively new, and a subject change for me.

I am in the process of setting up a token economy for my classroom, where students can earn points (or something) and then spend them on a reward. I have a pretty significant budget already and a supportive admin, with kid-friendly rewards purchased or requested. 

However... my background in teaching has never focused much on rewards. I have had positive relationships with students, but always felt that tangible rewards were gimmicky. What suggestions do you have for me in setting up this new system? I'm too far in to back out now and am suddenly feeling unsure.

* How often should students be rewarded for the system to be effective? I have big and small rewards available (e.g., everything from a small piece of candy to art supplies, books, and game time).
* How can I manage this system without feeling overwhelmed?

But I was so nervous to teach this topic because it’s always something that a lot of kids find taboo, or just plain funny.

My students were surprised when I was ok with them laughing at the words “penis, vagina, scrotum, etc”. They weren’t disrespectful about it. I was so proud of them.

I was so happy when the girls in my class felt comfortable with asking questions about the menstrual cycle and what to do if something goes wrong.

I was impressed when someone made the analogy of testes is to sperm ducts as ovaries are to oviducts.

Honestly, it just went so well. I’m so excited that my students enjoyed the topic (even with the awkwardness).

mikumochan	2021-04-20 16:36:29+00:00	Struggling with teaching because of anxiety + question about STEM -&gt; English.	"I got my certification last December through a university program alongside my bachelor's in biology and I certified in general science 7-12. I haven't started a full-on teaching job yet- I'm trying to get practice tutoring/subbing because I'm TERRIFIED of how my first year is going to go. 

Namely, I have anxiety and it comes out a lot with teaching. I constantly overexplain things, or I can't explain things well because I'll be in the middle of saying something and realize that I forgot to mention xyz, and then I'll immediately backtrack and it gets confusing. Or, I'll get distracted by student responses and respond to them in the middle of what I was saying and forget my train of thought. I don't want to be talking for an entire class period or anything, but if I even try to fix a misconception I just stumble over myself trying to explain it in a way, then re-explain it in a slightly different way, etc and it feels like the students just get more confused. Being unable to explain things well makes me super anxious and then it's hard to focus. **Did anyone else start out this way? If so, how did you get over it (or did you decided to do something else as a career)?**   

And then there's the question of subject. I'm a fan of science and I have a whole degree in it but I wanted to be an english teacher if only because I love talking about characters and writing and story analysis, but my advisors encouraged me to stay in STEM. What I want out of teaching is to encourage kids on a daily basis to develop good socioemotional habits (like being nice to themselves, etc.) and find things they care about earlier rather than later. After student teaching science, it really doesn't seem like there's much room for even all the science material that should be included, much less non-content material. So now, I'm stuck between ""Science is really hard and a LOT of work @ making labs and I feel like I'm overall more passionate about English"" and ""I did all this training for Science that I won't get for English, I don't even read a lot, and I'll have to study/pay for English certification. It might also just suck?"". 

**Does anyone have any advice for emotional material in STEM?** **Has anyone swapped from STEM to lib arts? If so, what was your experience like + how would you compare the two, content preparation and overall difficulty-wise?**"

I am 35 weeks pregnant with our first child. I have been teaching math at the same high school for 6 years and loving it. Right when I was pregnant, I told the school and the district office that they need to find a sub for me. I will be missing 3 weeks and final exams. I told them I would follow contract and create 2 weeks of planning and then the long term sub can do the rest... well that is not the case... I was informed today that I need to plan everything for the rest of the year because the sub doesn't know how to do math... I teach Algebra 1 and 2 and am very frustrated that they couldn't get someone with ANY math skills.

My building principal told me today that I need to create notes, worksheets, quizzes, and the finals before I have my baby... WHICH COULD BE ANYDAY NOW! AND he told me I need to record a video of me teaching all of the notes so the students don't fall behind and so the sub doesn't have to.

My sub reached out to me and reminded me how he doesn't understand math and that ""technology is hard for this old fella"" BUT HE HAS TO GRADE THE FINAL, SUBMIT FINAL GRADES, AND SUBMIT FINAL EXAM GRADES ON OUR ONLINE GRADEBOOK. I just see this going horribly.

I have talked to my union rep and she said that COVID made it impossible to find subs so there isn't much I can do. She said I could just follow contract and do 2 weeks of planning, and that I wouldn't get in trouble... I am already stressed enough with having this baby and now I have to do SO much more work for my maternity sub plans. Trying to not let it get to me but MAN I am frustrated!"

beyonddead	2021-04-20 03:28:50+00:00	Teaching is like Art	" \[Part of my assignment\]

Teaching is almost like art, every artist starts with the same paint on their palettes, but every artist makes something unique to themselves to essentially communicate something. Imagine you’re a painter, and a museum asks you to bring in a painting to display in their gallery.

Art involves the artist, the art piece and the observer. In fact, the observer is an integral part of 

art. If their subjective experience resonates with the piece of art, the artist may have succeeded.

So what will you choose?

Your painting must be worth looking at. It must be compelling. It must also evoke something in the observer to invest their time and attention in your piece. Well, there is already an audience at the gallery, whether they want to be there or not, they’re already there. What can you do to make your art stand out?

One option might be bringing in your wine-night painting that was essentially the same painting as the other 30 people in the room who bought the same Groupon deal as you. Sure, the painting *looks* nice, it may even have one or two unique variations to the other 30 people around you— but more or less— it’s the same. Maybe it’s a night sky, with a bright moon and a blossoming cherry tree. As beautiful as it is, it’s a copy in one way or another. And people will just say that it’s nice, and you may have been proud of that piece, but the observer’s investment is little to none.

Your other option is to provide an art piece that is unique and meaningful to you. Something you’d want to share with others, maybe there’s an important message to be said, maybe there’s something worth *looking at*. You could veer away from the ensemble of art that screams genericism and work on a piece that offers something to your audience. The more time, effort and patience spent on your piece, the more compelling your piece becomes. It is layered, and offers observers to connect to your piece on different levels.

In a retrospect, we can all conjure incredibly unique artwork in our minds, but to translate these images in our minds requires a level of transposition that separates good artists from great artists. Like artists, teachers may hold a wealth of knowledge, but the skill of teaching requires the ability to articulate our knowledge into comprehensible steps in our lesson plans."

hope everyone is doing well! I'm new around here but am looking into gaining a teacher's certification. 

currently, i'm looking into the ABCTE program + an online MEd pathway with the secondary certification and student teaching component—this is the only option that exists in my home state, which is one of the few that recognizes the American Board alternative certification. i'm interested in the ABCTE for its 1) cost (the UC programs are a bit too pricey for me) 2) efficiency, but I have also been researching the calstateteach program as a former CA resident. so, my questions to anyone who has participated in calstateteach or the (online) cal state credential system or has thoughts on ABCTE:

1) is the program significantly more expensive for those paying out-of-state tuition than the 11k number or so for in-state residents? for me, the total cost (including ABCTE fees) would be about that for the alternative route certification, so if the difference in credit cost only amounts to a few thousand, I'm wondering if the ABCTE pathway is as cost effective as it initially seemed.

2) would it be the case that a CA state license is more flexible than an ABCTE + MEd if I wanted to perhaps convert that teaching license to teach n a state that does not recognize the ABCTE (e.g. MA)?

thank you so much for any guidance you might be able to provide!"

From now until the end of the school year on June 9, I am a long-term sub in a smaller district. Given the current state of the world, the district I'm subbing in cannot guarantee me a permanent position once the school year ends.

Looking ahead, I've applied to other places and had my first interview today. They offered me the job, and I told them I needed some time to think.

What's the timeline for hiring? I told the district that I'd let them know by the end of June, and they seemed taken aback. If I interviewed today, am working as a long-term sub until June 9, and have more interviews these next few months, is the end of June too much time? Also, what's a fair starting salary in Michigan for someone like me?

I would appreciate any feedback and/or advice about my particular question, and the interview/hiring process in general."

"We have been told all year ""such and such decision will be binding"" when talking about parents deciding virtual vs in person for their children, but our principal even admits that this is a blatant lie. Lastt week we got a bunch of kids who made ""binding"" decisions to stay home for the rest of the year  they're not failing any classes (the ones I got at least) and have no documented reason to come in other than "" we changed our minds"". We've just been told that even next year decisions won't be binding (again virtual vs in person, our county has a ready made online school program normally for sick/special circumstance children) and I'm so fucking over it. Either it's binding or it's not. Stop bending over to let parents fuck us because they couldn't be bothered to make the right decision for them in the first place.

I am dreadfully worried about my students. I am concerned I am failing them. Their writing and content knowledge is not where it needs to be. I took over mid-year, COVID going on, my school makes them take this class in 9th grade...all sorts of things creating a challenge. It's not a perfect situation. I am trying my best, the kids are generally great, and I enjoy my school/team. (They're all such supportive people)

That being said, my district started almost a month late due to COVID. We take our AICE exam in early May. After that, I have about 2 months of time until Summer. Does anyone have any suggestions for lessons, assignments, or portfolios to engage in after the AICE exam? All ideas welcome, thank you for reading my post."

I have a student, she's a great kid, and I'd like to buy her a book before the end of the year. This student is graduating from 7th grade, has an interest in tap dancing and is enrolled in Kickstart, which she seems to enjoy. She isn't terribly excited about reading because she has both dyslexia and dysgraphia. As an ELAR teacher, I feel it is important to encourage her, however. Unfortunately, I'm just not terribly familiar with what types of books would be appropriate for her - when she reads, she reads at around a 7th grade level, but the disabilities make reading slow at the best of times. I've spoken with the school's dyslexia teacher, but she's proven... less than helpful, let's say.

Can anyone offer any advice? Please and thank you."

However, i also hear horror stories about teaching, people working 100 hour workweeks, dealing with a system that they feel is broken, emotional exhaustion from caring for children etc. Etc. 

I like kids, and work well with them but my question to teachers of reddit, would I be doing a disservice to myself and my students pursuing this career just for some stability and a work year that might allow me to write without starving? Can teaching be a job that has a healthy work/life balance? Has anyone decided to get into teaching for similar reasons? If so how did it work out for you? Thanks :)"

"This seems like such a huge necessity now that we have to interact online with the students, that it surprises me I've been searching forever without finding anything useful.

Every site and tool I have around provides the uploaded homework files, then I have to download them, open them and look at them one by one. This is such a huge headache, especially for big classes. I want to be able to see all the sent homeworks scrolling through one page, without downloading anything. Also, it must not show the pictures uploaded by each student to any other student, I should be the only one who can view all the answers.

Not only for homework, this would be such a great help for exercises during class as well, where I want to see and give points to what the students have written, without having to download files in the middle of class and without having them see each other's answers.

This to me seems not only a very common usecase but also pretty straightforward to implement, so I'm confused why I can't find anything of the sort. Maybe I'm just searching the wrong keywords. If you know of sites with this kind of functionality it'd be hugely appreciated."
gauchelygraceful	2021-04-17 03:27:26+00:00	Going into Teach for America this summer and having mixed feelings about it	"Hey all, I'm a recent college grad who is joining Teach for America's South Dakota corps this summer. Part of me is excited because I love kids, I love teaching them about the world, and I love seeing them get enthusiastic about learning something new. I feel strongly that education is one of the most powerful resources for kids, so when I was accepted to TFA, it felt like a dream come true. 

That being said, I'm feeling apprehensive about this coming year for quite a few reasons. The first is that, despite the good it stands for, TFA has a lot of issues, two of them being that a) they don't give their teachers enough training, and b) the turnover rate it encourages tends to be more harmful than beneficial to students and often displaces veteran teachers in the area.  I'm now anxious about what my experience with TFA will be like and about whether or not I will do more harm than good through my involvement with the organization. I'm also starting to worry that I'll find out that I'm not cut out to be a teacher and that I'll have no idea what to do with my life anymore. The past two or so years have been highly education career-focused (I'm currently working on my certification and getting an M.A. in English, and have worked a few part-time jobs in education), so I would be devastated if I found out that teaching wasn't for me.

Any advice?"
inevitable_ants	2021-04-17 00:33:47+00:00	Tutoring advice	"Hello,

At the start of this school year, I was contacted by a parent at my local youth club in regards to tutoring for her son. I began tutoring her son every day of the week except for Saturdays. At first I enjoyed my work, but then the mother began expecting me to do more than just tutor (such as organize the house) and I was afraid to say no so I agreed. I later worked up the courage to ask for a raise because I believe I am underpaid as it is anyways and I was taking on more responsibilities than I was hired for. She quickly knocked me down and said that she refused to give me a raise. I want to quit working, but feel that it would be ethically wrong for me to leave the son so shortly before his end of the year exams (a little over 6 weeks left). Every night I come home and dread having to tutor. What should I do? I am afraid to make the family mad by quitting. 

Thanks in advance"

"I'm hoping to get my master's in special education but my program doesn't prepare you for the elementary education exam (and I need that teaching certificate). I would have to prepare for the test with no background in education. 

My question is, would it be reasonable to study for myself everything on the test, or should I go for something like Teachers of Tomorrow (supplemented with subbing experience) to prepare me for the certification exam and then do my master's in special ed at a later date?"
tamaleringwald	2021-04-16 01:15:56+00:00	"I've been non-renewed at 2 schools in 2 years. Neither were my fault, but does it still look bad on an application?"	"I got my credential (after 10 yrs of subbing, after-school programs, and arts ed) in 2019. I recieved an MSC with Theatre Arts Authorization, and a school hired me to teach drama full-time plus help them implement a new arts magnet program for the 2019-2020 school year.

Well, you know what happened next. So the entire arts program got scrapped in June 2020, and my contract was not renewed-- thoughI got several glowing references and letters of recommendation from colleagues there.

Luckily, right away I got another drama position. When I was hired everyone thought in-person school was starting in the fall-- we didn't know until after I signed my contract that we'd be staying in distance learning indefinitely (we're FINALLY coming back in 2 weeks). Teaching drama to 500 kids over Zoom every week has been a mess, but I've done the best I could.

Except now, again because of COVID, I'm losing my job at the end of the year. Fall enrollment dropped significantly-- which meant less classroom teachers, which meant less prep periods, which meant they didn't need as many specials teachers to cover the prep periods... and the thing about drama is that even among specials, we're on the bottom rung. A school will always eliminate drama before they'll eliminate music or art.

The last few weeks I've been applying like crazy (I live in the SF Bay Area), to both regular classroom teaching (which I'm fully qualified to do) and theatre teaching positions, in grades K-8. If you count all the individual public schools, private schools, charter schools, and district pools I've applied to so far, it's easily over 100 jobs. Yet I've only gotten 2 interview offers, and both are for schools that are hard-to-staff and pay terribly.

Is there room for understanding when HR sees 2 non-renewals in 2 years on a applicant's resume, or does it automatically go into the trash bin? Do the extenuating COVID-related factors in both cases make a difference, or the fact that both schools have nothing but good things to say about me?

I'm worried that I have a strike against me for things I had absolutely no control over. Am I panicking over nothing?"

"I  have a class I got thrown into (and this is just the best example I can  think of) I only have them one class period per week, and we use a 6th  grade (they are in 8th grade) science book that is public domain. It was  last minute so the students (it's a private school) printed their own  books. This semester about a third of the students didn't have their  books. I'm pretty sure they thought it would be a one semester course  and threw away their books, but they, 7 weeks into the semester, keep  saying they left them at home. So when I ask to see the questions they  were supposed to answer in class and a student says their book is at  home, I ask why. Why did you take your book home if you I 100% of our  work in this class is in class? Rather than: ""What made you think this  class was just one term?""

Not seeing it as a big deal, I tried to console her, letting her know it would be alright.

My daughter faced ridicule and was made fun of for the rest of the day. 😡😠😡😠So much for OCPS creating a warm and welcoming environment. The principal deserves to be suspended the same way she likes to suspend students for offenses less sever than this. 1st, she got caught not wearing a mask while fixing lunch for students in September, then 12 of her teachers have left since the school year started, and now this?

BonesyWhufc	2021-04-08 10:30:11+00:00	Going for a “Practical Interview” where I’m delivering a lesson for the first time.	"Hey guys, I’m 18M and have been going through a recruitment process to become a sports teacher for younger students aged 5-11.

I have my first time delivering a lesson today and I don’t have faith that my lesson planning will be enough.

I’ve coached younger students before when I was in my final years of school, but that was without the pressure of not getting a job if I made a couple of mistakes along with the fact that I was still a student so I had a bit more leeway with how I could act with the students (able to use slang to be relatable, knew some of them personally so could make jokes towards them but the situation is a bit different as I’m not a student) 

To put it simply, because this is a one off lesson and I won’t have 6 weeks to develop these student’s abilities, could I get away with having a vague overall objective but make the activities as fun as possible so the recruiter sees that the students are having fun around me? Or will I need to be strictly educational.

Any tips for first lesson nerves will help!"

neonpoison	2021-04-07 02:59:52+00:00	Denied by Cal Poly Pomona - It felt like a bad April Fool's joke but it wasn't. Was this a simple mistake and/or an intentional betrayal?	"TL/DR: I felt betrayed by Cal Poly because all three of their people I've talked to - The Admissions Advisor, the Credential Analyst, and the Academic Advisor - all failed to provide accurate information to me during the application process. They made me belief that there was a very low chance for denial (based on my background and experience). ""The rejection cases we see usually involve applicants totally screwing up their essays or something."" - This was the kind of answers I got after specifically asking each of them about my application. 

I know that admissions aren't guaranteed. (doh) But did they intentionally create the illusion of a near-guarantee and mislead me in my case? Did they fail to communicate internally about how many more applicants they received and caused this mess? (If this is true, there should be more people sharing similar stories as mine). No matter what the real reason is behind their lies and misinformation, I am sharing this here so people hopefully avoid suffering the same frustration. Here's the long version:

I have been teaching in international and private high schools for over 11 years. Having personally helped thousands of students with their Common Apps, I was well aware of our college admissions system. (Or so I thought). I thought Credential programs like this are different in a good way. My reasoning was this: since California has a shortage of teachers, they should have made it easier to get into Credential programs. Again, this assumption was confirmed multiple times and throughout all the conversations I've had with the three individuals mentioned above. 

During the mandatory Zoom interview with the Academic Advisor, he even said something along the lines of: ""The rejection cases we see usually involves applicants totally screwing up their essays or something. So you should be fine.""

I was certainly convinced that I was getting in, I followed all the procedures, I did everything they asked, I communicated timely and frequently. I can't emphasize this enough: I asked for feedback for my application chances throughout the process and was repeatedly advised to not worry."

tarathetarantula	2021-04-06 15:32:05+00:00	Should I apply for this job?	"I moved to a rural area with the lowest paying school district in the state. They are constantly in financial distress. I am certified as a school librarian. They have a very difficult time finding and retaining teachers because their pay is so low, and housing here is incredibly difficult to attain. Many vacation rentals, no longterm residential rentals, hard to purchase a house because out of staters swoop them up with cash in hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, I applied for two jobs, both which I was offered. The first one ended up being less hours than they first told me, so I could not accept the position. It wasn't enough pay. Second one was basically a social worker. Because they couldn't find a social worker for the position, they hired me as an emergency hire, at a very low step. They told me I could keep the job if I also jumped through a bunch of hoops in two years - basically getting a second masters degree that I could not get time-wise (too many courses to fulfill). I decided to take the job, even though I realized it would only be one year at a low pay and also well below my experience/step. It was meaningful work, even if just for a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I showed up to my first day of training (I only had two before school started) and they did not train me on a thing. Instead, they refused that I ask questions but also told me I would be the art teacher and health teacher, in addition to the primary mandatory reporter of child abuse and homelessness at three schools. I would also be responsible for implementing a behavior policy that was not in writing, and nobody would tell me what it was. When I asked, the head teacher responded ""like anyone knows"". It isn't a bad school - they are just so underfunded. Only 1/3 of the students at their elementary school graduate the school. Their parents move bc pay is so low here, and they can't make it out here. One last thing -  a teacher was trying to come to this particular elementary school to be our art teacher, from a different school in the district. She was awarded the transfer, but then her other school would be short an art teacher - so they threatened to make her pay back all of her health insurance premiums if she switched schools, in the same district. That was terrifying to me. No teacher can do that, especially in this area. Long story short, I quit after that one day, before my OWN health insurance started and I would be held legally liable to repay it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't have a housing problem bc my boyfriend has stable work here. I have ten years of experience as a librarian. A librarian job opened up in this district. Even though I quit that social worker job, I know they will hire me. The school is five minutes down the road. But I hate the way this district is run. Question is - should I apply, or too many red flags? Thanks for any opinions."

2sticky2b4gotten	2021-04-04 02:31:54+00:00	Would you recommend dual certification (in SPED or ESL) for someone who isn't 100% passionate about either?	"I'm going to grad school for Elementary Ed, and the school I'm going to has a dual degree program where I could add on a Moderate Disabilities license, but it's a lot more expensive. It would be 8 more credits (so $8,000 more), and it would be an unpaid practicum rather than the paid full year elementary internship. 

First of all, my main interest in teaching is in reading and maybe writing. I would like to teach either 1st or 2nd ideally, and when I think about teaching I mainly just think of teaching reading lol (obviously the other subjects too, but I feel like if I do have a ""passion"" for anything it would be literacy). 

I imagine I COULD do that in some capacity with a Moderate Disabilities credential in a resource room. But I have honestly never thought about teaching special ed before I applied to this school, and I don't know if I could deal with the infamous paperwork and IEP meetings and apparently the constant threat of possibly being sued (!?), without the ""passion"" for special ed itself. 

Basically, I think it might be interesting, but to be honest I'm thinking about it more because I'll be in Massachusetts which is allegedly one of the hardest states to find a job, and everyone is saying you NEED a dual cert to get hired anywhere and it's kind of freaking me out.

Somewhat the same story for possibly trying to get certified in ESL. I think it could be interesting since I am interested in languages and learning languages etc. but again, it's not my PASSION. So I don't know if it would be worth the extra expense of the coursework and testing.

Has anyone else thought about this? It might be nice to have another option besides gen ed classroom teaching, but yeah the costs are kind of astronomical. Anyone in Massachusetts who has thoughts about the expense vs hiring rate dilemma of adding extra certs would be appreciated as well :)"

darkanon_	2021-04-01 12:32:18+00:00	"I want to research combining gamification, expression and immersive storytelling in a school curriculum."	"*This is an excerpt from a letter to my college professor in the technology education major.*

I know I am supposed to be working on a video production curriculum plan for my senior design project, but I think I have stumbled onto something much more compelling. If possible, I want to research gamification of curriculum in the classroom. When I first attending the ITEEA conference in Atlanta, Georgia, I attended a session (I am not sure what they’re actually called) about gamifying your classroom. The teacher (who I believe was actually from somewhere in Connecticut) used a program called Rezzly in her classroom. Essentially, the different assignments which students could complete in her classroom awarded them with experience points. As they earned experience points, they could level up. The students in her classroom could also tackle these classroom missions for experience points in any order they wanted. In my eyes, this made learning into a video game. Just like in World of Warcraft, I could choose to explore the content and quests in my own unique way. As an avid video gamer, I was also fascinated by the concept of leveling up a character by completing things in class. I wished that my technology education teachers did something similar while I was in high school. While I was writing up this email, I actually went over to the Rezzly website just to refamiliarize myself with how it worked. Apparently, the learning service officially shut down on August 31, 2020. To my knowledge, there is no other quest-based learning system like Rezzly available. I have been working very hard on my educational ideas over the past few months, but I think I want to invent something much better.

Ever since I went to this conference, I have been toying with this idea of turning my classroom into a video game using Rezzly. I thought that the classroom structure described in this session was very similar to something I would create myself. The only problem with Rezzly in my eyes though is the lack of a story. When I try to use Rezzly in my classroom, do I just give them the missions at the beginning of the semester? As a master procrastinator myself, I assume many kids will look at these assignments for experience points one thing. They will most definitely goof off on their smartphones and play games on the computer at the beginning of the semester and struggle to get the work done before the end of the semester due to their procrastination. I have seen that many kids struggle to stay on task throughout my many observation hours. I noticed when computers are present (as they typically are in a technology education classrooms) the likelihood that the student gets off task is exponentially higher. Shiny screens and access to the Internet just have this kind of effect on students these days. I started thinking about Rezzly, and I want to make something similar but different in that it keeps kids invested in learning.

The first area of technology education I would like to test this on is woodshop. I remember writing a very comprehensive curriculum plan for Materials Processing, but let’s just throw typical curriculums out the window for a second because what I am trying to do is honestly much different. In my comic book universe, I have a superhero named Ink Girl (based on my best friend, Stephanie) who also happens to be a woodshop prodigy. One of her many superpowers allows her to build things super quickly. If I was going to use this character in my classroom, I would begin my showing the students a five-minute short introductory video which tells the story of Ink Girl. I am just going to make this up as I go, but let’s try to make a proof of concept. Our main character, Aurora Willoughby is using her magical tattoo superpowers to chase down an evil magical sorcerer named Dreslaran. Dreslaran is an amazing villain character from a secret society where magic is taught to kids beginning in kindergarten. When he was just fourteen, he chose to use evil magic and break away from the secret society he grew up in because they wanted to keep magic a secret. Just like a much bigger villain named Daniel Darkblade, Dreslaran is looking for the key to immortality in Artemis’ mystical golden armor told about in legends passed by travelers over time. Ink Girl attempts to stop this villain with her powers in an epic battle sequence which gets the kids excited in the same way as Marvel movies. The kids hold onto their seats Ink Girl takes cover for a moment. She breaks the fourth wall and she speaks to the audience instructing them to build her a catapult to use in her fight against Dreslaran. She continues to say the more of the story will be unveiled after the students launch their projectiles at Dreslaran together. After two weeks of working in groups and building wooden catapults in the workshop, the students use their contraptions. The class ends with the next video in this story. The catapult hits Dreslaran directly as he disappears into a black portal. Ink Girl tries to figure out what has happened to Dreslaran. As she feared he had escaped her grasp once again. Ink Girl walks back to her apartment. The room is covered with posters from punk rock bands like Panic! At The Disco, Green Day and Fall Out Boy. She sits down at her computer and looks for unusual criminal activity to stop with her powers. She listens to the police radio hoping to find an opportunity to save someone. She finds a strange article about a large ball of blue light seen in the park last Friday night. She prints out the information while looking at more videos taken of the unexplainable blue glow in the park. She investigates further and finds other strange sightings throughout the town documented online. She prints them all out and then looks to the audience and speaks again. She explains that she needs a snazzy wooden desk organizer to sort all the information she is finding on these strange occurrences. The next two weeks of the class would involve building desk organizers for Ink Girl before revealing a video containing more of the mystery. I want to make learning fun by getting students invested into this elaborate and exciting storyline. I don’t think that every teacher would want to use this, but I certainly think could be a different approach to teaching to try if you class doesn’t care about anything you assign. This might be a way to get younger kids excited about woodshop class. They would be building things for Ink Girl to use throughout her adventure. As students complete different parts of the building process, they can gain experience points. As they gain more experience points, they can buy things to customize their superhero avatars. You can view the superhero avatars in your class while you are logged into this online learning platform. I would like the students to be able to buy things to customize their characters that are based on pop culture. If a student really likes watching Riverdale, they can put on Jughead Jones’ Southside Serpents leather jacket. If they are really into movies, they might wear Dorothy’s shoes from The Wizard of Oz. I want to make the character customization a reward for kids and a way to express themselves. Many kids don’t have the money to buy nice looking clothing. The cool thing about digitally customizing these characters is that nothing will cost money. You can choose to express yourself in anyway you want, simply by playing your part in the story and working through the creations that Ink Girl needs.

I am not sure if I explained that well, but that is the idea I have floating around in my head. I want to make learning opportunities where students are immersed into a story. Most students see technology education as an elective and usually don’t take it as seriously as classes like math and English. I want to make these superhero stories so epic that kids can’t help but get excited to learn in class.

One of the questions I asked myself when writing this email is what about the other days? Sure, kids will probably be invested into the story during the short film and that day but they probably will forget about it over the course of the two weeks which they are working on the current project. I want to come up with little bits of future story that can be revealed on each day of class. An example of this might be telling the kids that Ink Girl will uncover a conspiracy in her town involving large blue balls of light and other unexplainable things. Another example could be Dreslaran teleporting back to Ink Girl’s location and erasing one of Ink Girl’s magical tattoos with a mystical artifact. The bits of story on each day will be a reward for the students working hard in class. Before the story piece for the day is revealed, each student will have to fill out an exit slip explaining one thing that they learned during that class.

I want to explore this stuff as the next stage to gamification in not just technology education, but education in general. Educational superhero stories like this can be used with any topic. I could do a similar thing with video editing and my superhero counterpart, Professor Duality. The possibilities are endless and I have some really out-of-the-box ideas to go along with these thoughts.

I want to make learning fun again, but I also want to create really cool characters who can inspire kids. Maybe one kid likes Ink Girl so much that he gets really into woodshop and even buys their own Sawstop for their work at home. Maybe one kid likes Professor Duality so much that they download Adobe After Effects CS6 to make cool visual effects like he does on his computer in the stories."
EnvironmentalGal77	2021-04-01 02:25:32+00:00	Is it possible to be a substitute teacher while working a FT job??	"I work FT as a park ranger (Friday’s off), but I’ve had many other jobs in my past centered around education. It’s something I really enjoy and feel passionate about. Lately, I’ve been feeling interested in becoming a teacher. I’m nervous about quitting my job and jumping headfirst in teaching without a lot of experience working in a classroom before. 

I’m considering trying out the field through substitute teaching while working my current full time job. I have Fridays off, so I thought I could potentially just have my availability open on Friday’s. Would this be feasible? If not, what are other ways I can test out working in a classroom without giving up my full time position??"

"I just got hired as a ""teacher"" (aka childcare worker that manages kids classes all day) at a preschool/daycare in my area. I've done similar work since covid started (hosted at a summer camp). But the difference i immediately noticed was that all the teachers are angry *ssholes to the kids. They seem annoyed, and at times angry with the children (kindergarteners) over stupid simple things, that often times they couldn't help or weren't their fault. I never acted this way at my previous job, and neither were my coworkers. They like to yell at the children, and well, treat them like children. I hate how they talk to and about the kids. Its annoying. Am I slightly worried im going to be stressed enough by my job that I end up becoming this way too?.. All of the kids kept reiterating that I was ""the nicest teacher ever"" but I did JUST arrive, so of course they like me haha. I know theres a rumor that elementary school teachers and nurses are ""mean girls"" grown up (and funnily enough im replacing a staff member whose going off to study nursing) but it just seems like a stupid way to raise/teach kids.. I don't like to show anger to them, any suggestions to help teach children a lesson without raising my voice or showing anger? I'm pretty soft-spoken anyways.."

gg1384743	2021-03-31 19:33:29+00:00	Temporary Teaching cert for just one year? Florida	"To make a long story short: Im going to graduate undergrad with a degree in biology in December and then I plan on going to PA school (PA is sort of like a doctor). But in between I will have a little over a year where nothing I do counts towards my application for PA school. I've always been interested in teaching and I discovered the temporary teaching certificate route in Florida that allows you to teach without teaching degree and I thought it would be a unique opportunity to explore something outside my field that interests me (also if I taught bio it might help keep me sharp for grad school). But I have some questions I am hoping you might be able to answer:

1. What exactly do I need to apply for the temporary cert I saw one thing that says I need to take a tests but other things that say I can just meet the degree requirements? What about to get the biology specialization? 
2. From what I understand, the temporary cert is designed so you can be part time completing normal teacher degree and is 3 years. Obviously, I don't really want the normal teaching degree but to get the temporary cert do I have to be enrolled in a program for getting a normal teaching degree? Also does it matter I only want to teach for one year, like will I get in trouble for quitting after 1 year?
3. From my understanding, you must get a teaching job to be granted the temporary teaching cert. How do I go about applying for jobs if I have no teaching cert ? Do I just say I expect to get one upon employment ? Does just having a temporary certificate disqualify me from getting normal teacher salary?
4. Is there any benefit to getting a biology specialization or not? (Easier to get cert, easier to get job, salary, etc...)
5. Is there any benefit to applying to teach certain grades? (Easier to get cert, easier to get job, salary, etc...)
6. Any general advice, guidance, resources ?

Any information you have would be so appreciated :)"

I've seen a lot of listings where the only qualifications I really need are a degree and a state teaching license since, supposedly, high school physics teachers are in high demand right now. The thing is, I don't want to remain in the state I currently live in, nor do I have much of a preference for what state I would like to live in. But all of these job listings are in different states and each state has a different certification. My problem is that I can't just pick a state and go get the certification in that state because what if I do and there are no jobs there once I'm certified. 

**So I was hoping someone on here might know if there are any ways to look for places that are willing to hire me *before* I'm certified to teach**, so that I can then go out and get the certification in that state without worrying about whether or not I'll be able to find a job in that state.

adult_in_training_	2021-03-31 15:59:33+00:00	Didn't realize how exhausted I was until spring break...	"I am a first year teacher teaching 7th grade science. I am miserable. I am exhausted, I am burnt out.

We were hybrid most of the year and went back to full time last week. This week is spring break. On Friday I went to bed at 10pm... woke up at 7:30 pm on Saturday. I was still exhausted even after that. Everyday I have been sleeping 10 hours with naps in between. I never realized how exhausted I was. This felt different from a depression phase (I have bipolar amd GAD so depressive phases are normal for me). I WANTED to enjoy spring break playing games,reading,watching anime. But I physically could not stay up due to exhaustion.

I teach 7th grade science. Kids don't do their work during hybrid and during in person they complain constantly. I hate my content. I was originally a Bio major, I added a teaching major my junior year because I realized how much I loved teaching when I volunteered at a high school. I LOVE teaching highschool. I woke up excited every day. I love biology soooooo much. But because of COVID, I ended up taking the first job I could get when I heard they were postponing interviews indefinitely. And that job was as a 7th grade science teacher.

This age group is not for me (though I do cherish my kids!) and I honestly couldn't care less about heat transfer and moon phases (although they are important! Just not for me!) I miss photosynthesis and meiosis/mitosis. I miss everything about it. I'm looking for a HS bio job but they are scarce rn.

Long story short,I am exhausted,lack motivation, hate what I teach and can't handle this age group. My professors said I was born to be a teacher,my cooperating teachers wrote racing reviews, I loved everything about teaching, but I'm burning out..."

WeeJabbyCunt	2021-03-31 15:39:45+00:00	School wants me to create reading program??	"So up until this year, my school has implemented a structured, reading support class with pre-provided curriculum. It wasn’t the best, but it definitely wasn’t the worst, and the curriculum was created by literacy specialists. I could implement it and supplement with my own stuff, etc. 

Now they want to stop doing it, but they still want to have reading support classes. I am in no way trained or qualified to offer literacy support, and the thought of creating a curriculum to support students who are several grade levels behind in addition to the other classes I teach sounds impossible. It’s an academic intervention, shouldn’t someone trained in literacy development be doing this? 

Am I within my rights to turn this down, or should I just go for it? Is it ridiculous to demand that the job be done by someone with the certifications to do it? I just feel like literacy development and English (one of the subjects I also teach) are VERY different things. I feel really out of my depth."
KevTravels	2021-03-31 11:34:12+00:00	What's been the best approach for seeking a teaching position?	"So, I have my certification program beginning in precisely 2 months and was informed weeks ago to start looking for a job at a school. I've gone to individual school websites, checked the schoolboard website and even emailed/called several myself. I'm not entirely certain if that's been the right approach but I've been doing it. 

I see that of course some (online) list what they're hiring for but I figured also a good thing to at least familiarize myself with a particular school or district so they remember my name/resume even months from now in case something might work in my favor. 

Just curious the approaches others have used to help secure a teaching job? Were you able to have one secured prior to the start of your teaching license? Did you have to wait up until late summer for a guaranteed job?"

Overheard a conversation about schools just starting to going back 5 days a week and then taking ""Spring Break."" Sadly, the conversation was not supportive - basically it was ""What do the kids need a break for? They just went back to school!?""

I'm a HS science teacher, I'm so exhausted. I'm so disillusioned. I've been working around the clock, practically nonstop for more than a year now - and no mental breaks since last Christmas. And I need a break. Any break. I wish people had any clue what it's like to teach hybrid school.

Tl/dr: Some people still think the breaks in school schedules are for the kids."
chuuluu	2021-03-30 18:32:31+00:00	The satisfaction of saying “no.”	"Am currently on medical leave (so no access to anything school related except the texting app I use to communicate with students). A student athlete (high school) who during the school year consistently texted me after 11pm about turning things in late so they could be eligible for grade check the following morning (and not in a polite way—they would escalate to all-caps texts if I didn’t answer them at midnight) texted me Sunday night saying, “You know how we (i.e. this kid) sometimes (always) turn in work right before the term ends? Well I don’t know the sub’s number or email so who do I contact to turn all my late assignments in tonight?” 

In my school we’re not allowed to reject late work—if it’s from that grading period we have to accept it up to our deadline and many teachers even accept work after and end up doing grade change forms. This is encouraged to the point it’s expected. We’re also not allowed to fail above a certain percentage—if you do, you’ll end up on a growth plan. This of course results in all the students thinking of deadlines as negotiable, test scores being lower because so many kids ignore work until the deadline then attempt to do a term’s worth in one night, thereby retaining nothing, and I fear for how they’ll fare in the real world. 

So it was very satisfying to reply that I told them before I went on leave that the sub doesn’t get paid to grade after hours, and that they would have to respect  whatever deadline the sub gave them. In short, “no.”"
Starbourne8	2021-03-30 16:12:04+00:00	I’m sad to be leaving	"I’ve only been teaching for two years, but I’ve made the decision to leave. I will finish out this school year, but I’m going to be day trading crypto currencies instead. Honestly, it makes me sad. All I’ve ever wanted was to teach students. I thought it would be fun and rewarding. Instead, I’m an abused baby sitter.

Last year, I had students that were very diverse. A students, B students, C students, D students, and students that failed. But last year made me want to quit. Maybe it’s the title 1 school situation, but man, these kids have been crazy. So many discipline problems. I can’t even teach.

Then Covid hits and in sorry to say, but it was a dream come true in a way. No more discipline problems. I was making fun videos for the students. I could set up fun projects for the kids to film. But there were students that were not doing any of the work. (Remote learning). I was told to help the kids from failing. Keep my assignments open, etc...

Now I have more A students than ever before and more F students than ever, and nobody in between.

And now, the kids are back in class, and I can’t teach anymore. And I’m done. It’s not a healthy profession to be in. It takes a physical, mental, and even spiritual toll. And I’m blamed for all the Failing students. I don’t want to be here if I can’t teach. I just want these students to shit the F up sometimes. 

So after 4 years of college, and just two years at this, I’m outta here. 

I’ve been researching day trading and I guess I’ll give it a go. 

Just sad that I am leaving a profession where I’m helping people for basically a casino....."

StrongSadIsMyHero	2021-03-29 11:26:36+00:00	Is in person teaching working anywhere?	"Our state out of the blue two weeks ago told us that we were moving from 100% remote leaning, to 100% in person next week. The ventilation systems in most of our schools are still broken, and many classrooms, including mine, don't have windows to open. We're told to just keep the kids as far apart as possible, knowing that there are classes where it will be impossible to keep kids 6 feet apart. With only 8 weeks in the semester, it seems like we're going to barely get any of the logistics on this to work before the semester will be over, and what little time I had left to actually try to teach anything will be gone.

I got in an argument with a friend about all of this because he thinks it's great they're finally opening schools and thinks that research and studies point to the fact that they should have been open for a long time. The truth of the matter is that I don't think he cares that much about the education part, but really misses his daily baby sitter. One of the reasons I pointed out to him that I didn't think returning was a good idea was all of the stories I read here on reddit. I hear stories of staff, and even students that have died from this disease. Cases spiking in schools and it getting somewhat brushed under the rug. While I know that the are many studies that show that younger children don't spread the virus as readily as adults, the number is still not zero.

Anyway, he had to point out, maybe rightly, that taking people's personal experiences off of here is anecdotal and creates a bias. But I've not a heard a single teacher say that in-person learning has been anything less than a huge dumpster fire, anywhere, ever. I have been surprised to hear that this seems to even be the case in countries outside of the U.S. So I thought I would throw out there the question: Has in-person been successful for anybody? Have you found this working well, cases haven't spread, students are doing better in the classroom, ect, and you just haven't posted the success story?"

I have a five-year-old student whose mother recently asked me if I know of any reading games since her son is beginning to get bored of https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com (a good resource, btw!) and isn’t focusing when he plays it. I don’t have much communication with other tutors, and the program I work through doesn’t provide suggested resources and usually focuses on developing math skills.

Does anyone here know of any games I could tell her about? Most of the ones I’ve managed to find are either a) just playing videos for the kids or b) brief one-time activities rather than a continuous game with a profile.

Our government takes pride in saying (and reminding it everyday) that we're one of the only European countries that hasn't closed its schools at all since September. Cases are growing like never before. Every country around us, Germany, the UK, Italy has closed their schools for the last couple months. But in France, nooooo, never, what a silly idea. We're reminded everyday that the virus is not transmitted at school! We've had countless different protocols. To this day, and it's been a few months, we have to open the windows in the classroom for the first 15 minutes of class, and this regardless of the temperature. When a kid is tested positive, we're not considerate as a 'contact case' because we wear masks (needless to say one third of the students wear their mask under their nose) and we're not even told sometimes because of the 'medical secret'. And last night, our great minister of education shared a song on YouTube, sang by American parents that are sick on online learning. This is disrespectful as heck. I'm tired of it all.

However, here we are nearing the end and I'm a finalist for Teacher of the Year and could very well win.  I'm flattered, but feel I'm not really the most deserving.  While I did a sufficient job, I feel like those who know me well know how hard this year was for me.   Technically, if I win and accept teacher of the year, I'm supposed to be coming back next year, but I haven't made up my mind yet.  Part of me will have a tough time leaving the profession to be a SAHM again but part of me knows that I want my family life back and that a different position or subbing can be rewarding and more balanced.   My question is, do I approach admin and let them know I'm not certain at all I'm coming back and that if I win, please, give it to someone else or do I just see what happens, accept the title if I win and then make a decision by the end of the school year.   I feel that if I accept it and the don't come back, I took away the joy and glory another deserving teacher could have but I also don't want to be guilted into staying.  Or maybe I should stay.  Maybe there is good in me, I don't see."

lincolninlawrence	2021-03-28 19:08:11+00:00	Has anyone ever gotten their student teaching/practicum assignment in a city they’ve never lived in because they wanted to move?	"I was accepted into a Masters program that will have me with a full teaching license and another masters degree in a year which is great. But, it came at an awkward time for me as my mom, my only surviving parent, recently died and I had to do a lot of family things over the last year during Covid.

Long story short, I would like to move to Denver or the north Denver area or Minneapolis but while I know each a little bit, I have no idea about the schools. Had I stayed home where I’ve been subbing, they would’ve assigned me to my favorite school which I hate to leave but I also don’t wanna live in the town I’m in anymore.

Am I running the risk of getting thrown in a crappy school, which I suppose is likely a necessary learning experience at some point? I guess I’m just hesitant to say I’ll be in this XYZ area so look for an assignment for me and then have absolutely no idea about anything related to that area.

Sorry, I tried to search but it did not work out. Thanks in advance."

In that time, I have posted 60 videos and have been growing slowly but steadily (240 subscribers and 16K views as of now).

I am well aware that there are hundreds of more polished resources/videos on the topics I have covered online, whether it be from Khan Academy, 3B1B, etc. But with that being said, I have always really enjoyed teaching, and so I wanted to give running a math YouTube channel a shot. I would really appreciate your feedback on how I can improve my videos (specifics discussed below) and also your general thoughts on the content I have created so far.

Around 3 months ago, I decided to start an Algebra 2 course I'm planning to go through the entire curriculum, but since I am still in school, and I am only to post one video a week. Before this, my channel was primarily oriented around solving fun geometry problems and doing proofs of commonly used math formulas. In addition, I made videos on concepts from Pre-Calculus every now and then."

Working only a part time minimum wage job, I would have gotten good financial aid but no, instead I have to wait 2 more years, I've already been out of school 1, until im 24 and I can use my tax info. My step dad, the info I have to use, makes good money and none of it goes to me so the financial aid package they calculated was next to nothing. My plan was to be a substitute to save but covid threw that out the window it was a struggle just to get a minimum wage part time retail job here. I just hope I missed something, some program or loophole, or whatever that you all did to be able to afford the tuition of your credential programs and life costs during the time in the program.

So I start student teaching next semester and I am extremely frustrated with my school and with colleges all across the country. I had a meeting with the person that matches us with our host teachers and schools. I am beyond frustrated!! I think in this day in age, especially with the pandemic financially stressing everyone, it is absolutely insane to think that student teachers should pay full tuition, let alone tell them that they cannot have a job. It is absurd to think that these students should basically be doing a paid internship, students paying for the internship, though. The audacity they have to tell students that they should not be working, not everyone is financially stable or should feel obligated to take out more loans for student teaching. A regular internship in the business or political science department at my school would literally be paid, and it is a part of the program that they have a semester of paid interning. It is just frustrating how other students benefit from these paid internships while education students are thrown into the trash basically. Does anyone else have a similar experience? I have friends that go through different educational programs and they all are not allowed to have a job and are not paid through this ""teaching internship"" (it is sometimes called this in different states). I was just wondering if this was all over the US or just in my state because frankly, this is ridiculous."

Hi everyone, first time posting here. I'm currently a junior in special education, with a focus on english and mathematics. I know teaching is what I want to do, but I've been struggling so much with mental health, with everything being online for school, and all that stuff. I know how stressful being a teacher is, and I honestly don't know if I'm currently cut out for student teaching next year. I'm considering dropping out of school and becoming a paraprofessional while focusing on my mental health. I don't know if anyone has any experience with this, but is it realistic to go back to school in a few years to get my teaching licensure after I have my mental health under control? I also want opinions on if anyone actually thinks this is a good idea. Thanks for any advice anyone has to give"

I knew I didn't want to become a teacher. I just finished my study just to have the the degree. I would assume it was better than quiting after all the work I put in. I'm honestly a bit done with studying for a another bachelor or a master. However I have no issues with doing small courses on my own like on udemy to learn new skills. Not sure if recruiters give any weight too large udemy courses?

I wonder as a teacher in Finance &amp; Control and Economics if it would be possible at all to land on a job like finance administration. I mean I got a ton of knowledge during my study about finance &amp; Control however someone who would have a degree in Finance &amp; Control obviously has more knowledge and for sure more practial experience in a business.

My best bet would be applying for a lot of jobs and hopefully the competition isn't big and they need someone on the job ASAP. I think. 

Maybe the hardest part will be to get the first job in finance. What if I land on a job and let's say work 3 years in it. Would it be easy from there to grow up in other financial jobs? Or will this education degree forever hunt me when pursuing a career in finance when trying to find a new job?

I struggled through poor management in first 2-3 years and my last 2 I got highest ratings and felt confident, sure I was making a positive impact and prioritizing student voice and engagement. I reflected and reflected and adapted and reflected more. I worked overtime to create hands on project-based learning experiences because I couldn’t motivate myself to do it any other way. This year I’ve been home through the pandemic but was supposed to be going up in levels to try something new since I finished my masters. Now I have a couple offers and two schools are actively trying to convince me to return/transfer, yet right now I feel like I’m not the teacher or person either school thinks I am. 

I’m struggling with my mental health and a resurgence of ptsd symptoms and am honestly yearning for a job I can leave at work so I can work on my mental health, balance more and focus on my kid (who has adhd and needs more of my time, guidance and help). BUT I have no idea what else I would do. I don’t feel capable of anything else. This is all I know, my entire schooling, experience: everything.

So I’m preparing for a phone interview (Middle School Math &amp; Science) and I’ve been trying to prepare as best I can.

The district I’m interviewing with is my *dream* district and I want to be as prepared as possible.

I know this district uses the “Ventures for Excellence” screening test, and I’ve searched high and low on the internet regarding this program and cannot find anything (minus a few dissertations a and research papers about the effect of screeners).

It used to be called the “Teacher Perceiver” test. 

I have gathered that it’s a 22 or 30 question screener, that asks questions for a specific teacher behavior. I assume they will be like:

“A student walks into class crying because their pet just died, what do you do?” 
“A parents wants to meet with you because they blame their child’s misbehavior on your teaching, what do you say?”.

If you have any insight on what kind of questions I may be asked, or if you have experience w/ this screener, please let me know!"
oheyitsmoe	2021-03-15 18:16:25+00:00	Student does nothing. Admin doesn't care. Not sure how to proceed.	"As title says. This student barely participates in class. I teach on Zoom to several elementary students. My school offers full time distance learning as well as in-person learning. I manage the distance learning program.

This child does zero homework, parents don't respond to emails or phone calls, and I can barely get him to participate in class. He is two grade levels below the one he is currently in, in both LA and Math. He is failing because no work gets turned in and he does not meet any grade-level standards.

Throughout the year I've documented every email chain, every (limited) conversation with parents, their inability to get anything turned in, to meet with me, and to do the bare minimum for their child's education. For each student we have ""roadmaps"" where we document anything that needs documenting, good or bad. Most students' roadmaps are 1-3 pages long. His is 18 pages.

Admin tells me to document it all, but they won't hold the child back, and there's ""nothing they can do"". I am still terrified that at the end of the year, the parents are going to try to pull one over on me, and screw me somehow. They are hardcore victim mentality people and blame everyone but themselves on their child's failures. Am I doing all I can to protect myself?"

This post is gonna ruffle some feathers, but I don’t care. I think it needs to be had. We need to talk about equity in education. But I have a question. Why is it so hard for so many teachers to discuss race in the classroom. I know teachers that avoid Black History Month, but are completely okay teaching Casimir Pulaski. I’ve seen teacher tape off desks in classrooms for “problem students” BEFORE the school year starts, and YES this child was Black. I’ve seen Black kids be locked out of classrooms and I’ve seen teacher have celebrations when Black families leave the school. These are all true things I’ve seen with my own eyes, and I’ve only been teaching 3 years. 

But these are the same environments that claim that as an educational system, we don’t need trainings about cultural proficiency or culturally proficient curriculum. It’s actually combative. Why is that? Because as a Black teacher, it frustrates me to see kids being treated the exact same way I was treated by teachers that tell you there’s no problem. Someone help me understand.

therealcourtjester	2021-03-14 14:59:51+00:00	Ethics while teaching during a pandemic	"I recently read this white paper and found it articulated things I was experiencing but couldn’t put a name to.  For example the author says that based on the stated priorities of schools, “we value schools as providers of care before and even above their roles as deliverers of learning opportunities.”   I have felt this, even before the Covid shutdown in situations such as our state requiring all students to have lunch at school, even on shortened days.  This meant our class period became 30 minute periods (and lunch waves started at 9:30 am) in order to get every thing in plus a lunch wave on short days.

What I really found valuable about reading this was the identification of the policy that all students are educated during a pandemic or no students are educated.  The author defines the idea of leveling down and concludes “Even if there were somewhat equitable leveling down within the district (although middle-class families within the district would likely still find ways to educate their children), between-district inequities would be further and likely irremediably exacerbated.”  This has been my observation and instinct as well.

I am interested in other perspectives here of professionals out in the trenches.  Have there been shifts in your district to level down?  Is it working?

*In very small classes, we read very good books and pressed the students to think deeply about the words on the page. A lesson plan was not a list of points for the teacher to make; it was a set of questions. Even better: a single question. I always joked that the perfect lesson plan would have been to wait until the students had assembled in the classroom, throw in a copy of The Iliad, and go to lunch. By senior year, it might have actually worked. By then, they knew what we were teaching them to do. “The seventh grader says Macbeth is weird,” my department chair told me once. “The 12th grader says Macbeth is ambitious.” Once students could make discernments like that, it was time for college.*

Granted the example is from a teacher that taught in this environment 25 years ago, but it made me wonder...do private schools put emphasis on stuff like ""I Can"" statements, learning intentions, posted standards, etc.? Or is that pure public school minutia?"

I started applying for fall positions last week, and got a call the next day for a position that’s currently open for immediate start. It’s my preferred grade(s) and subject (7th/8th math), and would be a perfect jump start to get reacquainted with the classroom before starting a full year in the fall. I want this spot so badly, but I’m so nervous. I’m not very impressive on paper, being that I’ve been away from teaching longer than I was actively employed. I think I’m possibly the only interview for this position, but I don’t want to bank on that and I really want to wow them.

In the interview, I have 10 minutes to introduce and present a lesson, and then explain the follow up activities from that lesson. My chosen standard is “use the Pythagorean theorem and its converse to solve problems”. It’s Texas standard 8.7(C) for anyone familiar with the TEKS. Anyway, I’m really struggling trying to narrow down how to approach this. There are so many unknowns and I could really use some help. I know this school is really big on preassessment, differentiated/personalized instruction, and all those other buzz words. 

Here are my ideas so far:
-Preassess by going over the PT equation, squares/square roots, and watch a short animated video depicting PT. 
-Lesson- discuss how we might use the Pythagorean theorem to find an unknown length, or how to determine if a triangle is a right triangle based on lengths of sides? Doodle notes on the document camera where I model practice problems (I would also offer pre-typed notes for students who prefer/need them). We would do a handful of problems together, possibly where they write answers on a white board and hold them up to show me so I can kind of assess as we go. 
-Practice-  individual or partner practice on worksheets, or complete a foldable as a group, or complete like a jeopardy game in teams, or do like an escape room activity in groups (I prefer homogenous groups for the activities, heterogenous groups for foldables/group notes)
-Assessment- exit ticket on their way out so I can see who’s getting it
-Take it further- project where they come up with real-world application, build or draw a model, write a word problem, and solve. 

I understand that Covid protocols would change these in practice, but it didn’t say to take Covid into account. 

Thoughts? Changes? I desperately want to get this position. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I’ve done my own research before applying for MS positions, but I’d rather hear from personal experience:

- What are some of your favorite moments teaching middle schoolers? What are the best parts of the job? 
- I’ve heard MS can be tough because the kids are still so young and full of energy; how has this changed (or remained the same) in a remote environment? 
- I hope it’s worth it! I think I’ll like teaching younger students, but it is a BIG change for me. Any comforting stories you have teaching middle school, lay ‘em on me!!

"I will soon be applying for teaching positions in CA and am trying to figure out what the pay scales mean on the teacher salary charts. I am in a masters+cred program that will end with me having a masters that took 45 semester units (67.5 quarter units). 

I am considering starting a 2nd concurrent masters program at WGU (Western Governor's University) that would give me 30 semester units for a total of 75 Graduate level completed semester units. This would move me from the pay scale commonly listed as ""*BA+45 or masters*"" into the ""*BA+60 incl masters*"" and the ""*BA + 75 and Masters*"" pay scales, correct? 

I've also noticed some districts offer stipends for a 2nd MA. The return on investment financially is certainly there, and I have the time, energy, and aptitude to do both of these programs now. Is there any reason not to do this?"

Domak04	2021-03-11 18:53:24+00:00	Should I be concerned about one of my students?	"I’m not sure if I should be concerned about one of my students. 

So today I asked one of my students a question. 

He didn’t know the answer and I noticed he started getting a little agitated. I tried giving him a couple of hints but he just didn’t know. He started getting really distressed. He put his head down and started shaking his hands a little repeating the phrase “I’m sorry I don’t know” again and again. I asked someone else pretty much immediately after that.

I’m not sure if this is cause for concern.

For background info:
He is 16, he’s male. He is quite intelligent, doing fine in my class. 
1. I have taught him since September and this is the first time anything like this had happened. 
2. He seems to hate being the centre of attention for good reasons or bad reasons. 
3. He appears nervous and shy when it comes to talking either to me, or in-front of the class. 
4. He’s very very quiet in class, never chats with anyone else. He walks in, does his work, walks out. 
5. When I ask him a question in class, he always sounds very very nervous, he seems to be low on self confidence because he always seems surprised when he gets a question right. 
6. He also never volunteers an answer to a question, even if I ask him and it turns out he knows, he doesn’t ever put his hand up. 
7. He seems to be a very literal person. I once asked him to go up and write something on the board. He did, but his writing was fairly small. I jokingly said to him “do you think you could write EVEN smaller?” sarcastically. But he then wrote the next thing even smaller. When I told him I was being sarcastic, he turned bright red and started wringing his hands a lot, very flustered. 
8. I’m not sure if he has many friends, I never see his talking to anyone while walking in or out. 
9. I have noticed that when he does talk to someone, he doesn’t ever make eye contact with them. He looks at the floor, the table, his hands, never the face of the person he’s talking to. And he seems to be quite awkward. 
10. He seems a little childish. I’ll quite often notice him chewing on his fingernails, or softly on the collar of his jacket. And sometimes I’ll see him rocking slightly. Neither of these things are super pronounced but I do notice them. And he also sometimes sits a little oddly on his seat, for example he sometimes sits with his feet up on his chair hugging his knees. 
11. However, he’s very very sweet and kind. Before a test once, the kid sitting across the table from him was really nervous and he went over to him and said “it’ll be fine. You’ll do great. Ok?” And then after the test, he gave the kid a big double thumbs up at the end! Which was really sweet because he was super nervous too! 

Do you think I should be concerned about him? If yes, what do you think could be the problem with him? Could he have some sort of mental disorder? Or am I just worrying too much?"

-Experience as a PreK lead teacher 
-Experience as a substitute in public schools


I’m feeling a little conflicted about what I should do next...

I’m planning to move states next January so I didn’t think it’d be wise to go for a teaching position in an elementary school because I didn’t want to mislead a school and leave mid year. I’m about to graduate with certs in elementary and special education in the state I’m moving to. In between semesters/ student teaching I’ve been substituting at elementary &amp; middle schools. In the summer I have a steady job at a school age summer program. (I also have a side gig for this spring working with adult students virtually some evenings) 


My dilemma is if I should keep doing this part time at each job(~32 hpw at both jobs) or look for something full time as a full fledged teacher in PreK. I’m not too worried about the ages because my favorite experience has been with Kinders and younger students. 

It would be 40 hours per week at the same pay as my summer job &amp; higher than substituting but it would add about 10 minutes to my commute everyday(25 minutes). I don’t love the hours of the new school but my hours are also unpredictable in the summer so it could not matter much in the end. 

Any thoughts or advice as I’m starting out? Any insight is super appreciated!!"

Originally out of high school I wanted to be a teacher. But the schools where I lived were very expensive so I just continued with my dog grooming career. In 2018 I decided to go back to school for speech language pathology and fast forward to today in 2021 and I didn't get into any grad schools(had great stats but they're sooooo competitive).  The university that I went to for my undergrad degree offers a masters of teaching &amp; the initial teaching license. I have a strong desire to work with children and if I did do this I would be leaning towards special education because of the smaller classroom sizes. And I do like writing smart goals and IEP's etc. 
Obviously I'd love to continue with my speech and language path but another deterrent is the cost of graduate school as well. I'm going to have to take student loans for my graduate degree ( I have zero debt currently). The masters of teaching degree is about $15,000 which I would be able to pay for out-of-pocket. Whereas the speech language pathology degree is anywhere from 45,000 to 70,000. And as most of you know graduate degrees accrue interest daily as soon as you take them out. 

As a sidenote, I just turned 30 and I do want to have kids at some point but at this point feel like I'm spinning my wheels. If I continue with SLP I have to wait all the way until next fall to start graduate school(assuming I get in 😑). Whereas if I do the teaching program I could start this fall and be done by next fall.

SOS, help."
FloridaEngTeacher	2021-03-10 03:48:29+00:00	You’re always replaceable	"You’re always replaceable and don’t forget it

Hi guys! Long time lurker, first time poster. I actually made an account just to post this. 

For some background info: I’m a 3rd year high school teacher in Florida. I’m currently on a Temporary certificate because I don’t have a degree in education. 

In order to upgrade to a professional certificate, the state is requiring me to go back to college and take about a years worth of education classes. Long story short, I don’t have the money. 

So I decided to pursue a lifelong goal of joining the military. 

I got a date to ship off in late December, so I told admin in January that I wouldn’t be returning after spring break. This was 9 weeks notice. My principal asked me not to inform my students because I teach a state tested class and he didn’t want them to “check out” earlier than they should. Fair enough. 

On Friday, I get called to talk to admin in my planning period. They hit me with the “your replacement starts on Monday.” I was already supposed to be out of my classroom that day for a committee meeting. I said “I can’t even tell them goodbye or explain what’s happening?” I learned that I’d be moving into another teachers vacancy until I leave. Two of the three preps are classes that I’ve never taught before and I’m also not certified for. 

So they gave me a sub Monday and then made me TRAIN MY REPLACEMENT IN MY CLASSES on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

I’m devastated. I knew I’d have to leave eventually but I didn’t know it would happen so soon. I had spent four hours just two days prior to the notice working on a unit plan to make sure I taught every standard before I left. 

For the record, on paper this is someone else’s replacement. We have a lot of vacancies currently. Why they put him in my room so early is beyond me. I feel like I’m just being punished honestly. 

When my replacement shows up on Tuesday he says, “WOW! This room is so much bigger than my old one!” Indicating that this was now going to be his room. I shot a quick email to admin who confirmed that yes, I’d be moving classrooms to the other side of the building. They did not provide me keys until 2pm the next day. I was supposed to be “saying goodbye” to my students, teaching, passing the torch, and packing up my classroom all in two days. 

I emailed my principal on Tuesday and informed him that I’d like to cancel my formal evaluation that he insisted on scheduling. He responded “I can accommodate that. I’d like to have it done by spring break!” And told me to come see him for a “winning solution.” 

I ignored him. He approached my later and I put my foot down and told him I wasn’t having a formal with students that I only knew for two weeks.

It just hurts to feel so invested just to be treated like complete shit in the 9th inning. 

Thanks for listening"

Well, this week is going okay. It's science week so the lessons are planned for us so it's been a nice return to schools after being at home for so long. 

Anyway. Long story short. Doing a discussion topic today with a class to try and draw them back in and one of my students who's usually needs to be regularly checked on to see if he understands the tasks etc (possible SEN) did really, really well and this was with me having to work from the staff room with hoovering and chatting happening around me and he did it and his work was really good. He didn't post it in the right place but he did it and that's the main thing. 

I was so pleased because I've been suffering with BAAD imposter syndrome recently. 

I'm super pleased because I feel like I've finally found my jam with it, if that makes sense. 

And it's weird having to re-learn how to talk to other human beings. 

So thanks for your help, Reddit. 

Ps. The mentoring has gotten a lot better since being in school and I'd imagine it's finally been flagged that I needed more support as well so they're looking after me a bit more now :)."
Tidbits1192	2021-03-09 22:25:52+00:00	My Kids Don’t Like My Class	"Kinda of a mix of a vent post and a help post. This is my second year teaching, and the second batch of kids I’ve had that dislike reading. I teach 4th grade. 

Anyways, I’ll be the first to admit that my class isn’t very fun. I wish we could do Kahoots and more fun stuff like that but the problem is that when I try to do something fun like that, my kids can’t get back into “student” mode. They just go wild and can’t settle back down. Part of that is because I’m a marshmallow when it comes to classroom management, but I’ve tried positive reinforcement with different rewards but they rarely bite on it. I don’t want to have to scream at them but for some of them, giving them detentions is the only way that makes behaviors turn around.

Their math teacher is much tougher on them to the point where I’ve heard the kids say that they’re scared of him, but they absolutely adore his class because they get to do flash card competitions. His punishments are much harsher than mine, and he contacts parents far more often than I do, and he’s made a few of them cry on occasion. But he fist bumps the kids every day when they walk into class. 

Today, they wrote a ton of stuff on my board telling him how he’s great and they love his class and everything. At first I thought it was because he was mad at them and they were trying to make up for it or whatever. Anyway, one of my girls ended up saying how I must be bitter seeing all of that stuff on the board and it kinda hurt. 

What am I doing wrong here? It’s just frustrating to me because I want to have kids actually like reading enough to try for me while also not having to become a shrew just to get some of them to behave."

I recently volunteered to teach English to a group of students from a particular Eastern European country for free. I advertised that it will be a group of 4 students. Everything will take place over Zoom. I am planning on having a free-flowing discussion with each student one-on-one so I can assess their level of English before the actual classes begin. They have to be able to at least hold a simple conversation in English. I can also speak their language on a basic level, but I want the class to be mostly, if not fully, in English. My question for you fellow teachers is what sort of activities should I plan for these students to partake in? I am thinking of having the class being mostly discussion based, but I would also like to give them little assignments like essay prompts that they can also peer review with a partner. 
I have never taught a single class before in my life besides being a teacher’s assistant for a few classes in University, so I’m a bit lost. I am not even an English major in college, so I am not quite sure what would be the best way to conduct this English class."

Last year before remote learning, I had one of the math teachers (there’s two in my school) as my co. We had some communication issues but we worked well together. Now because of programming- I got switched to the other math teacher. 

My new co-teacher is much older. He has been in the system for over 13 years I think (along time). He constant talks at me but doesn’t do anything (and I mean anything at all). I’m the SPED teacher and he teaches math. Naturally I’m talented in math so I don’t need much direction with the material. However, I feel like I’m doing his job and mine. I plan all the lessons, I wrote the curriculums for his classes, I do everything. Grade, make the assignments, etc. everything we are both suppose to do. Anyway, I’ve tried so many strategies with him with making a template and having him fill it out, making google common folders, making videos with by step directions on how to use certain platforms, and even having conversations with him and admin. 

I’m burnt out. I feel bad that he recently had Covid. He was out for a month. Before he was out, he told me he was caught up on grading. In that month, I come to find out he didn’t grade anything at all. Grades were due so I had to do all this grades from the beginning of the YEAR! I’m burnt out. I’m tired. I’m happy I’m working from home so I can turn him off but all he does is bark orders at me all day and do absolutely NOTHING. The thought of working with him in the building next year fills me with dread. I’m so unhappy. Can he please just retire? I miss I was with the other math teacher so bad. My mental health is really suffering."

"I think it’s just something I have to learn with time but one of my biggest weaknesses is understanding where my students are confused when they can’t articulate what they are struggling with. Or I just don’t address their questions correctly because I misinterpret what they’re saying? 

Like the other day I tried to explain to my student that she plugged in the wrong value for a variable that she identified above the work, but she just wasn’t getting it. It was as simple as “you plugged in the wrong value for c” but then my teacher (I’m just a student teacher) said “you have the wrong y-int, the y-int is c.” 

Am I dumb?? I don’t understand how she didn’t understand my explanation but understood my teacher’s which seemed like a more complex thing to grasp. I hate that I can’t understand what they need help with sometimes."
SpicyGingerCake	2021-03-09 11:47:31+00:00	Doing the PGCE was the worst mistake I ever made.	"I'm burnt out. I'm exhausted. I start working at 8 and stop working to sleep at 1 in the morning. It seems like nothing I ever make for these classes is good enough, no lesson delivery is good enough. In order to take a day off for exhaustion, I need to wake up even earlier to tell them so. I feel like such a failure. It just never ends, I don't have any time that isn't devoted to work anymore. I haven't had time to cook a real meal in months. But there's only three months left of this goddam qualification that I've spent thousands on, so I can't quit, but I'm scared I'm going to make myself miserable until June and still fail the course. I like teaching. I like working with the pupils, but each PowerPoint I make takes hours because there's always something wrong with it. I'm so done. I'm always on the verge of crying. I hate this."
AffectionateCap4118	2021-03-09 02:42:06+00:00	Feel like a bad tutor	"I have been tutoring privately on the side for a family with a 10-year old for about 3 months now, and I feel like I haven’t been helping him improve at all. The marks he brings back are still below average. I know that depending on the child, they learn at different paces, but I feel bad that what I’m doing doesn’t seem to be helping and that the turn-out has disappointed the mom. I’m always super attentive and I ask him a lot of questions, which he likes to respond to with “I don’t know”, so I give him time to think and I try to help by using prompting questions before explaining the answer to him in simple terms, but I’m never sure if he quite understands because he doesn’t ever seem interested in asking questions. He likes to go off-topic a lot and talk seemingly non-stop about gaming, to which I try to redirect the conversation to the studying material, but it takes some time for him to let it drop. And after I feel he understands the concepts when he answers the practice questions right, he tends to forget everything we went through by the following session, and forget to do the homework I assign him. I know he’s a really smart kid, but I feel like part of the problem is that he doesn’t care. Could I get some advice on how I can improve my skills as a tutor in this situation?"

caseydaisy	2021-03-08 15:27:02+00:00	"I tested positive for COVID, but I’m teaching virtually."	"On Sunday, I tested positive for covid so I felt comfortable taking off today, Monday. My symptoms are mostly mild, but coming in waves. I’m also 13 weeks pregnant.

Today, my throat is sore, my voice is nearly gone, and I feel tired.

I also struggle with anxiety and impostor syndrome feelings, which lead to complicated feelings about attendance at work, especially at a high-performing school with high expectations for teacher attendance.

How long is it reasonable to take off work, considering:
- we’re teaching remotely so I’m no danger to anyone
- I’d like to preserve some leave for pregnancy and healthy child checkups
- I didn’t think to ask urgent care where I got my rapid test for a doctor’s note (could I ask my OBGYN to provide one?)
- I don’t know how much I’m not able to teach vs. my anxiety is telling me I’m not able to teach vs. my anxiety telling me I’m being lazy and should get back to work ASAP


I guess it also depends on my district, but I’m pretty sure it’s a standard three+ days requires a doctor’s note.

Part II I didn’t know I was in for:
Thanks for your advice and trying to sympathize with the inner workings of an anxious/impostor mind. (Also any advice about this, especially as I begin to care for another human soon, is more than welcome.

I’ve seen 4 different therapists/counselors in the past 5 years about numerous struggles, but most seem to just listen and not push me to try new strategies, give me “homework,” or hold me accountable in any way. Even when I try to ask for that awkwardly, I still feel unchallenged. I feel better on the whole afterward, but not motivated to make real change.

Am I looking for the wrong kind of therapist? It is positively exhausting finding one with openings who “fits” you."

Graduated June 2020 (in the middle of the shit storm lol), and just got an LTO in a 2/3 split.  Its my first time being back in the class since my last placement in March 2020 (which was cut short) so the COVID teaching world is new to me.

The biggest thing I’m struggling with is phys ed.  I want to take my kids out every day either for phys ed or just some dpa but the covid rules in my board are no physical contact (ovi) and no equipment.  The no equipment is stumping me the most.  When we have snow, building is definitely a great option.  I’ve also bought a massive pack of sidewalk calk (from indigo of all places!  60 pack for $15!) That I will split up and the kids can keep theirs in a plastic bag in their desk so we can draw things on the ground like hop scotch, or circles for playing rock paper scissors queen.

Does anyone have any resources or other games or activities I can do with my students (preferably outside) without equipment or physical contact?  Anything is helpful!"
quelayla	2021-03-05 07:42:43+00:00	I resigned and I got berated for it.	"So, I resigned, and my principal has been awful about it. Claimed I'd ""used"" her (yeah, right, because I've asked for fucking nothing I'm not entitled to by contract and put in way more than is required, just like every teacher). Told me off (yes, like a child) for emailing my resignation rather than booking a meeting with her. I've always worked corporate and we always formally email resignations, so I did what I knew to do. And hello...I heard precisely what happened last year when someone had a meeting with her to resign, why the hell was I going to walk into her screaming at me!

Furthermore, I sought advice about my resignation from a senior, trusted staff member in confidence who also told me the way forward was to resign in email and then await the summons. Well, the summons didn't come, just a brief, rude conversation in the staffroom at break in which she attacked me while at the same time saying, ""this is not the time or place for this"" and when I offered a meeting thinking she might just want to vent some more at me in private, she said no, she had nothing more to say. So really, she simply wanted to tell me off to save her own fucking ego in her own little mind. I think less of her now than I ever did before, but then that has been waning for some time, too. I wish I could tell her that if she wants to be approached, she should be approachable. But she's the ice queen.

I was told by a student last year that her nickname amongst students at her previous school was ""Ice"" and I'm sure it's through the student body here now, too. The seniors this year hate her with a passion. She undermined their senior pledge, outright rejecting their idea and replacing it with one of her own. The ridiculous part is that their pledge was a part of the school brand, being ""wellbeing"" except in the indigenous language. For someone who has been pushing embracing indigenous culture and language, why she rejected that is beyond me, and the seniors. They are salty as fuck.

So, this is my rant, and I'm glad I'm leaving. I'm sure my new school will have its own culture problems, I have an inkling of them already, but at least it won't be an egomanical, snobby, rude principal."

Due to some odd circumstances I may be moving to WA at the end of the year. 

Recently in my final classes my professors were discussing going into a master program through the school, I doubt I would be able to attend from far away but mostly I was concern that with a teacher shortage on the brink schools may not be hiring new teachers with Masters because of the extra cost. I was told this is a myth, is that true? Or are they just trying to get me to enroll into THEIR masters program?

At the beginning of the year, the kids were all virtual and the didn't have equal access to devices or internet connection. Many of them didn't get ChromeBooks from the school until January (and internet access can still be an issue for some). In the middle of the 2nd quarter, some of the kids we're brought in for hybrid learning while others stayed virtual. After a few weeks, it went back to all virtual. Starting in February, they are back to some students doing hybrid schedules where they're in person about 80% of the time, while about half the class is still virtual.

With all this happening, it's been challenging to get kids to turn in work. My mother tried to be kind to them grade-wise for the first couple quarters because of all of the challenges, but by now, there's really no excuse for them not turning things in. She's told them she needs at least 2 assignments per week per subject turned in in order to get a fair assessment. She turned out a missing assignment list asking for specific work. She's asked the parents for help. She's made it so they can turn in homework online, in person, or by taking pictures and texting, but they still aren't completing work.

They grade on a 5 point scale based on the kids' abilities to demonstrate understanding of the standards, so when there's no work turned in, it's hard to fairly measure their progress. Many of them were behind coming into this school year and she's finding it difficult to be able to catch them up. She's also falling behind in the curriculum that needs to be covered because she's been trying to catch them up and get them to submit work and because the school schedule has changed so much.

So, how are you guys handling grading? Are students turning in work consistently? How are you making it fair? Are you keeping up with curriculum? Are students behind from the interruption at the end of last year?

Thanks for all you guys do for your classes and for any pointers."

 'get the hell out of my classroom with that bigotry'

'then I guess you and your family clearly don't have any respect for anyone but yourselves' 

Finally what I wanted to say to a para after I mistakenly thought I could vent to them about students insisting there should be a white history month, but instead I just stood there dumfounded;
'Saying ""some black people say so too,"" about a comment which may sound bigotted to some, only makes you sound like a bigger more ignorant bigot, (unless you are a black person saying other black people think so too but this was said by a white women). If y'all want to flip the script, ignoring that white people are the ones with the systemic power (who wrote most of the history books we use in school) then tell me this, would it ever make any sense at all to say ""some white people say so too""? 
No! it would just sound like nonsense being blown out your ass, pretty much no matter what the sercomstances was, so why do you think it's any less stupid to say that about a minority group?!? 

Just in case of back lash, I'm not talking about quoting someone directly, that would be far more appropriate than ""some black people say...""  followed by racist misinterpretations of thing that might have been said by notable POC but is probably just the racist's way of convincing themself they aren't a racist.

"I’m a high school language teacher at a charter school and I’m getting my MAT simultaneously—or, I was, until my job told me that I had to use my PTO to attend my graduate-school courses. Some background on my job: my workday ends at 5, but the students are now done with school at 1:30, when before the pandemic and they were in person, their school day was until 4. Teachers are meant to stick around to be available to them for “office hours” which maybe 4 children total visit virtually every week.

When I first started working there pre-pandemic, they allowed me to leave early (4:30, when there were no children around) without taking my PTO, which put me in an extremely tight squeeze having to take the trains etc, but I made it work. Now, when the children are out of the building early (but teachers still have to stay)  I was told I had to take PTO for wanting to walk home (a 30-minute trek away) to have the privacy to take my classes so I can be certified to work at my school.

Obviously, I think this is unnecessary. I want to be certified, and I thought my school would be interested in having a certified teacher in my subject around as there are very few of these in my field; the subject I teach mostly shows up at private &amp; parochial schools. On top of that, I’m the only teacher in this subject that they’ve had stay for longer than a year before leaving; other teachers in my subject around the city know the school’s reputation for high turnover, so my school struggles to fill this position, which is a subject required for them to offer as per their charter. Mid years are coming up, and I’ve learned that my pay is now being affected by my not being certified. 

Is this a normal practice at schools and I’m just whining, or do you think I can negotiate that they do not take my PTO—already precious, as we no longer have COVID leave— in my contract renewal meeting? Thanks in advance for your fair advice."

Each annotation can be a simple note, or something that links to external resource so that the students can read more around the subject.

Since she and her students loved it so much, I decided to share it with everyone. 

It's also good for a student to create notes so then can refer them later as well. You can also share the link to a presentation with your students or colleagues, so they can view it as well.

I plan on adding flashcards, polls and more in future.

I've always liked school, and I've always known I would end up back in school for work at some point, but I've also always suffered from social anxiety. When I would have to get up in front of a class and give a presentation, I would always freeze up, and I have all the typical ""bad"" speech qualities (pacing, stuttering, going too fast due to nervousness, freezing up, etc). However, I don't want this to stop me from being a teacher. I'm wondering if anyone else here had to overcome their social anxiety to be able to teach, and if so, what steps they took to overcome it.

Also if anyone is curious, I've done a decent amount of volunteering including leading activities for students in a classroom, so I do have a little experience in a classroom and I know teaching is for me. That's why I'm asking about how to overcome my anxiety and not if I should even pursue teaching or not."

Of course we talked about Stephen F Austin and San Houston, but today we discussed Selena (not Gomez, but the og Selena 😉) and it was such a FUN lesson! That’s the first time this year that I’ve said that and even if it was just for a few minutes I was actually happy today. I’m doing hybrid but even my online kids were excited and all of them had heard her music before! Their assignment consisted of them dancing to a Selena song and uploading the video to Seesaw. I told my face to face students that I would dance with them (socially distanced of course) and be in their video and you should’ve seen their faces!!! They were excited (some nervous) as I went around and played music and danced a few seconds with them! 

Now I’m sitting here stressing out about planning for next week 😤 when all I want to do is continue dancing lol"

First year teacher here. I’m starting a unit on Hamlet and....I hate to say it...if teaching Shakespeare was hard before, it’s horrible to teach it during the pandemic. 

We just finished analyzing Hamlet’s first soliloquy, the one with all the Greek myth references, and a few of my kids asked me if we could do mythology instead (little do they know mythology is in my wheelhouse). 


Would it be wise to change the curriculum? They’re not engaged EXCEPT that one conversation. 

Should I stick to “Hamlet” despite zero to no input?

fruhlingsblumen1	2021-02-25 14:37:06+00:00	Feeling like it’s time to stop	"Apologies for the long post but my situation is specific! 
I’m an kindergarten assistant teacher at a private school. This is my first time teaching in a traditional school setting. My background and passion is mostly in theatre, but I taught classical theatre to young people for the past couple of years pre-pandemic, but i was laid off like most theatre artists. 
When I moved back home due to this, I got my current job. Going into it, I expected that being an assistant meant being present for the kids and taking care of them throughout the day, giving the classrooms care and working on administrative/busy work for the teachers. 
When I started, I was asked to teach a 25 minute lesson because the teachers were teaching something else at the same time. I said okay, not really knowing or understanding what this all meant or really that it was a daily lesson. It was my very first week at this place and I had no idea what I was getting into. 

i’ve continued teaching the lesson and I try to have fun with it. But it’s very stressful to be doing something I am not qualified for. Since this, i’ve been asked to do a lot of extra things in my job and I am being used as a third teacher in many ways, while still making assistant salary. I got a small raise, but it doesnt make up for the toll on my mental health. My days have become really exhausting because of the amount of things i’ve been asked to do, while my lead teachers’ only feedback when asked has been hurtful and microaggressive (I’m the only Black teacher at the school). 

I feel stuck. I cannot stop thinking and talking about school after I leave. I wake up sobbing and I try to find ways to make things better but I have no energy and nothing is working. I’m depressed and haven’t felt truly happy since winter break. I know I don’t want to do this but I feel bad quitting because the kids really really love me (I’m a naturally empathetic and fun person to be around, and I talk to them like people) and so do the parents. Can anyone help me in any way?"

bonjourlawrence	2021-02-25 07:29:18+00:00	Question about the purchasable Praxis practice tests and my results.. (5081)	"So, I need to take the 5081 exam to get into graduate school to become a teacher. I was quite worried based off of what I read here on how hard/easy it was and so I bought some resources including the practice exams.

I just took one to see where I might be and how hard it theoretically is.. I got 77 right and 58 wrong (lol). But, according to Google, I take 77 right out of 130 and get 59.23% which to get to the out of 200 scale they do, you simply add 100 and so I'd have gotten 159 (or 160 or 158 depending on up or down rounding) and in the state of Kansas all you need is 158.

That's cutting it close and I know the practice exam isn't the actual test but it's a major confidence boost that without studying for one minute, I passed the practice exam.. albeit barely. It's also shocking you could miss 58 questions and still pass.

Is this accurate? Thoughts?

Thanks in advance. I'm not trying to skate by but.. it just gives me peace of mind."

"I've scrapped the structured Morning Meeting in favor of Cursive Morning Wake-Up, where my third graders spend their first 20 minutes easing into the day by learning a new letter and practicing with it. Cursive practice doesn't take up a lot of mental bandwidth, so while this is going on, we make small talk and get some good SEL in. I'm also circling the room like a helpful shark, giving praise and advice.

It's such a lovely way to start the day, you guys. It seems to help them get into the learning mindset first thing - cursive is a very grown-up skill, and progress is easy for them to discern. Plus, not only do the kids love learning it, I've had at least a half dozen parents thank me for teaching it. 

(Honestly, I don't even care if the kids continue to write in cursive on the regs; I just want them to be able to read it. Don't tell them I said that.)

I’m going to be student teaching in the fall. I currently work as a TA in a special education classroom in an elementary school. I am enrolled in my last year of my masters in inclusive elementary special education in inclusive settings. 

Should I student teach where I work or experience a new school to network my experience? 

And...

Do you have any tips on how to get the school district to be interested in hiring you as a full time teacher after student teaching? Should I ask to be observed? I am anxiously dreaming about having my own class and I want to do everything I can to impress my future student teaching elementary school. I know in reality I’ll have to sub before, but a girl could always dream about being hired as a teacher after graduation!

dunkinqueef	2021-02-24 22:58:33+00:00	Horrible student teaching experience	"Ah, the joys of student teaching during covid. As if teaching virtually through this experience isn't bad enough, my mentor teacher is a bitch from hell who only ever tells me what I'm doing wrong and never what I'm doing right.

The school district doesn't have the budget to give student teachers school-issued laptops, which is already annoying enough in itself that I have to use my own technology for work. My shitty macbook only has one USB-C port so it's very difficult to use the elmo document camera because when I use the converter with it, my computer dies since I can't be simultaneously charging. Because of this, my computer died mid-instruction and I had to borrow my mentor's laptop to finish the math lesson. She was extremely angry and said I made her ""very frustrated"" and ""needed to stop asking for so much help."" This is a common pattern - critiquing things like the technology aspect (which I'm learning and doing my goddamn best with) and gives me no feedback on my actual teaching. I KNOW I'm a qualified teacher because my mentor at my last placement (and all others I've worked with) have told me so, yet my current woman writes me horrible reviews for making innocent mistakes with things like technology. How am I supposed to learn if she gets so angry with me every time I make a mistake? Student teaching is supposed to be about taking risks and learning, not constantly feeling like I'm walking on eggshells and terrified of disappointing.

After the incident, I said ""I'm so sorry this happened. It won't happen again"" to which she responded ""How can you know that? You can never predict when you're going to make a mistake. Don't say that to me."" Like...? What else do you want me to say then? And if you acknowledge that it's a 'mistake' why are you yelling at me and writing me horrible feedback reviews?

I am very discouraged. And also nervous that this bitch is going to ruin all of my job prospects and all I've worked towards for years will be for nothing. \*pours wine\*"

I had an unannounced 90 minute observation yesterday.  The notes I got were horrendous.  
I am teaching hybrid (13 in person, 9 online simultaneously).  We’ve been hybrid for a month. The first half of the year was completely remote. 
Some of the highlights were that I was “fluctuating between the in class kids and the computer kids” (um
Yea.  That’s how it works.  Don’t get the choice of words though...)
That kids didn’t raise their hands enough (there was some calling out but it was a discussion &amp; I wasn’t concerned).  I have the toughest group in the building (as mentioned by the rest of the staff). 
There were so many negative things he pointed out.  It was truly disheartening.  He said the floor was messy (we have art in the room and the teacher ran over her time- so they hadn’t cleaned up yet).  
He commented on the fact that all of my “polices and procedures” are not listed or posted on the wall.  And that one kid got pissy and put his head down on his desk.  (I’ll take that over an outburst any day). He also noted that three kids were on their computers (which is seen as a negative- yet it’s required for the math program we have.) 

No mention of the fact that we just started working on some new things and the last two days have been the best my kids have had since we’ve been back.  No mention of the fact that a kid that has outbursts almost daily had an amazing day with his new “work for chart”.  No mention that the kids were excited about their math skills. 
Did he not see same lessons I saw?  The kids were working, answering questions, working on multiplication and getting excited that they got it. We were quietly laughing and joking a bit.  They all handed in their work, aside from one kid.  Then for reading they did a great job with learning how to use a new reading notebook. They came up with great points about the character from our mentor text .  They took notes and shared their ideas.   
Sigh.  It’s never enough.  This just sucks.  I have over 15 years experience as a teacher.  Yet I find myself truly wondering what other jobs to apply for."

Anyway, I have some close friends that teach in the Kansas City, Kansas area.. wealthy suburbs.. and they have summers almost entirely off. They travel during breaks in the school year. They don't seem to work much on the weekend. And on and on. But, I did have a previous relationship where this girl did Teach For America, worked in an incredibly disadvantaged school and she cried her eyes out every night and quit after a few months if I recall.

I also come here and see a lot of I've had it posts, granted Covid and the past year complicates things in regard to the nature of my question.  But, am I wrong in thinking that teachers who work in more affluent areas have ""easier"" jobs, less stressful lives, etc. or is there anything else I'm missing?

All of my students have emotional disabilities, but a few have some academic deficits. I have had this one student for 7th grade and now 8th grade, and he had me as his resource math teacher. At the beginning of 7th grade, he and I were working on basic multiplication, division, fractions, and graphing. Now that he’s in 8th grade, we’ve actually worked our way up to working on 2-step equations, distributive property, and more abstract math concepts. He’s much more aligned to the standard 8th grade curriculum so I decided to have him try out a gen Ed math class today. 

He killed it. He even walked the class through solving a problem that the whole class was struggling with. I told his dad, and his response was, “I can not even articulate how thankful I am for you.”"

I recently started my PgCE in September and have a great placement in an art class at a college with students who have additional needs. 

There are a few that have emotional and social needs, with a wide range of abilities. (Ranging from anxiety and depression to ADHD and ASD).

We are starting in classroom teaching again next month as it has just been online and they have just seen me from the chest up, and I’m in need of a little advice as I have been overthinking this issue.

I have scarring on my arms, most being older ones but some that have happened within 12 months. The last thing I want to do is trigger any students that struggle with this, but they are so eager to see my tattoos as I am heavily covered. It seems like such a stupid question, but do I wear long sleeves at all times or not? 

I think it would be beneficial for students to see that obstacles can be overcome (I’ve struggled but overall am on a great career track), but at the same time want to protect them from any triggers.

Sorry if this is longwinded and/or pointless, I am just very worried about harming my learners, any comments are appreciated!"

I’ve posted here before. 24, teacher from the US; IL to be exact. I’ve just gotta vent. Currently we are on lunch break and I’m just feeling so so so defeated this year. I feel like a terrible teacher, I feel like my poor firsties are going to go to second grade unprepared. I feel like I’m doing everything I can, but still not enough. 

It’s so frustrating to be a teacher because the pressure is insane— a lot of people don’t realize this. The pressure to move kids further along academically, even amongst ALL OF THE BARRIERS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. Like come on and give me a break here. Internet issues, connection, digital exhaustion, parent schedules and availability, lack of resources, and just the fact that we are still experiencing and trying to survive through a pandemic here!!! It’s all so tough to navigate and while I know it’s out of my control somehow it still seems like I’m at fault. ON TOP OF THE SHIT PAY. I mean come on. I feel like I work my life away sometimes for the barest of the bare minimum. From admin, parents, hell even my own friends and family still think I’m a babysitter. It’s infuriating because I think to myself: do you want to work that hard and burn yourself out year after year after year just to be paid shit and at the same time be looked down on by society?? I’m not looking for praise, just respect. I feel like we deserve more, so much more. It just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the mental strain, the constant scrutiny, the constant criticism from those that have NO IDEA what’s it’s like to be us. 

I’m in my 3rd year and I’m already questioning how much more I can take. I’m not sure this profession is even good for my mental health at this point. It sucks because this is what I wanted my WHOLE life (in 1st grade I decided I was gonna do this) and now I’m wondering why I didn’t choose a different path. I LOVE the kids and the bonds, my coworkers are great, but at some point burn out really does set in. This is not to discourage pre-service teachers either. Fight the good fight for sure, I’m just tired man. Just tired. I’m all over the place. I guess I just needed to say that. Would love some words of encouragement or positivity. Also if I need to get out while I can, you can say that too. Take care friends, I hope you are all well!"

uhohoreolas	2021-02-22 16:28:46+00:00	Considering moving from classroom to counseling and would like advice	"I'll get right down to it: I am not thrilled with the way schools and school systems are handling mental health. I definitely think there has been a large step in the right direction, but as an elementary classroom teacher, I am often frustrated by the lack of time and resources that students with mental health issues are being given. I could go on about how I wish I personally had more time and resources to help, but to keep it brief, I would like advice on whether or not going the route of a counselor is worth it and if anyone has found success with the process. 
I have a bachelor's in K-6, so I would definitely need to go back to school to get my masters in counseling. I like the idea that I could stay in education but also be able to move into private counseling as I get older (I'm in my 3rd year teaching). 

I tend to be an impulsive person and really would appreciate some advice! I know many of us have been thinking of career changes after this year and I'm hoping this isn't a ""grass is greener"" moment for me. If there is a better sub to ask this, please let me know that too. Thanks!"
BenjiBuster	2021-02-22 16:04:28+00:00	Looking to switch careers to become a teacher	"Hello! I am looking to become a teacher and could use some guidance. I live in Illinois (Chicago), have a Bachelors in Business Administration from the University of Miami (Florida), and a Masters from Chicago Booth. I have no formal degree or training around education.

I have been unable to find a crystal clear resource that outlines the path to become a teacher when I have degrees, but not in education. I think I need to get an ""Illinois Alternative Teacher Certification."" Is this the only way? This appears to be a 2-year program where ""candidates teach full time for two school years under the mentorship and coaching of an experienced teacher.""

Is the above program all I need to do? Do I get paid for the two years I am teaching in the program? Are there any quicker alternatives? Do I need this license to teach at private schools/would they hire someone without it?

Thank you all for your help!"

I'm new to this page, so I apologize if this not the most appropriate setting, but I'm currently looking for new ideas to supplement my current income. I currently work as a para for a small school in western Massachusetts. Since it's my first year, my hourly wage is not great, and I don't get paid for school vacations, so my upcoming paycheck is not going to be great.

I am surely, SURELY, not the only educator with this issue lol, so what do you all do during this period? I'm in the process of applying for SNAP benefits, I will be on a MASSHealth care plan in June, and I'm currently doing surveys (i.e Swagbucks, Usertesting) and selling clothes on Poshmark/ Mercari for additional income, but I'm wondering if there is a more streamline way to just get a few more bucks in each week.

Lonely_Bit_6844	2021-02-22 08:26:31+00:00	Not sure about teaching. What else can I do?	"I am having a bit of a career path crisis. I studied journalism and worked in that field for a few years, while I love writing, I found my job in newspaper journalism (where I ended up) too stressful. I taught English abroad for a few years and though it was also quite chaotic I enjoyed working with children and being a bit fun and theatrical. Came home and didn't know what to do, after some deliberation I decided to do a postgraduate certificate in teaching (2 years). For some reason I imagined teaching as a relatively calm profession, with kind and gentle colleagues. I suffer from generalized anxiety and OCD and am trying to learn to work with myself and not put myself in situations that are not good for me. Through practical work I have found teaching to be more stressful than I thought, and people that work with children less kind and supportive than I thought. I am tempted to quit my studies (I am halfway though), but reluctant to throw away the last year of hard work, so now I am wondering, is there any alternative for someone like me, with a writing background and teaching certification? Like some kind of educational writer/textbook author etc? Please, any suggestions are welcome :)

TL;DR: I'm a writer with anxiety who is halfway through a teaching certificate but I'm not sure that teaching is for me!"

honey__vee	2021-02-20 06:05:47+00:00	TEA gave every school in the state of Texas 3 free bad weather days that we wouldn't have to make up at the end of the year. My district didn't take any of them.	"I'm a first year teacher in a small school located in West Texas. As most everyone has heard by now, Texas was hit with an insane snow storm that has caused water outages, rolling blackouts due to an energy crisis, and many deaths across the state. The area I live in has had a consistent 6+ inches of snow on the ground for an entire week (which is record breaking in Texas). The roads have been iced over and slushy at best. People in the surrounding area have lost power and/or water in these extreme low temps.

Due to this extreme weather, TEA gave everyone 3 free bad weather days so that we could stay home and stay safe. But what did my school do? Made everyone come in at 8:00 for a full day of school on Tuesday morning after Presidents day and drive through the ice and snow. Not even a late start!! So then, when we get news that we're next on the list of possible blackouts to conserve power, the school tells us we'll have a late start on Wednesday and we'll only go home if the power is off for more than an hour. Well that's great! We only have to freeze our butts off for an hour before we get to go home. So the snowmageddon continues, but we never lose power (thankfully, but the weather was still horrible) and administration decides we don't need a late start for Thursday, so come on in at 8:00 again! It's not like the roads are even slushier than before due to the melting and refreezing that's been occurring for the past week! Today was the first day that the sun actually came out and I didn't have to pry my garage door open just to get to school on time. We could have stayed home and stayed safe Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and NEVER have to make up those days and then showed up on Friday when it was warm and safe!!! Literally every other school in a hundred mile radius closed for at least one day and most did late starts for the rest.

And to top it all off, when one of my fellow teachers asked my principal why we weren't using the free bad weather days, he said he'd never heard of those until she mentioned them. This means either 1- The superintendent never told the principals about them to keep it under wraps and hope no one noticed or 2- He absolutely knew about them and lied to her face to make it seem like he's not the bad guy.

I'm exhausted, I'm cold, I'm emotionally drained, and most of all, I'm tired of getting jerked around by a school that doesn't give a shit about protecting it's teachers and students."

Mainly, because I’ve been teaching middle school when my heart is more with primary. So I hope when I get a primary position my love for education is sparked again. HOWEVER, I’m curious about keeping my options open. I want to get my masters as it helps with getting a higher pay, especially in the long run if I stick with teaching as a life long career. What I’m curious about is does your masters have to be related to education to get that bump up on the pay scale? Or could you essentially have a masters in anything and still move up on the salary schedule? Does anyone have a masters in something not education related and can speak to this?"

Danley2055	2021-02-18 17:08:20+00:00	"I love teaching, but...."	"Let me begin with some backstory. Ive been teaching for 5 years and have a Bachelors degree. Single, no kids, renter. I now fully understand the money I make, will make, and what my future will hold with a career as a teacher. I don’t have a “plush” life, I get by paycheck to paycheck with a little to save. Frankly, I’d really like to make more money and I don’t want to go back to college. 

I love teaching! It really does make me happy to work with kids and feel like I am making a difference. With that being said, recently I was approached by a good friend. He owns and operates a boys group home that serves at risk youth and loves it! He loves it for all of the same reasons I love teaching:helping kids, teaching them to be better, and doing something meaningful. It’s a vastly different job but I feel holds a lot of similarities to teaching. 
He is looking to expand his agency and open more homes. He said he immediately thought of me when he wanted to expand and felt I’d be great at this. He broke down the numbers and I’d be making double what I make as a teacher! 

I am curious what you’d do if given an opportunity like this?

I know that I can always teach if I keep my license current. I do love teaching, I really do, but with the poor pay and the current online environment I am constantly thinking of ways I can make more money because what I (we) make now isn’t enough. I couldn’t support a family on what I make now."
peterpanalot	2021-02-18 16:47:47+00:00	My philosophy is changing	"I can feel my philosophy towards education changing and I think it is taking a cynical turn. 

I am a math teacher for a high school setting and I teach a class that is basically an advanced version of Algebra 2. The students that are in that class should be students trying to get prepared for higher math, but it's a mix of students with a variety of needs. 

Today, they were talking to me about a student that wants to drop out of school and make music. He says he is going to be in the studio with Kanye in a month and he is going to make it big. It becomes a joke with my students in my class and I definitely overreacted to that situation and started ranting to them about how rap only really gets good if the person is educated or if the rap actually says something meaningful about the life that they live. My students looked surprised that I got so passionate about this topic and I apologized for taking up that time and getting carried away. Then, of course, my students were trying to get me to say more and take up more time, but instead, I told them that we needed to get started with our material today. 

I looked at the board and we were working with graphing lines and I just said to myself ""This seems so stupid now."" Like, I started to think about myself in high school struggling with my sexuality and my friend group. I was so worried about all of that and it caused me to be distracted from my school work, but I haven't thought about that in years. After that moment up at the board, I could tell students were not paying attention to me and were concerned with their own drama in their heads. I felt so worthless standing up there talking about lines. I felt like they honestly didn't care about anything I had to say and I know that is me spiraling, but I just can't get out of my head that anything I do won't even stick in their heads. 

I just felt so defeated in 47 minutes even though my students didn't say/do anything disrespectful and it was all me. Sorry if this didn't make any sense, I just needed a place to vent."
tkcal	2021-02-18 16:32:24+00:00	(Help). Looking for advice on running a discussion moderation class	"Hi everyone

I'm teaching at a university looking to change things up in a class that hasn't been running as well as I'd like. It's a content/skills based class where the main piece of assessment is the moderation of a discussion topic.

We spend time discussing key skills - paraphrasing, reflecting, active listening, inviting participation, open ended questioning...but last semester - especially in an online environment - this really didn't work.

Typically what would happen is that the student/s moderating that week's discussion come with their topic, introduce it and then - however is appropriate for them - invite participation. Might be a controversial statement or question, an ethical conundrum.. a straight up ""how do you feel about this?""...whatever.

It was a very quiet semester. From the safety of their own study's/lounge rooms and behind their screens, the students didn't feel any huge necessity to contribute and as such, a lot of the moderation turned into monologues or increasingly frazzled yes/no questioning.  


It's a model i'd like to change - i just don't quite know how.

I'm toying with the idea of somehow introducing topics myself and then choosing a few students at random to demonstrate skills - but I can see this not being interactive at all. I like and I want a little chaos - it's a good chance to demonstrate some of the key skills - but that's not going to work if I'm steering the ship from the front each week.

This is just a bit of a Hail Mary in case any of you beautiful people have any ideas that may help me. Thanks for taking the time to read this."
Unique_Importance_94	2021-02-18 15:18:19+00:00	TA Should I become a teacher?	"So I graduated with a BS in Middle school math and received a nc teaching license in 2016.  I had anot so good student teaching experience. I got a C+. I tried hard to get a teaching job in one of the biggest counties but faced obstacles and limitations due to not having a car.

 I finally secured amid year TA job that year and continued in that position until the june 2018. I again tried to get a teaching job and had interviews. I was able to secure a long term math sub position for 7th grade. I basically did all the teacher work for sub pay with little support. It was hell especially after the kids found out i was a sub. I ended up switching positions mid year back to a TA at that same school until june 2019. My teaching license expired that month and was non renewable. 

I then had some mental health problems and moved back to eastern nc where i secured various part time jobs. Finally in nov 2020 i was able to get back into the school system as a TA again in a smaller district. I want to try teaching again but it is unlikely I will find a job in this small district as teachers tend to stay until retirement.

Should i continue being a TA for another year and save money so I can move and get a teaching job in a bigger district? Should I consider going outof state to GA maybe?

Basically i think im ready to be a teacher but i also have anxiety about trying to teach so many years after i have been out of my subject and have barely any teaching experience."

belladisordine	2021-02-15 21:06:11+00:00	How do you compartmentalize and care less?	"Hi all, 

I am recovering from another anxiety attack / mental break down because of teaching. 

For the fourth time this school year, my admin has micromanaged and undermined what I teach and how I keep my grades. And I just can't anymore. 

At first, admin extended late work acceptance from one day to five days. OK. 

Then, we were told to drop the three lowest grades (1 day before grades were due and most of us had already submitted final grades.) Awesome. 

Next, we are being told to accept late work up until the week before grades were due and no grades lower than 59% on late work. 

I accepted all of these changes with minimal rebuff because they don't really impact my group of students. I don't have many students failing. 

Where I lost my beans was being told to change my extra credit so that it is the same across 7th grade science grade level. I am the only 7th grade science gifted teacher. So my lessons will cover the same topics as regular level, but obviously I do things a little differently. My extra credit was for students to find four news articles related to our content and summarize them. I think that is worthy of 5 percentage points, which is the value of extra credit. The regular class teacher wants the kids to do ONE take home lab. I do not think that is challenging/engaging enough for my kids. She went to admin, and I'm now being told to do the lab and not my current events. 

I don't know how to let this one go y'all. This other teacher said in private emails that she wants to do the lab because it's easy to grade. She doesn't want to do something that has 4 parts to it. I feel this lab is a disservice to my students. I think it is crucial for them to make connections from our content to the real world. 

I have been continually told to lower my standards for my students this year and I've just had it. I can't let this extra credit thing go. 

I feel like I've disconnected as much as I can already. I don't take work home with me. I don't answer emails outside of school time. I take mental health days for myself.  I've let go my frustrations with the other grading policies. But honestly, this is the proverbial straw that broke my teaching back. 

Any advice?"
Muxika	2021-02-15 21:01:01+00:00	I Teach ELA/Reading Online. I have 75 Students. I have 80 Fs.	"Hi everyone,

I've been teaching in the States for 6 years now and I feel so embarrassed about the performance of my 8th Grade ELA and Intensive Reading students. The majority of my students are failing because they're either not turning in the work or they don't know *how* to turn in the work.

I really want to post the grades as-is for this interim period, so hopefully I can scare some of these students straight, but I believe some think they're going straight to high school, no matter how their semester grades or EOC assessments turn out. Also, admin will NEVER let those grades get published as they are.

I've been collaborating on lesson planning with 2-3 other teachers, and I'd think that my students would perform just as well as the other classes, but they're four times worse!

I don't know what's giving them trouble because I don't see the problems in the work that gets turned in. It's the missing work that's causing the failures.

I've already excluded several assignments from the quarterly interims, so they won't negatively affect those scores, but the failures are still there.

Is anyone else dealing with these similar problems, where you're trying to cut corners and trim the fat from your grade book, but nothing's working?

I'm just so deflated right now."

In hindsight I understand why there is animosity as I’m trying to step away from TEFLing but rather teach in international schools, and this was always my plan.

 Going forward at the current language school I work at here there are indeed restrictions in terms of material, mixed proficiency groups, lack of support but focusing on development /best practice throughout my degree has really helped me and my students. 

I hope this doesn’t come off as a rant, but I feel it’s needed to say in case anyone else who is TEFLing but wants become licensed or is looking to further develop their career."

Finding-Internal	2021-02-13 21:01:25+00:00	"We need more cute, educational videos to drown out the useless banal garbage our kids watch"	"As a parent, I am so frustrated by the useless garbage my children will park themselves in front of. They are getting too old for the educational kiddie stuff and now I have to contend with puberty-focused shows that are too old for my children, or just let them watch mindless videos of animals doing silly things.  Which are kinda funny and entertaining, but there is a void for things on their mental level (grade school).  

I tried to get my children to actively participate in solving this problem. I told them they might be famous YouTubers one day if they did it, so they agreed. For me it was just good for them to being doing something of variety during quarantine.   

We used their pet parakeet budgies to make videos that combined the ""cute animals"" concept with ""educational"".  The birds are Professor and Student, and they go through trying to teach different things. 

So far as the pilot, we've only touched on basic math. It takes a lot of work to make these videos and to keep the kids engaged. I have them doing all the voices and even doing the recording of the scenes.

But, they're losing momentum. In the beginning they were excited because we sent it off to a bunch of teachers in the local school systems, but apparently that is ""spam"".  So I am turning to our community here.

FIRST off -- I'm sharing so that teachers can perhaps use this as entertaining brain breaks for the students. I've seen what my kids get assigned during virtual learning. I've also seen what they watch at home. The idea is to just give them something educational and entertaining at the same time.

SECOND -- I want our community to subscribe to the channel so I can motivate the kids to do more videos. Once the subscriber numbers start climbing, I'll pitch to them how their fans want more good content and it is their responsibility to produce quality videos to help other kids.

&amp;#x200B;

So I hope this helps others, but of course I hope it helps us too. It is self-promotion, but I am under no delusions that the kids are going to become internet sensations by recording videos of their birds. I just like the idea of the ethic it teaches the kids and showing them amount of work involved in any venture. I am teaching them about video editing as well. I want them to stay as far away from the snapchat, instagram, tiktok ""selfies"" -- producing a good quality video without shamelessly promoting oneself. That said, before I get flamed, people have sent me some really good/beneficial/educational videos from tiktok, so I understand it is not all bad. We just have to work in the general sense and do our best to equip these young ones."

Impulse882	2021-02-13 05:15:21+00:00	So tired of lazy coworkers	"I think I’ve posted something similar before but I’m just so worn down today. 

Teaching remotely has been difficult for me, subject-wise.  My field is hands-on and even the best simulations aren’t even passable, in my opinion. 

Prior to covid I had been all for moving some material online but making sure student have the kinesthetic experience that is a required and expected component of the course.  When developing this years ago all my colleagues in the field were like “as long as you don’t put it FULLY online!” Which no prob, I agree with

But after a year of teaching remotely they have all suddenly changed their minds.  This can all be taught fully online, going forward, so they say, with no loss of content quality.

....these are physical things. Like, do you want a nurse or a surgeon who has *only* studied online working on you?

My colleagues say, “well they don’t really need this” (then why is it in the class in the first place?!) or “they’re sure to get that in this other class” (what if that other class is saying the same thing, but if this class?!)

I’m just so frustrated because NONE of the discussion is how these tools could make learning better - NONE- just how it could make scheduling and workload easier.  

When asked point blank how this helps students the most I’ve gotten is a vague “online is the future”

....Kay, but we’re supposed to be training them for the jobs of today, too.

It just drives me up the wall that they don’t realize or don’t care what they are doing not just in regards to the futures of our students, but to the reputation of teachers in general."

I started my PGCE in September, it's intense, especially this year but I'm getting a bit fed up of covid being used as an excuse. There is no support from the university and more importantly, my school. My emails never get replies, I get missed off of emails that are important. I'm being missed off of training emails and after an interview yesterday. I had an interview this week and it has made me realise that I am completely under prepared for getting an actual teaching job and I'm at my wits end with it all. 

I get told on Sunday evenings what lessons they want me to plan even though I have the curriculum overview I don't know where they're at with the curriculum until I get told, I've not got much access to the resources and I'm exhausted. 

I've not managed to do any normal life things and I never manage to leave the house and, you know when you just think, why the hell are you my mentor of all the people to have picked why do I get the one who seems to think I should be fending for myself when I have had no prior school experience.

Thankorish	2021-02-11 23:03:41+00:00	Advice for aspiring teacher with engineering degree.	"I graduated with a BSME in NJ, where I still live, back in May. Due to living at home with two elderly parents during the pandemic and a desire to stay around here for at least a couple more years until my SO finishes school, as well as admittedly poor networking skills, I haven't been able to secure a job in engineering. Throughout school, I always thought I was more suited to being a teacher, but went for engineering because of family pressure. Now I want to seriously consider becoming a HS math or physics teacher, and am looking for some answers from general teachers and those who went down a similar path.

1) With the pandemic on, is this a really stupid time to start as a teacher. 

2) Will the fact that I never had a job in industry hurt my pay or employment chances. Would a school looking to hire someone from an engineering into teaching background want to see experience in engineering.

3) Is the alternative route the best option, and does it matter what kind of program I use to get the CE. I'm a little confused on the differences between the programs listed; some count as graduate work, some undergrad, some listed as ""hours based"", and then either with or without a degree. What matters in these differences?"
PromptWhole386	2021-02-11 22:57:45+00:00	What do you all think of teaching platforms for teaching students?	"I am referring to platforms like Quizlet where teachers can make resources for their students, but students can also see resources from other teachers as well. The problem I see with Quizlet is that it's not really engaging in sense that we don't interact with teachers or other students, it's just the flashcards and the other tools they offer that you deal with. I don't doubt this isn't an effective way of learning but shouldn't there be some sort of peer to peer engagement, especially when learning has moved online recently? I think teaching platforms like Quizlet should have some social learning involved. That's just my thinking, looking forward to any input."

This is not directed toward anyone in particular on this subreddit, but rather I hope it serves as a PSA. 

I'm a relatively new teacher (&lt;5 years) and, honestly, going into teaching was a culture shock for me because of the toxic attitudes many teachers have toward their students.  
  
If you need to scream at your kids in order to get your point across, don't be a teacher.  
  
If you need to grab your kids in order to get your point across, don't be a teacher.  
  
I'm a firm believer in leading by example. So, if we want to raise kind, patient, and compassionate kids, we need to be kind, patient and compassionate ourselves. Yes, be stern when needed. Lord knows I have to be stern on occasion. But not once have I ever had to yell at a child, nor would I. It is poor behavior and sets a bad example. There are ways to be authoritative without needing to be loud.

bonjouretaurevoir	2021-02-11 15:16:46+00:00	Considering a career change from engineering to education	"I graduated with a biomedical engineering degree in 2019, had three co-ops and internships in the neuroimaging industry, and currently still work in it. A lot of different aspects have come into play for the career path I set myself on that are making me reconsider a career change from engineering to teaching (I originally considered it when I was graduating high school in 2014, but my parents strongly disapproved of it).

When you work in the computational side of the imaging sciences industry, where you have to create a visual representation of biological phenomena, you are expected to be self-motivated to create that picture that can convey a deeper meaning for doctors and researchers. In order to do this, you have to take part of two industries: biomedical engineering and software development. I love the theory behind it all, but I'm getting burnt out by the environment and the job search/grad school search I have been on. It's partly due to the specific company I work for, where there has been a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a caste-like system of roles in the lab depending on how many degrees you have. There's so many politics and cockiness about whether you have a PhD or not. My job is in this weird, obscure intermediate level where I get to interact a lot more with private investigators and be in touch with pretty high up professionals and scientists, but **I also teach technicians and engineers that are the 'lower' (hate saying that) level how to use a software development kit from a start-up company that we started a contract/collaboration with right before I started in August of 2019. This is the part that I enjoy the most out of my job, and I've gotten so many remarks about how I'm good at helping others learn and to feel motivated.**

**This is what I would want to get out of something I do 40 hours a week. That was about 20% of my job before, and now, because of a shift in responsibilities, pretty much 100% is writing software to translate some imaging analyses into the aforementioned start-up company's cloud service that I had to take on and learn and teach others about. Both the primary lab I work for and the start-up are overly ambitious and get so caught up in it, that there is a lack of documentation on how their commands and software work and I find myself just cranking out test commands and scripts and going back and forth on StackOverflow and suggesting what to write up in their documentation for a niche programming solution that best fits the needs at a very present time. It feels like I am working for two companies that just get a kick out of me doing their grunt work, and it's been very draining. Sometimes I'm not treated well about it either because I sometimes don't fully understand their original intentions behind the specific command.**

I still really like engineering and learning about how the research comes together, but so far in my path, I have to force myself to be a professional whose purpose is to only fulfill the grants of a select few rather than the growth of potentially a higher amount of others. I'm also realizing I'm at my happiest when I'm not on the computer as much anymore except for when I'm interacting with others. I'm isolated in my niche position and even more so as the result of my shift and the general direction in which I am headed (and COVID as well making everything remote). Looking around at jobs hasn't been any more hopeful for me, and I'm not as invigorated by the prospects as I used to be. Especially if the research is what kept me going, but I know I'm not the one to go for a PhD already (so don't recommend that for me). I know I can still read papers about it in free time.

Would going back to getting a teaching certification in HS Science (probably chemistry) be a good step? Is that a crazy, unrealistic move? Because of the initial reaction I had with my parents scoffing at me (and wasting my 'potential') I worry what others may think, as shallow as that sounds. I'm thinking of doing a MS that couples the student teaching and getting a degree and cert at the same time. I'm from PA in case anyone needs to know either.

Thanks in advance for reading my novel :)

Our admin projects us to have around 64% attendance rate from our students, which means we’ll have classes filled up and everyone still on their laptops for learning. I think the goal is to avoid making students at home feel left out.

What kind of format would best serve everyone in this set up? It seems absolutely ridiculous to have students come to class just to watch the screen all day. What are your experiences with hybrid? What do you recommend for my situation? Our admin is literally asking for ideas."

"My statistics teacher has started this teaching format where he gives us the lesson, and then afterwards he has the class discuss what they took from the lesson and ask questions if there was something they didn't understand. The main idea is that the teacher rarely gets involved after the lesson gets delivered and students learn among themselves through peer learning. There is some research to back this up as an effective method of learning.

As teacher's what do you all think of this style of teaching/learning? Is this something you all would be willing to try out?"
_______________77	2021-02-11 00:31:03+00:00	I don’t what level I want to teach...and I’m wondering if it’s worth it to teach at all.	"I’m a college sophomore and I’m at a crossroads when it comes to what I want to do as a career.

I’ve been interested in teaching for a while, specifically history as I love the subject and sharing that love and also helping students learn and grow seems like a very fulfilling job. However I’m unsure. When it comes to grade school teaching (I would be interested to teach on the high school level) I hear and read so much about how it’s awful.( It doesn’t pay enough, you’re overworked, disposable, parents and administrators don’t respect you, burn out is very likely etc.)  so I’m kinda rethinking teaching high schoolers. 

I am more interested, however, to teach at the post-secondary level yet I read that getting a full time job is near impossible as most institutions are hiring at only the part time level and tenure positions are highly competitive.I’m honestly not picky, I’d be fully content teaching at a community college but even that doesn’t seem likely. Teaching at a college would also leave me torn because I’m extremely against the cost of college in the US and teaching at an institution that (in my personal opinion) is completely taking advantage of students financially wouldn’t sit well with me. 

I would also strongly prefer to teach in a larger city (like Chicago, LA, NYC etc. I prefer urban over rural) I feel like that might not help me either.

I could use some advice if possible."

thesadoptomist	2021-02-10 22:57:11+00:00	What are your Policies for late work?	"I just started teaching in a classroom this November. I teach 6th grade science and my classes are hybrid (about 7 kids in person and 20 on zoom). My schools science department is pretty strict on not allowing kids to turn in work late. They tell me I shouldn't give extra credit or let kids redo tests or even do corrections. And if the kids turn in things late, they say I have to take off points or not accept it at all. 

I disagree with that philosophy. These kids are 11 and are having a way more difficult time than any of us have ever had due to COVID. My goal as a teacher is to have my kids learn and I think they'd be able to do that better in a stress free environment. I never take off points for late work and allow them to do corrections occasionally. Of course some may take advantage of this, but in my limited experience most have not. They respect me because I respect them. 

However, I recognize that this may be naive of me. I am in florida so I didnt have to go to school for teaching or even get a masters in order to teach in the classroom, so I dont have a formal teaching education. Plus, my coworkers have way more years of experience than I do so I cannot deny they know more than me. 

I was wondering what your thoughts on this was and how you handle late work and test corrections in your classrooms. Any thoughts would be appreciated :)

Tldr; what is your classroom policy on latework/test corrections? Do you think it is bad to let kids turn in work late with no penalties."

heiwayagi	2021-02-10 08:42:13+00:00	I made a difference in my students’ lives today but I still feel like a failure	"Today I know I helped a number of students feel better about themselves:
- one student came and saw me in the morning and said that I’d made her morning better
- in first period, I helped a student have more confidence in herself as she worked on the board to solve problems that she’s been struggling with
- in the same period, I made a student cry because I said she’s a kind, warm person who’s doing a great job
- another student in that class who has been feeling low because her friend died a month ago. She talked to her very supportive mum after school who called me to ask how to support her
- in my period 2 class, I managed to get 1:1 time with a highly anxious student who loves my Japanese classes. By lunchtime she was practicing her Japanese with strangers.
- in my free period, I checked in on a student who I spent an hour with the other day organising his books and I was very happy to see he took all his new books to class
- at lunch I helped a current student who will certainly be a future teacher to run a Japanese club- her first time doing so
- in my last period of the day, I spoke to a boy who’s been having trouble with his friends feel that he has a teacher who cares about him
- and during all that I helped train a new teacher who did a really good job

And yet I feel like a failure today. I can’t help but think of all the kids I’ve failed. They weigh heavy on my mind and make me feel like all the good things I’ve done are outweighed by the times I couldn’t help my students."
Shelbychildd	2021-02-10 07:58:29+00:00	Masters programs require teaching experience?	"Hi everyone,

I recently graduated with a BS in Fisheries and Wildlife. After much consideration and research, I’ve decided I want to pursue the middle-high route, specially in biology. 
All applications for Oregon programs, however, require teaching experience and many of those applications require a reference to back up the teaching experience. I have worked as a wildlife educator at a zoo where I talked about animals on stage, but it was a weird situation where my supervisor never saw me teach. I also volunteered VERY briefly a few years as a “mentor” where I helped kids after school with their homework. I only volunteered for a couple of months, once a week, before I went back to college. Would these positions count towards this “teaching experience” that’s required?
Also, if you went through a Masters program in Oregon, which school did you attend and how was you experience?

Thank you!"

I currently work at a charter school that is essentially a sinking ship. Lots of layoffs, declining enrollment rate, all the fun stuff that pretty much has this school ready to close in the next few years if things don’t change. 
My mother in law told me that there are jobs at a local public school opening up this coming fall as a bunch of teachers are retiring. I want to throw my name in the hat, but I’m unsure of how to do so since the jobs technically hasn’t been posted yet, but from the sounds of it people are already applying. 
Some people have told me I should just send my resume to them anyways, some say I should mail it, and some people have told me I should go in person. I have a few questions about this:
1. Is it bad to send my resume and stuff in in the middle of the school year? Does it show I’m unprofessional or noncommittal?
2. If I do send it in, do I take it in person or mail it? Should I give it to the district office or directly to the principal?
3. If by some chance I get an interview, how do I explain why I’m leaving my current school? 

When I got the job at my current school it was stupid easy. I applied online, did a five minute interview, and got the job. This time seems like it’ll be a lot more difficult, because a lot of people want these jobs. How do I make sure I do this properly every step of the way to make myself look as good as possible?"

"I have a team member, who is our team point person, who is making my life even more miserable than it has to be this year. Aside from the hybrid teaching, and general covid stuff, this woman has been a NIGHTMARE this year. We started the year with her having a sort of mental breakdown of sorts over a breakup. Now let me fill you in, this woman is my mother’s age, mid 60s. I had really looked up to her as  a mentor and professional last year, so I gave her some grace. But every day or the first two months of school my team members and I were subjected to wailing, crying, screaming, and tantrums when we weren’t teaching virtually. It got to the point where we all stopped coming and taught from home to avoid the drama and hysterics. We even all confronted her and said we were worried about her mental state. She was late to meetings or completely forgot about them, looked disheveled and was coming in wearing the same clothes multiple days in a row. It was shocking to watch and anxiety inducing to listen to her rant and cry on and on about this man she was only with for 6 months. Once that was over she turned her attention to the election and ranting about Qanon conspiracies she was reading about on Facebook. When we went back to F2F instruction I would hide in my classroom with the door locked and the lights off during planning so she wouldn’t come bother me. She noticed I was avoiding her and has now taken to questioning me about everything I am doing. What am I doing in my classes and what am I teaching? Trying to assert her dominance over me by quizzing me about all of my choices and instruction methods. Walking into my classroom while I’m teaching and listening in to my lessons outside the door. Quizzing my students outside in the hallway to make sure I am teaching them the standards. It’s not real harassment so I can’t go and complain. And I don’t want to be that whiny person who’s tattling to my boss but she’s making my job unbearable. I want to quit every day because I want to get away from her. I do t know what to do at this point. After having to stay home with my daughter today and getting a text from another team member that she was throwing a fit because I didn’t alert her and she’s the team lead, I sent a very passive aggressive email to my team about how I’m so sorry that while taking care of my sick child after not having slept all night and trying to pull together a sub plan I did not contact her directly. I’m just over it. And I don’t care what happens for sending that email. I’m just tired of her and her shit and almost wish I would get fired so I won’t have to deal with her anymore. I love my job and I love my subject area and I love my students, but having to put up with this woman’s negativity and emotional turmoil every day is getting to be too much."

She wants to go to Canada as soon as her M.Sc gets completed and grab a teacher's job (preferably grades 9-12) in Canada.

Can someone guide me how smooth is the process, how realistic her chances are and if she is offered what option she should do out of B.ed , M.ed or the teaching certificate?

Any and all advice is welcome."	"For some background, I'm an 8th-year high school English teacher with a master's in English. I interviewed to teach AP English 3 and they told me later they couldn't hire me for that role (didn't say why) although I interviewed strongly and my sample lesson was good, but they wanted me to come back to pitch them electives I'd like to teach. I've previously taught a debate class and created a curriculum completely from scratch for it, so I think that piqued their interest.

Here's the email they sent me:

""I am excited for your visit and interview on Friday, February 12th. We have you scheduled for 10:00-10:45 We love our elective roles at XXXXX, so this is a time to really demonstrate how engaging your class could be.

This will not be a traditional sample lesson interview. Instead, it is more like a “Shark Tank” pitch. We want our elective candidates to explain in detail 2-3 elective classes that they would like to teach. This could be 3 separate classes that are in the same genre. For example, Theater 1, Theater 2, and Poetry. This, however, could be 3 completely unrelated courses like Business, Yoga, and Intro to Engineering.

Please do not try to pitch ideas you think the students will like. Instead, pitch ideas that you are passionate about and can make come to life for our students. We want our students to have a great variety of choice with their electives and we want them to be taught well and with energy.

I attached a Course Catalog from the first XXXXXX. They did a great job of creating a robust course catalog. Please reference it as you are crafting your pitch.

If you have any questions or need to reach out in advance, my number is. Thank you again, and we can’t wait to see your presentation.""

Basically, I'm thinking of pitching them improv, theater - maybe a combo of both? Definitely debate since I still have all of my materials for that, and I'm kind of unsure about what else. Any ideas are welcome, but moreso any ideas about how I should pitch this or if anyone else has ever had an interview like this before and has any advice.

Thanks so much!"

Hi everyone,

I need advice on how to tell my potential new employer that I no longer wish to take the new teaching position I have been offered.

I applied at this school not thinking I would get an interview. Did get offered the interview, and then at the end of the interview I was offered the job. The interview was over video call so I did not see the school/the department I would be working with. I did ask about the school during the interview but I just received vague answers.

I initially asked for a couple of hours to think about the job offer, and the principal agreed but seemed pretty annoyed by my request. I did eventually agree to the offer but I have since received a better offer at my current school (more money). I don’t know enough about the new school, the staff or the area I will be working in and the job will be starting in less than 2 months (they advertised it only last week).

How do I go about telling the principal that I am taking back my acceptance of the job? I hate confrontation and I am feeling sick to my stomach about it. Nevertheless, I want to let the school know ASAP.

anaaki	2021-02-08 20:13:41+00:00	In desperate need of a lesson on getting along with others who have different beliefs/lifestyles than you	"We have some VERY STRONG personalities this year in our middle school group. I teach specials so I have a mix of kids from the ages of 11 (very young 6th graders) to 15 (9th grade). We are a very small group, even smaller this year due to families opting out for covid (didn't want to force their kids to wear masks).

As you can see from that last statement, I teach in a very conservative district. Not just conservative, but also very religious.

This year I had a couple students get very into LGBTQ+ rights, one came out as non-binary, the other as gay. I also have an third student who is openly trans.

To say this has caused a disruption to learning is an understatement.

I, along with the rest of my staff and admin, lean towards the more progressive and liberal side of things. We welcome out LGBTQ+ students and want to make sure they are not being harassed.

However, they've been VERY antagonistic and very forward about bringing attention to their lifestyles.

For example, they will out loud stop my class to make an announcement about what pronouns they use. I am fine with them asking peers during lunch or break to use their pronouns, but disrupting work time in class is not acceptable.

During class discussion, they will find ways to make things about being gay. Whether it's a clip art of two men on a worksheet, or just loudly conversing so the class can hear about their tastes, such as gay music or gay characters.

This gets the other students riled up. To the point where a debate on religion breaks out in class as the conservative kids break out the ""well God made you a GIRL therefore you are a GIRL."" Or the old classic, ""being gay is a sin.""

I am trying to keep peace. We've talked about respecting intellectual boundaries, we've discussed empathy, and respect.

Yet they just can't help but bring shit up that they know will get the other kids going. 

I've discussed it with their mom, who says she will not ask her kids to not be gay at school. When I tried to explain that is not the issue, the issue is they bring up sexuality in class and it causes arguments and disruption, she says it's their right to discuss whatever they want. For example, if they can't discuss boyfriends/girlfriends, then straight students shouldn't be able to either (the fact is, my cis-het students DON'T ever talk about this kind of stuff, because they are so sheltered). 

However, I also feel it is the rights of the other students to not have to constantly be barraged by the LGBTQ students. (In all fairness, I also shut down conversations of murder, weapons, drugs, etc. I also cut off any arguments on politics or mask wearing, as these turn into heated debates)

Mom wants us to use their pronouns more often, because as her child said, the other students are not using their new pronouns. I DO use the pronouns asked in front of other students, however, I don't know if legally I can force the other students to use them as well? Because doesn't that go against their beliefs?

I really feel that I am stuck between a rock and a hard place.

I just want everyone to get along, or agree to disagree, and show each other respect.

It's gotten to the point where the conservative families are pulling their kids out of our program because they don't want them learning about sexuality and gender at school. I know this is incredibly closed minded way of thinking on their part, but I feel for these kids, because it's not their fault they were raised so sheltered.

While at the same time, I want to create a safe space for my LGBTQ+ students, where they can be themselves.


Any advice is appreciated. Tomorrow my admin asked that we go over respect with all classes. I just don't know if a ""respect each other"" lesson is going to be enough at this point."

Now, I was exposed to a student who was not wearing a mask because they were eating but because I was wearing a mask all the sudden it’s completely fine and I don’t need to quarantine at all. 

I have a sneaking suspicion it’s because we are nearly out of subs and they don’t want to give us the FFCRA anymore. 

Each day I feel more and more at risk because of the numbers of kids getting COVID. This week alone in our school of 1200, 21 kids got it. We are over 120 wince returning from winter break. Obviously something isn’t working!!"

I just found out today due to scheduling shenanigans that I'm supposed to be presenting the above topic to the area on Wednesday and frankly I'm being eaten alive by this school year (full virtual). Creating presentations, materials, and checking for two different subjects and four classes is not fun = \_ =

**The post**: I'll start researching later since I still have classes and other things to do, but I was curious  about asking the teachers here about what personal experiences they have with teaching writing in a virtual set up. I'd like to clarify that I'm teaching Grade 11 and 12 students, so I'm looking for teachers who are teaching high school at the moment. Primarily targeted to English teachers but I'm also really curious to hear of other subjects that also require writing.

Apologies if there's something wrong with the grammar above as I didn't really proofread. I will appreciate every helpful response I get on this because I still have so much to do and cramming a powerpoint is really going to eat into my time ;; Thank you!"

Teacher's spouse here. I'm just wondering if anyone has advice about how they have worked out balancing their career with the career of their non-teachher spouse.

As a teacher, there is a definitive narrow hiring season of only a few months. Many non-teaching careers require that you move around geographically from time to time to advance. The larger part of the professional world does not observe the restrictive hiring cycle that teachers must follow and living that way (especially in geographically spread out areas) means stifling your own (non-teacher) career.

Just wondering how you have worked this out with your partner's."

Join us this Friday at Sunset (in solidarity) and take a 24 hour break from the hustle and bustle of technology. You deserve it. With love - from OfflineDay"	"Dear r/teaching

It's really hard to draw tech boundaries.Now with the pandemic, we are communicating that extra amount online for work, with family and friends and even relaxing online looking at screens. I'm sure that nobody is a stranger anymore to understanding some of the impacts it can have on mind and body.

I found that taking a 24 hour break, once a month, from Friday evening until Saturday evening (yes, just like shabbat)  makes a big enough difference, yet doesn't  interfere with my professional life all too much. It definitely made me feel refreshed, energised and I always ended up doing things that felt more meaningful, like learning an instrument, reading books that I never got to reading, spending time with loved ones, or being in nature.

The other thing is that I noticed it effected other aspects of my relationship with habits to the screen in the long run, in that I stopped looking at my phone before going to bed, was more conscious of the phone and how it was impacting my daily life etc. Taking that break heightened my sensitivity to knowing the difference it makes. It really makes a difference.

So, here I am, offering some of my time online to raise awareness that it can really make a difference to take a break like this. I started r/OfflineDay as a place for resources in sharing info about best practices or so that we an answer any questions you have if you'd like to try.

This Friday at Sunset, 24 hours- around the world. Enjoy!"
Spirited-Lychee	2021-02-02 09:44:16+00:00	In my senior year practicum and I just don’t feel passionate about this. I’m not enjoying this and I just need advice	"Hi, I have always wanted to be a teacher. I used to be so passionate about teaching, having my own classroom, empowering students, etc. but when junior year of college started I lost all interest. I considered changing my major but it was too late so I stuck with it. My family advised me to stick with it and finish. So I did that. I graduate in May, but I am not particularly enjoying my practicum. I am an elementary education major. I know being virtual is not ideal but I felt this way even before we went virtual. Teaching kids is very hard work. It takes patience and a special person and sometimes I feel that I am not that. The work does not seem intellectually stimulating sometimes. I just feel like such a fake, like someone better than me could do this job. As of right now I am hoping that I will somehow regain my love for teaching and will end up loving it. 

I am not enjoying my coursework. Instead of doing the work, I research other career options. I know it sounds really bad. I avoid waking up for my placements sometimes because I’d rather be sleeping. I clearly do have mental health problems that I need to sort out. It’s been hard to get out of bed. I get jealous of my classmates that are clearly so passionate about being teachers. I wish I could be like them. 

I have been searching for other career paths but I don’t know what fits me. I’ve looked into nursing, social work, counseling, even computer science. I just feel like I’m not that great with people. Nothing seems right. 

Sorry to be depressing. I like the idea of creating interesting lessons and things and I do enjoy my courses sometimes when we talk about how to teach and the activities. But the thought of doing this job in the future isn’t bringing me much joy. Kids deserve teachers who feel ecstatic about their jobs."

In terms of teaching in my career, I have disagreed with parents.

Other staff.

Other teachers.

Admin.

And yet, we have always come to an amicable conclusion that satisfies both parties.

But this year, there was a new challenger. One of my students has been coming to school lately with his homework less than half filled out. When asked why this was, he told me that it was because his home tutor teaches him and his 2 siblings at once. The home tutor doesn't let anyone see their in-class book to check for answers.

what?

The student explained that the tutor at home does the homework and reviews with the student, but expects the student to memorise and remember the work from class that we have done. So after one class, the student is expected to fully remember the work.

The tutor claims that it would be ""cheating"" to look back at the class book to find the answers.

I told the student that it is fine in my class to use the in-class book. I also wrote a note to the tutor explaining that the in-class book is crucial for their learning.

The tutor has not yet responded and my student is still coming with his homework half completed.

Am I in the wrong here? Information literacy and the ability to look up information is crucial and is an excellent 21st century skill. For context, I teach ESL/EAL."

I use excel for keeping hold of grades before they are released to the parents. I know basic functions and conditional formatting, but maybe this is a good option if I am missing something.

wanderer_0z4	2021-02-01 12:55:53+00:00	Teaching someone a language without being able to speak their native language	"This might seem more like a rant, but I really need an advice. 

 I've been teaching English (online) for around 6 months. My students are Japanese, but I can speak Japanese so I was able to explain things without any issues. A week ago, however, my boss asked me to teach both English and Japanese to one Chinese student. He can't understand English at all and is able to speak Japanese just a little bit (he can read katakana and hiragana, and knows some common phrases but we can't communicate). Personally, I don't think it's a good idea to start two different languages from the scratch at the same time (he will have two classes a week, one English and one Japanese class), but they both believe it won't be a problem.

So far, I had only one English class with him last Friday. For the beginning, I tried teaching him how to introduce himself, taught him some useful phrases that he should use during classes (""Please repeat"", ""Please speak slowly"" etc) and practiced pronouncing some words with him. It was really more like a class to get to know him and estimate his language skills. 

He, however, kept asking a lot of questions during the class using google translate. Sometimes the machine translation was such that I wasn't able to easily understand what he meant. And sometimes he would stop me to ask something that I was just about to explain. When I tried to move on with my explanation and showed pictures and repeated it so he could easily understand even if I said it in English, he wouldn't really listen and instead repeatedly showed his translated question. Just random example to explain it; if I explained him what ""a man"" means, he would stop me and type in translator ""how do you say a woman?"" and when I said ""a woman"", he would still point to google translate on his phone for me to type it too. Sometimes I would just send him a picture and type ""woman"" in our chat, and he would then understand that I'm answering his question. Other times he wouldn't budge. Not to mention that I was feeling a little bit troubled for being stopped because if I've just told him how to pronounce ""a man"", it's only natural (is it not?) that I'll teach him how to say ""a woman"" next. He also stopped to ask me if ""a man"" can mean ""two or more people"", and I've explained that it's only singular, but also added that I will explain plural and singular nouns during some of our next classes. If Chinese is any similar to Japanese, then it lacks plurals in the normal English sense and it really deserves its separate class for him to learn how to properly use it. He would still, however, stop me and ask further questions regarding some other grammar, and in order to answer it, I had to use English to Chinese translator as well (he can't understand me at all when I speak English). 

I do usually appreciate when students show interest and ask a lot of questions, but it's really difficult to just skip to explain to someone how to say ""I am taller than you"", when they still don't even understand what ""I am a student"" means or even how to use a verb to be. It was all around the place and I think it was difficult for the both of us. I also don't think I could teach him anything if we need to keep using google translator, which he insists on. I did prepare a class that I thought was easy to understand for a beginner, and I used a lot of photos and was mimicking gestures. 

From what I could see, his English skills are really low. The most of the students I've taught knew to say some stuff, like ""a man"", ""a woman"", ""a table"", but it seemed he heard these for the first time. I planned to start with the verb to be on our next class, but my boss told me (he can speak Chinese) that this student requested lessons for more advanced English after our first one.

I am obviously failing at this badly, and I'm not sure about how to approach it. If he requested more advanced lessons, than maybe he understood more than I thought he did. It is easier to estimate how much the student knows and to explain things when I am able to speak their native language. I am also very against communicating via google translator during the class. The translations aren't accurate, it takes too much time to type and communicate that way, and I really tried to make the class as simple as possible for him to be able to understand, but I might have not done it so well.  

Can you please give me some advice? I've got a Japanese lesson with him tomorrow, and I've prepared the material, but I am worried it'll go as badly as the English class. How should I teach someone a language properly without being able to speak their native language and especially without using google translator?"

I also understand that in the pandemic more students are doing less work which means my amount of time spent grading is much lower than it will normally be. Due to my situation, I wouldn't read to much into the fact that I manage to leave work on time every day without working in the evenings or on weekends. Thing is, my wife who is an elementary teacher with 5 preps has worked the same rate the last 5 years. I also have colleagues with a fuller work load that manage to keep their hours ~40 per week.

This is such a huge contrast to the types of discussions I see teachers having online I routinely see teachers complaining about 60 plus hour weeks, teachers saying that they work in the summer (what, why???). So what gives? Why do some teachers have these miserable long work weeks, while others manage to get the job done as a regular 9-5? 

Is it that some teachers are better working smarter than harder?

Is it the different expectations of teachers by state?

is it just teachers getting tired of people constantly saying things like ""oh you're so lucky  you get so much time off, you hardly even have to work throughout the year"". They want to be appreciated so they exaggerate how much time they work each year?

I'm genuinely just trying to figure out why there seems to be such an insane variance on how much teachers across the country are working."

I’m a pre-service teacher.  I’m writing a unit plan for 16 English lessons as one of my assignments.

I’m getting stuck because I’ve never worked in a mainstream Year 3 classroom.  I don’t know kids’ attention spans and the kinds of activities that would be best suited to them.

I’ve got some cool, (hopefully) age-appropriate texts and videos I can use to explain the concept.  I’ve downloaded some sample unit plans and lesson plans to give me guidance.  I’ve got access to a bunch of textbooks to help with the theory side of things.  I’ve got some example work samples from the Department of Education’s website so I can see what standard of work to expect from a typically developing 8-year-old.  

Still, it’s very hard to visualise exactly what a lesson might look like when I haven’t yet entered a mainstream classroom.  I’d love some more concrete guidance on how to approach actual lesson structure.  Would 20 minutes of class discussion and then 30 minutes of group-work be appropriate?  How much independent writing do year 3s do?  These kinds of things are sticking points for me.  

I know these questions are very basic, but any more concrete advice at all on what a typical Year 3 English lesson might look like would be such a huge help.  

Thanks in advance.  :)"

Ohwhatabeautifulview	2021-01-30 18:45:28+00:00	Experiences with difficult admin?	"Hey all,

First-time post for me here. I've always had really positive relationships with my principals in my career. Sure, there have been many duds along the way but none of them ever had a personal problem with me and generally knew I was good at my job and trusted me. I am super passionate about teaching and do a lot of PD, re-invent my program constantly and take a strong passion for equity and a variety of global issues that weave their way into my program. 

Enough about me though, what I want to talk about is difficult administrators. Have any of you had an experience with an admin where they made assumptions about you and/or picked on you constantly? We recently got a new principal and this person seems to have come into our school ""guns a blazing"" so to speak, peeing all over everything in sight (metaphorically) to assert their dominance over staff. Every time an issue is brought up, they are quick to turn it onto me and ask me what I've done, why I haven't done enough, etc. when I feel personally that I only speak up when I am at the end of my rope and cannot manage with whatever the situation is. I feel in these situations I've done enough to support that student. I've also heard through the grapevine that this admin has made very unfair assumptions about me as a person when they literally do not know me, have never even watched me teach. It almost feels like this person is threatened and any time they feel like anyone knows MORE than they do about a situation (which we all know more than this person does right now about our students, as they just started at our school), they turn it around and claim that the teacher is stupid, unqualified to be speaking. 

I'm super concerned about how to move forward with this person. I don't want to have a bad relationship or years of battling with them ahead but I also won't tolerate being belittled. I don't know how to get through years with a boss that straight up doesn't like me for no reason? I'm used to having good relationships with my admin. If you've had experience with this before, are there any strategies or things you did to get through it? 

&amp;#x200B;

TY in advance!"
Healingbyhikin	2021-01-30 18:30:15+00:00	Teaching in urban areas and white savior complex	"Hello fellow educators , this post will be about some social and political issues and if you are uncomfortable with conversations about race keep scrolling. If you are offended by what I say I am so sorry and please send me a private message so we can hash it out. I am only writing from my own experience and limited knowledge! 

I’ve been really struggling with feeling like a “white savior” lately. My current position is working with Baltimore’s vulnerable youth and the majority of our students are black. I struggle because as a staff there is only about 20% people of color, and maybe 2% of us are from Baltimore if any? I want to help these students so bad, I love them, I believe in them. But sometimes I feel so out of my element, which is often good but also who am I as a white woman to tell these kids how to act. I don’t know what a day in their community looks like. I don’t what it feels like to grow up poor and black in Baltimore. I’m trying to educate myself, read books, but I still can’t shake the feeling that this program would be more beneficial coming from the students community members. We’re funded by John Hopkins university and I wonder why John Hopkins Is funding An outdoor school in Northeast  and not schools and organizations in Baltimore city run by people from Baltimore. 

In my elementary school I remember taking a reading level test on the computer and I had a 12th grade reading level in like 5th grade. Many of current students read at a second grade level or lower. I sat with an extremely intelligent student who still struggled with reading words like cake and cause. She did really well when I patiently sat with her and it was soon apparent she was dyslexic. Are you getting help for this in school I asked? “Well they just put me in a special ed class” another student I was helping (6th grade) was struggling with fractions and when I drew out a number line for her it seemed as though she had never seen fractions before or never had someone make her accountable for really looking at them. I am blown away by how much Baltimore schools are struggling. How high the turn over rate is in teachers, how much the students seem to be just passed along, the lack of support these students have the lack of support these teachers have. I am reminded of my privilege on a daily basis. 

I recently interviewed for teach for America and the last question was how will you contribute to ending racial inequality in schools across America. Wow. How will I as a single white woman end racial inequality in schools when our societies are so deeply flawed. I struggled with this question. I spoke in circles for awhile mostly talking about how I would provide an equal education for all of my students in my classroom. how I would meet them where they’re at, not let them fall behind, make sure they believed in themselves. I would make damned sure these kids knew how to read and I would be asking everyday to make sure their hierarchy or needs were being met. That they felt safe that they weren’t hungry. Later I wonder if should have said I would learn from the educators of color around me. That I would ask them how to best use my privilege to help these students. To ask them what they need from me. I need more resources more training more of a look into the communities that my students grow up in. Or maybe that I would advocate for my students of color to later become teachers to represent their communities. 79% of teachers in this country are white that’s a big problem. A huge problem. 

I don’t want to be a savior but I want love and support my students who need it most to the best of my ability. I am learning. I would love any insight."

I’m a freelance drama teacher for an after school club and with COVID-19 we’ve reduced our classes massively since last March resulting in tons of furloughs and online classes. Today, I got to cover one of our few in person classes and being here just reminds me so much of why I became a teacher in the first place. 

I love the energy of the kids, being able to connect with them and see their faces (even with the masks!) and just feel the joy that they get from being able to engage with each other and our material is just - ahhhhhhh! It’s so good! They’re smiling and laughing and just being kids. I can’t wait for life to return to some sort of regular. 

I want to go back to regular classes! I love my job! Today I remember why I’m here and why I always come back. 

Also just as a note, not in the US!"

&amp;#x200B;

New teacher here, first year, \*\*zero experience\*\* (I wasn't an education major or minor, so no student teacher experience) - ELA/11th &amp; 12th. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year is immensely crazy but I've managed to bond with my kids and I've gotten a lot of feedback when it comes from them saying how they enjoy my class, like that I check up on them, etc. However, I feel that when it comes to my actual lessons...I'm a bit of a mess. I wasn't given a mentor (I'm an interim teacher, so we don't get a mentor teacher in my district), and I've been winging it. But...differentiated instruction, scaffolding, chunking...I know these are basic things but I've only taken  one education course as an elective. I simply just go through the novels/plays, kahoot, quiz/exam, and even go over things I feel juniors &amp; seniors should be prepared for when it comes to the ""real world"" (once every two weeks I have a special ""college &amp; career prep"" unit where there's a new topic such as interviews, student loans, college/majors, resumes, e-mail, cover letters, etc.) along with the topic they're supposed to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone in my school says that I'm doing a kickass job but...I'm a bit concerned that I don't properly know how to set up a unit. While these kids like me and they're doing a great job, I'm concerned that I'm not teaching them correctly. I feel I could be doing more and I don't feel I'm being effective. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I'm an interim ELA high school teacher in his first year. They threw me to the wolves and while I'm kicking ass, deep down I feel I'm winging it and not doing these kids any favors. Thoughts?"
gerbering	2021-01-30 00:44:25+00:00	Stop being lazy!!!	"Uggghh. I gave a quiz this week. I teach Algebra at a high school that is hybrid for the time being.

Some students didn’t do their classwork until after the quiz because they realized eligibility check for athletics was this Friday. “Why did I do so bad on the quiz??” Well you didn’t learn the material, at all!

Others complain that they don’t know how to do the classwork and it’s too hard. These are the same students who skip class all the time.

We spent the whole class period today reviewing for a test next time. Five kids started yelling at me because we had a quiz this week!! This is school! What did you think we were gonna do?? Yes, we are going to have tests and quizzes! 

Kids complain that they didn’t know how to do the problems. I ask them where their notes are. “I don’t take notes.” Uh huh. 

I’m pretty sure most students are going to fail the test.   Nearly half failed the quiz, despite me providing instructional videos outside of class and going over the exact type of problems (read: just replaced the freaking numbers with other numbers) in class.

Someone please give me some kind of comfort or inclination that I’m not alone before I smash my head into the wall."
lukef31	2021-01-30 00:06:54+00:00	Advice needed	"For some background, I'm an elementary teacher with a class with several (about 5) class clowns.

Last year I sought advice on dealing with classroom management. I've found several ways since then to keep it under control. However, I have one student in particular (we'll call him student A) who is constantly disrupting class. He gets upset because of some sort of negative consequence, and he just loses it. He'll yell over me while teaching, leaves his desk to go mess with another kid, and calls out constantly.  He's gone to admin several times and even received in-school suspension. I have reason to believe, that I'm not going to elaborate on here, that home life isn't great.

Admin pulled him out the other day, and he says he's just trying to be funny like student B and student C, but no one ever laughs at his jokes. 

What is some advice you can give me for dealing with this student?"
MystaED	2021-01-29 22:40:47+00:00	Any games that can be played for small online classes?	"I often have this ""extracurricular"" class with a couple of students who are smart but relatively lazy. I figure maybe I could use the time to help them learn in a fun way. Does anyone have any games I could play? I was using Jeopardy to reinforce vocab and literary elements, which is good, but it's become a bit repetitive for them and it takes a while to write out all the slides etc. The class is online so nothing tactile would work. And although I have a lot of flexibility, they do have to be learning-based. The students are in 7th grade (but on a 9th-grade level). Every time I look for games online I get elementary based games or Jeopardy, but there must be something else.  Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated."
Xoxo_Idjey	2021-01-29 21:51:35+00:00	Why did I become a teacher?	"I am a fifth grade teacher and it’s my first year with my own classroom. I am also the only fifth grade teacher. My mentor has never taught fifth grade and always tells me she is sorry she can’t help me. There are 2 other schools in my district, both with 4-5 fifth grade teachers in them but I have zero help with planning and materials. We have been hybrid since the beginning of the year, which is super challenging. I have 26 students total, with 10 in class everyday and 10 online. The other 6 just come to school when they want to, and go on zoom when they want to with zero notice or notifications. 

Annoyance 1: Yesterday my secretary(who is working from home), emailed me about my new student. She included that she hoped she wasn’t the first to tell me(she was), but she had zero info. She told me my principal would be in contact, I receive his information today at 4:30 PM. It’s Friday, he starts fucking Monday. He has a behavior plan, but I haven’t seen it. He has violent behaviors is all I was told. 

Annoyance 2: We had parent teacher conferences scheduled for one and a half days this week, so no students. The other elementary schools only had half a day for conferences and then were able to have second day off. We were then told on the half day that if we scheduled any conferences for after school hours throughout the week, we could have off Friday. Obviously since none of us knew this, we couldn’t have off. 

Annoyance 3: So, since the other schools had off I asked if we were allowed to work from home. We would be on zoom all day anyway, there was no need to be in building. I was told we were only allowed to do conferences at home if they were after school hours. Then, I received an email from my boss saying she would be working from home that day. 

Annoyance 4: we all worked our contracted day (8-3:30), and were told at 3:15 we could leave after working 6 hours! So, we could have left at 2:00. Fuck my district"

chipotle-lover	2021-01-29 08:57:24+00:00	Trouble Getting Kids Motivated	"Sorry for the bad formatting, I am posting through a mobile device.

I have been providing orchestral lessons to kids for the past few years; however, due to COVID, I found there to be a huge disconnect between myself and the students, and it is something I am struggling with. I always try to make our lessons something to look forward to, not dread, and be as helpful as possible by suiting their personal learning styles. Now, I struggle to create fun activities to hook their interest and the kids seem unexcited for yet another day of playing a foreign instrument. I always try to put the kids’ needs before mine (of course); however, I can’t help but feel disheartened at the end of the day because I feel as though I am letting them down.

An example of this is how a student I work with is a visual learner, from what they have told me when I asked, so I have been filming videos of me playing through the music, creating worksheets/guides, and attaching helpful YouTube video links; however, the student does not seem invested in the instrument, and often does not practice. 

What are some ways you all got your students excited to learn remotely? If there are any music teachers on here, how have you been able to tackle the struggle of introducing an instrument to a youth without being able to guide them firsthand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I understand that 9% of my salary is taken for the pension system through TRS, but I don’t understand the logistics of our pension system... 

Building off of that, should I be fearful for what my pension will be in the future? I feel like I see so many articles discussing how the pension system is flawed and is unsustainable. Maybe I should invest more in my 403b and set up a Roth?

reed12321	2021-01-29 00:16:58+00:00	Today was a bad day	"I’m a special ed teacher, and a pretty heartbreaking thing that a mom said to me once was, “When my son comes home, and I see that he drew all over his pants, I ask him, ‘How was your day?’ and he always responds, ‘Today was a bad day.’” 

That student of mine was in 8th grade, had an autism and ADHD diagnosis, and thus had a pretty rough go of middle school. 

While I will never ever equate myself and my struggles to those with disabilities, I have a newfound understanding of what he meant when he said, “Today was a bad day.” 

Covid has finally taken grip and its toll on me emotionally and spiritually. At the beginning of quarantine, I was actually excited. I felt liberated knowing that performance was no longer being observed and that my primary job was to connect with  my kids. I made fun, interactive online videos for my middle school kids showing them how to bake some cookies while messing up the recipe, and building a planter box. I taught them what I thought was some valuable life lessons and was excited to know that I got to forge my own path and bring my students along for a little bit. 

Then school started up as hybrid in the fall, and everything still felt like it had a positive tint to it while masking the doom and gloom that hid behind unsuspecting masks. Responsibility after responsibility piled on top of each other. Scheduling IEP meetings so we can play catch-up for those we missed in the spring, creating temporary programming solutions for students and families who chose to keep their children home full time, crating temporary programming solutions for families that chose to allow their students to engage in the hybrid model, rearranging staff coverage every time someone had an exposure and needed to quarantine, rearranging long-term staff coverage every time someone that worked with my students tested positive, juggling hybrid classes where students were home and in school at the same time, writing new IEPs, scheduling zoom meetings for everything, grading assignments, adding progress marks on IEP goals/objectives, creating lesson plans, and attending staff meetings that were veiled as a positive “pep rally” while slyly adding more responsibilities. This is not sustainable. 

Today I realized I missed an important deadline. The deadline should have been today and this is the first time in my 7 years as a teacher that I missed something like this. I’m not even the only SPED teacher this month that has missed this. My district and my coworkers are not slackers, or negligent what so ever. The responsibilities that teachers are dealing with are infinitely more than a normal school year, which is still infinitely more than what we should have to deal with. As I said, this is not sustainable. I can’t handle having a near-panic attack on an almost daily basis thinking I missed submitting something that seems like a waste of my time. However, what I missed today was a big deal. 

I called my boss today and thankfully I was able to finagle this situation in a more favorable way, but this is still not a good look. I don’t feel good about this. I feel like a failure because I’m doing everything I can while juggling so many other things. I literally can’t do any more of the things that my district wants us to do. 

I feel like a failure. Today was a bad day. And what you can’t see is that my pants are now totally black with all of the pen I wish I could have drawn all over them."

"Your grandson is not failing because he isn’t scoring high enough on tests (not that those are wonderful either, but they’re not abysmal), he’s failing because he can’t be arsed to turn in work even when he’s reminded of it through constant progress reports, verbal reminders from me, and messages on google classroom.

He is missing ONE HUNDRED POINTS worth of work. To add insult to injury, I literally uploaded the keys for this work once we finished it. He could have easily copied the answers and submitted his work.

He is 15 years old and this behavior happened last year, too. It’s not because of virtual learning. It’s because of his lack of work ethic."

daedricelf	2021-01-28 15:47:07+00:00	Thoughts on student teachers and pay?	"Hi everyone - I just wanted to share a (potentially unpopular) opinion and see what thoughts everyone else has on this. This is probably mostly rant, and for that I do apologize.

For context, I'm a student teacher right now working to get my license to teach HS. Myself and a few student teachers I know put in 40+ hours a week towards our internships (grading, planning, teaching, attending meetings, all that fun stuff). We are also told to avoid working as much as possible to focus on our internships.

I completely understand how having a job is just added stress - I moved my own work schedule to work 12 hr shifts on the weekends to free up my weekdays but also pay my bills, because I'm also an adult who lives on their own. However, I do feel that if we are going to be asked to not work, we should at least recieve a stipend of some sorts.

Do we deserve full pay? Absolutely not. I am not licensed and the teacher I'm under is still carrying me through this, working just as hard (especially during COVID). I recognize and understand that I'm not a ""real"" teacher yet, so getting full pay would be absolutely ridiculous. Again, though - I am teaching, planning, supporting my kids, attending the meetings, and doing all of the teacher things, for free. I'm appreciative of the opportunity and I adore teaching, but believe student teaching being a paid internship would be fair.

(I also recognize that there's no way in Hades that a state/school/district would ever support this, but I needed to rant to someone other than my poor husband)."

It will be at least a month before I start since the background check has to clear. Is there anything you would recommend bringing my first day on the job? Or things I might be interested at some point? 

Effective classroom management strategies? When I was subbing I used the “1, 2, 3” method with the younger children. Usually worked, but I think it was also partly because they would get a lap at recess. 

There will be 1-2 teacher aides with me, 20 kids. Though because of the pandemic theyre mainly virtual right now, but anything for going back to in person would be great as well!

Sorry if the post was all over, I’m still excited that they are moving forward with the process and trying to be prepared as much as I can!"

A big part of covid19 times is that our district has managed to ensure schools have a 1:1 ratio of students to chromebooks.  The way we distribute these devices is driving me crazy, but my input on how it’s done is ignored. 

Our system is at first hour, kids unplug their devices and they tote them from class to class.  At the end of the day they return to their first hour and plug them back in.  They are not allowed to take them home.  

My life would be 1000 times easier if they took the devices home, as well as the teachers.  

I’m just curious what ways other schools handle this."

I did a couple of searches but couldn't find much. I have a question with regards to online learning. I am teaching a course (face to face - in a classroom) which will soon be delivered remotely to another city and was wondering if anyone here has any experience in setting these things up?

I'm guessing a laptop, camera &amp; stand, microphone (Wireless?), and perhaps a source of light to light up the teacher and whiteboard?

I guess the biggest challenge I see here is using myself, a whiteboard, and a powerpoint presentation all in conjunction - whilst keeping it all seamlessly working. 

With regards to the above equipment - does anyone have any recommendations for what will work well without breaking the budget?

IAmAWhitey	2021-01-26 01:16:15+00:00	"How to become a teacher of general elementary as fast as possible in California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Vegas, or New Jersey?"	"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Really appreciate whatever help can be offered and time is somewhat of the essence because I need to decide whether to follow a path I've been accepted to (don't want to talk shit on any programs that deigned to accept me so keeping it vague).

I live in Florida, just graduated from college with a BS in Psych and want to teach badly. I did an educational mentorship for over a year with a program for poor kids in trouble with the juvenile justice system to differing degrees usually multiple grade levels behind, got told to kick dust by TFA and now just super want to teach in one of these 4 states (or city) because I have family and/or friends in each of them and know I'll want at least some support. 

I've been applying to tons of things since being rejected by TFA: Master's programs in those states, CAS programs, etc. I'm just not sure which is the most ""legit""/""best use of my time and money path"". 

From people who actually live in and know what it's like in the topsy-turvy system, how should I best go about this? 

Also, I'm sure everything's crazy during COVID (I have been working in the restaurant industry since it began, it's cuckoo there), so advice or experience may not perfectly map onto the present, but any anecdotal paths or ways people wish they had done it would be beautiful. 

**TL;DR: I just really want to find out the most efficient time-wise and success-wise path to teaching in one of those general locations. Open to all teaching conditions.**"

I have 15 units and work in early childhood now. I really like it but I eventually want to go get a bachelors and teach k-5 age kids. I also have some other city college classes done. it will take me longer (at least a semester) to get a AA than to just transfer but I really like the teachers at the city college and I am not the best with longer term goals without any shorter term achievements. I'm really lucky to have parents who support my education and since most of my city college was paid for by a grant in my area I could do both financially. Would having a AA in early childhood make my resume any better after the bachelors? Should I just skip it and go though univeristy as quickly as possible? Any advice is apperciated. I am 21 years old and live in California.
capybaramelhor	2021-01-26 00:15:59+00:00	"A small, simple breakthrough with remote teaching"	"Like many of you here, here, I have been very frustrated this year. I have been remote the entire year and I teach middle school science. 

I have had many of the same struggles… Students not attending, not talking, no cameras, just a complete lack of connection. It has been very frustrating. 

I have started to do one thing recently that has seemed to help individual classes somewhat. Sometimes, when I start class with a small anecdote or a story about myself, it really increases participation and engagement throughout the class. 

For example, once a student mentioned that they were going to a surprise party for their sibling that weekend. I told them about a time (years ago) that I threw a surprise party for my husband and how his friend pretended to be locked out of the apartment. Another time I told them I stayed up way too late over the weekend and asked them to guess what I was doing (reading a book).

You can decide what kinds of stories you’re comfortable sharing! 

I know this is a really small thing, and many of you probably do it already. But I have found that it is a way to get the students to open up, laugh, participate, and has seemed to help and keep that vibe throughout most of the rest of the period. 

Let me know if you have any other small tips or wins that make remote learning better!"

ocalabull	2021-01-25 21:13:21+00:00	I’m going to vent about Teaching during covid	"I want to start by saying I have no problem teaching in person, as long is it’s done safely. 

With that, we’re also putting a ton of trust in parents and kids who a lot of times could not care less about us and our well being. 

Today, a student showed up with a doctor’s note after missing 3 of the last 4 days of school. Ok, no biggie. She said she had allergies. Fair enough. Until I started to did deeper. I asked this student if they had any other symptoms last week, and low and behold they had a fever, body aches, stomach issues, and a constant cough. She was still coughing frequently today. I asked her if she was tested for covid, and she said, very quickly, “no.”

That did not make me happy to hear in any sense so I called the school nurse and spoke with the principal as well. The local health department told us that she was in the clear because she had a doctor’s note from within the last five days, UNLESS she complains about not feeling well. So after hearing this, I mentioned to the student that I would like for her to let me know if she’s not feeling well at all today. Her response was “but my parents told me not to saying anything” and “they’ll be mad if I have to go home.”

Sure enough, an hour later she told me she was not feeling well (and it was legitimate, she looked miserable). 

The point is, there truly are people who don’t give a shit about teachers or their families. I have people that I go home to that I love very much. I don’t want them getting sick. I feel awful for the kid to have parents teaching her such shit morals. 

Rant over."

I am excited to say that I was just offered a job, but now I'm beginning to have second thoughts about it... Not only would I end up starting February 8th (in two weeks) in the middle of this school year, but the pay is barely above what I make now, and obviously with way less vacation time. I feel bad leaving my kids and the school with no one at such short notice, but is it bad to say that I also feel sad knowing I'll get less vacation time? There are a lot of great perks to this new job, and a lot of room for growth and advancement. But I have been doing nothing but teaching for the last 7 years, and something is holding me back from easily accepting the new job. I absolutely love to teach, but this is barely teaching anymore.

We have a hybrid model learning at our school. All instructions and assignments are on Canvas and we’re required to have synchronous learning twice a week. Some students are learning from home and some are sitting in my classroom on their school issued chromebooks. I teach 7th grade English. 


So, all year I have had just a few students who don’t log in or complete much work. The students who regularly log in put a decent amount of effort into their assignments. But this semester, each English teacher were forced to take in new kids because another English teacher left and her class was dissolved. I feel as though this is what sparked a lot of the issues I currently have in class. On top of that, admin randomly decided students were required to have Google folders shared with their english teachers which compiled all of their writing assignments. So in essence, they have to go back and forth between google drive and Canvas to do work. 😐


Last Thursday, I assigned them an essay. We’ve done 5+ essays in my class over the last semester, and they did decently. This time, I only gave them 1 day to plan and 1 day to write their rough draft in prep for an upcoming benchmark. Only 1/4 of my students actually submitted the rough draft. Another 1/4 told me they’re still struggling with the rough draft (this is not day 3 of the essay), and the rest of the students have not even began it. On top of that, only half my students created and shared a Google folder with me, and only a few of those students are actually putting their writing in that folder. AND the at-home students have been impossible to reach, as they refuse to answer my Teams calls. With the in-person learners, some refuse to do their work as well and calling home to parents after several warnings has not been effective. 


Of the few drafts that I have been able to ready, I am appalled at their writing, especially the new students. I cannot understand how a student has made it to 7th grade without being able to write a complete simple sentence.  These students aren’t even ESL or LEP. They are actually incapable of forming a thought in a complete sentence and putting that down on paper or a google document. They don’t know what paragraphs are......


I have no idea what to do. I am a first year teacher. I feel so stressed that none of the kids are doing their work and worried about the new generation... I am especially frustrated with the students who are not new to my class and who have done well before but now are suddenly saying they don’t know how to write an essay. 😭"

gauchelygraceful	2021-01-24 17:24:10+00:00	Advice for teaching young children who have difficulties concentrating	"Hey all! I am currently tutoring a 4-year-old girl in my building and helping her learn to read and write. She's a very sweet kid and has lots of energy and imagination (she loves telling stories and drawing). However, I have difficulty making her concentrate on one task at once, especially when it involves reading or writing. Sometimes, I'm able to get her excited about learning, but after a few minutes, she quickly gets bored and wants to do something else. I've tried to orient lessons towards her preferences (e.g. writing letters/words on cards and hiding them around the house in a treasure hunt style, writing words down and having her read and then draw the word), and I try to kind of go with the flow so she doesn't feel like I'm forcing her to sit down and study for an hour straight, because that seems unrealistic for a 4-year-old (i.e. if she says she's bored of an activity, I ask her what I can do to make it less boring, or if she says she wants a break to play hide-and-seek, I play with her before turning back to reading/writing). While these strategies sometimes works for a short while, it's hard to get her to focus on reading/writing in the long run. I am also afraid that by making my lessons so play-oriented, I'm kind of indulging her lack of concentration.

I'm going to be an elementary school teacher next school year, so I consider this practice in taking students' needs and interests into account when helping them learn. While I love spending time with her and I feel like she *is* learning to read and write new words to a certain extent, I also feel somewhat discouraged at the fact that I'm unable to get her interested in reading/writing for a prolonged period of time.

Does anyone have any advice on how to get her more interested in reading/writing, or on how to manage children in general who quickly get bored of tasks/lessons? What can I do to help her become more engaged while not encouraging her to view reading/writing as a chore?

Thank you so much!"
slk_thor9	2021-01-24 16:55:11+00:00	Teacher prep programs - useful?	"**TL;DR Is it common to hate teacher prep programs and feel like it isn't actually preparing you for real-life teaching?**

I'm currently enrolled in a Master of Arts in teaching program. I have never felt less engaged or unstimulated while learning than I do now. I already have a graduate degree and two undergrad degrees, so it's not that I hate school or don't enjoy learning. **Is this common?**

Granted, it may be because I'm in a fully online program (WGU). BUT, I've taken numerous other online courses and I felt engaged and eager to learn, so I don't think it's the solitary aspect.

I find it ironic that we're learning about different learning theories, teaching strategies, and assessment methods, but we're taught via **one** strategy (basically a shit ton of reading supplemented by a few YouTube videos) and assessed via **one** method (papers or summative exams at the end of the course). So basically we're expected to memorize and regurgitate, which I think we can all agree is about as boring and meaningless as it gets.

I thought this program would be a good fit for me because I work full time, it's affordable, and got good reviews when I researched it. However, I'm starting to think that maybe 1) this program just isn't for me, 2) maybe teaching isn't for me, or 3) I just have pursued an alternative path to licensing. I'm hoping I didn't waste my money."

I figure it is pretty normal if there isn't an opening with your exact area of study, they can try to stick you with something similar e.g. Biology or Physics rather than Space science.. how often does this occur?

The teacher I am replacing left without any notice due to a family emergency. The school gave me 2 days of training that really only covered stuff about the general school rules, benefits, stuff like that. 

They threw me into the classroom without any lesson plans whatsoever. They couldn’t even tell me where the students left off. I had to go through each topic and standard with my classes to see what they remembered learning. 

The school said they don’t have any lesson plans literally at all for my class because the teacher had her chalk account removed, which is where her lesson plans were. I am also the only science teacher for this grade. There’s no grade above me and the science teacher in the grade below me quit as well. All I have pretty much is a list of standards. 

I have friends who started teaching midway through the year and they all have partner teachers that give them lessons plans and help.  My coworkers are super nice and helpful, but they can only do so much on top of their own work, especially when they’ve never taught science and don’t have any plans either. 

Is this normal? To throw a brand new teacher in halfway through a year with zero experience or plan for them? They knew I didn’t have experience from the interview and my application and assured me that it would be ok. I don’t know what to do. They want two weeks of plans for 2 different classes by Monday.

Aiel_Aviendha	2021-01-22 23:03:14+00:00	Admin shut down the Toilet Times	"A couple of faculty members (myself included, so I may be biased...) created the Toilet Times, a single sheet of fun taped to the inside of the faculty bathroom stalls. It included a fun fact, mind bender, questions about faculty (voluntarily given), jokes, a poem, and other little tidbits (short story, matching game, short news articles, etc.). We kept ourselves anonymous to add to the fun. 

We included an email for people to make contributions...and they’d been biting! Sending in their own thoughts/work to be displayed.

We made sure there was no profanity, slurs, nothing of that kind. Kept it G rated. 

But today admin emailed telling us to take it down because it was offensive... am I wrong to be a bit miffed? We just wanted to give people something to smile about—especially this year"
Matter_After	2021-01-22 19:41:34+00:00	Will misdemeanor charges affect getting a job?	"So I recently decided I want to switch majors from a business admin to a teaching degree. I would be completing the teaching bachelor's in about a year, then a master's degree. The reason I'm making this post is that two and a half years ago when I was in college I got charged with underage possession of alcohol twice and public intox twice. Obviously not all at the same time but within a couple of weeks. One possession and one public intox were dismissed/deferred disposition. So I have two guilty misdemeanors now. Like I said that was all two and a half years ago and I've grown up a ton since then. I am 23 now. By the time I finish my degree and actually start applying for jobs the charges will be about 4 years old. How will this affect me seeking employment in teaching? Thank you in advance!!! (PS I want to do secondary education if that makes a difference)"
GallhadtheGreat123	2021-01-22 19:37:39+00:00	Advice?	"I recently considered becoming a high school history teacher for my career. It had been something in the back of my mind for years, and I'm 90% sure it is what I want to do now. However, I've heard it is very difficult to get a job as such. My plans are very loose and subject to change, but just wanted to ask about things I should keep in mind going forward.

Now me personally, I am coming from a well-off background so money isn't really an issue for me. I've also very strongly thought about teaching in inner-city public schools.

So I wanted to ask veteran teachers, what would help me land a job? I assume a willingness to teach at multiple grades, schools, and subjects would help. Would experience teaching in less competitive positions for a while help if I wanted to land a more specific position that I'd prefer to teach later on? Are positions easier to find at public schools in the inner-city?

Also considering a special ed job as well, and wondering if that is also in high demand and if there is any advice that teachers have in preparing myself for it (what classes I should take to educate myself, what to expect, etc.).

(I feel like this comes off as cynical and very ""white savior""-like, but I'm basically just asking as someone who wants to be a public servant and how I could both serve communities in the ways most needed, while also feeling satisfied personally.)"

Okay, follow my logic here. I'm Canadian with an American certification in teaching. I would love to do a Masters in Education or Masters in teaching to boost my job prospects. I currently live in South Korea. 

I know that a lot of universities are online this year due to Coronavirus. I'd love to do a degree online that doesn't say online on it (if that makes sense) as it seems that all in-person universities are online.

At the bottom of this post are some masters programs I was considering. But, they are online and the degree says online. What program would you guys recommend that doesn't say online on it. Like a program that should be done in person, but due to coronavirus, is online. 

My long-term goals are to continue teaching abroad. I don't have any possibility of going back to Canada. That's why I included the IB program in my search below.

eacks29	2021-01-22 06:20:49+00:00	how can I get a teaching job in a good district?	"hi all, so I currently teach 3rd grade at a charter school and the situation is less than ideal and is becoming unbearable. I don’t even have a classroom and have to teach in the cafeteria, meanwhile still prepping the kids for the state test teaching hybrid during covid.

anyway, the only reason I’m still at this school is because I’ve applied for dozens of other teaching jobs in my area in every district around me and have had no luck getting a new job. I’ve had a couple of interviews, each with hundreds of applicants. I’m beginning to feel hopeless, and have no idea how I’m supposed to stand out in that large of an applicant pool with so few positions opening up.

is there anything I can do to make myself more marketable (I already have my reading endorsement and a PK-3 license)? I’ve been teaching for 3 years, 2 of those in kindergarten, and I was a daycare teacher for 1.5 years before that. What specific positions are school districts looking to hire most? At this point I’m considering going back to school to do special ed, TESOL, or counseling. Do I just need more experience? Help! Thank you!"
ThatBoy0718	2021-01-22 02:41:34+00:00	I love my kids😊	I am a special education resource teacher. Today I popped into one of my student’s 2nd grade classroom. The students were working on an MLK activity and were considering how impactful his actions were on the world. I told the class that they are the change in the world. One student asked “what are you going to do?” I responded by saying “I am going to help you get there!” She had the biggest smile on her face.  Made my whole week.
Dobbys_Other_Sock	2021-01-22 00:42:20+00:00	Why do I even bother talking?	"Today I hit a mental wall. I teach high school ELA for Freshman and Seniors. My freshman seem to believe that doing work is optional? It’s been a problem the whole year but the last few weeks it’s gotten significantly worse. 

Today was a practice day for the writing section of their end of the year testing. We’ve done it a few other times during the year and they’ve all taken the actual test several times so it’s nothing new to them. Three sources and a prompt question, write an essay. I talk them through the prompt, what it’s asking, and what they need to include. I give them 10 minutes then start circling the room. I approach students they seem to be doing nothing (usually on their phones) to get them focused on the work. 

Student: “we’re supposed to be doing something?” 

Me: “Yes (explains whole assignment again and help them find it on classroom) start working and I’ll come back to check on you” Have this conversation about 15 more times. 

I look around a see at least 3 kids don’t even have computers open any more. I approach those students.

Student: I’m gonna work on it later at home. 

Me: “this needs to be done during class today so you need to work on it now.” 

Repeat 4 times, 7 students are now not working, two of them are playing games, 4 on their phones. I got to those students ask them to put their phones away and work, they don’t even acknowledge that I said anything. 

We get to the last 10 minutes of class, students pack up and stand by the door, I talk, demand, beg, yell, and harass them to sit back down, they ignore me and continue on. 

If it was one class I would understand and I’ve talked to other teachers and they are experiencing the same issue right now as well. It’s just so disheartening to stand in a room and talk to myself. 

To;dr: my students don’t do anything and don’t care that I’m even in the room."

Leomonade_For_Bears	2021-01-21 22:18:25+00:00	Other teachers not following policies making us all look bad.	"I know this is not exclusively during covid,  but it has certainly highlighted the worst of it. A large portion of our switch back to in person was due to outcry that ""the teachers are on vacation "" which isn't true.  Except for the teachers that went to their family cabins, wear hoodies/lounge clothes during zooms, have a TV playing in the background, and even one who zoomed their classes while ice fishing. Some teachers (although not publicly) even talk about how they picked up day drinking and would just have a beer sitting off camera while working.       
       
Now due to public outcry we're in person again.  Those same teachers that gave us a bad rep during online learning are continuing it.  Not enforcing social distancing, masks, etc.  Not reading mandatory protocol for their first hour classes, and not playing the daily announcements which there is time built in to the schedule for.  These are the same teachers who make me look like a villain for enforcing our regular school policies, like cell phones.

russell16688	2021-01-21 21:07:48+00:00	What lockdown is teaching me	"Here in the UK, we are back in lockdown so schools are only open to vulnerable/key worker children. Our school currently operates a week in/week at home rota system so I'm spending a lot more time away from school and the kids.

I couldn't hate it more.

I thought being at home would be a dream - plenty of time, no distractions, coffee when I want, and toilet trips when you need them (not an hour later). I couldn't have been more wrong and I miss my class.

Which other job are people gutted they missed a Zoom call?

Which other jobs will someone purely do work because they've seen your face?

Where else does someone get excited to complete work because they know it will make you happy?

Where else do you hear at work someone's happy purely because you're there?

Don't get me wrong the job can be hard but seeing my most challenging child get up early, purely to do a call with me so he could do some writing (which he hates) really reset my view on teaching.

I hope this helps you to just reflect on some of those positives that make you smile. Who's that kid that just says something nice to you for no reason? Who thanks you for spending that little extra time with them? Who's just happy because you're their one solid element in an otherwise crazy world?

That's why we teach."

On one hand, I recognize that this student is a child and has (I hope) years of maturity and growth ahead of her. However, I have had her in class the last two years and she is fully unpleasant. While a decent student (she's not taken any challenging courses), she is mean, rude, and always has a poor attitude that has made her unpopular among her peers and other teachers. She doesn't take accountability and always defers blame to others. I've only collected a handful of names over the past several years of students I do not like, and she has made that shortlist. 

While I don't wish to jeopardize this student's ambitions, I also truly don't feel like I can speak positively about her without lying. Any advice? If I decline, how do you suggest communicating that?"

So I’ve been meaning to write this post for awhile, I just didn’t really know how to put all of this out there. 

I’m in my first few years of teaching (sorry for being vague) and I absolutely LOVE the students at my school and admin... however I’m not a fan of the district as a whole sometimes and my immediate team members drive me up a wall. 

We don’t have much in the way of curriculum, and so it has been up to us to “figure it out” which has somehow been twisted to me being the only one figuring it out. I work with veteran teachers who have been at the same school for many years who for some reason can’t be bothered to make a lesson.

If they do make anything, they don’t share it. 
If I make something and don’t share it, I get shamed in a super passive aggressive way. 

One teacher in particular that I work with, takes personal offense if I do not greet them every morning and spend time during plan in their classroom... even when I have things to grade and lessons to plan... to the point of them often coming in my room and saying things like, “it’s just so nice when people come and say hi to me in the morning.” They also have had tantrums during planning time and have wasted an entire plan. 

When admin found out about this, I was supported in the decisions for lessons that I was making, but also was told to start being a leader... which has resulted in me sharing more of my stuff than before while still getting nothing in return.

I am able to get along with my coworkers in my department on a super surface level, but it just feels super toxic. 

I really like working with the kids, and admin is usually very supportive so I just don’t know what to do... and will it actually be better at a different school?"

I currently work for the family business which makes a little bit less than a public school teacher but a bit more than some other teachers, so that prospect seems okay, but it does have me worried a bit. 

What would you say the challenges of being a teacher are? I get that you have to work longer hours, but you get the summers off, right? This isn't a shot at you all at all. I just like the idea of working a lot and then taking extended breaks if that makes sense. 

I really like the idea of teaching either science or social studies but I'm leaning towards science since it will be a little bit easier to find a job.

I am a senior BS Chemistry major who has recently been thinking about making the jump into teaching high school after some major thinking. I am in an ACS certified degree program, rather than an education focused. I have gotten a lot of research experience and lab time, though I enjoy it, I feel like to make me content in life I would want to have a career in teaching where I am making a difference in people's lives and (hopefully) exciting them for chemistry and the sciences. This has been my first semester since 2018 that I haven't TA'd for a chemistry course and I really miss helping students out!

 However, the toughest thing for me is that I feel that I am too late in figuring out this decision. I am almost graduated and I am completely lost in figuring out how I would go about getting a teaching certificate in the state of Ohio, without going back to school for an education degree (and thus breaking my bank account). I am planning on getting an MS in chemistry as well, would this be a good idea if I would want to pursue a career in teaching? What would be the best plan of action?

"As the title said I recently remembered how much I love children and how good I am with them (got my baby niece to thank for that). I switched from a business major to early elementary teaching and I had the idea to quit my current job (amazon warehouse) and become a tutor for little kids. I figured it would be easier since I don't have my degree quite yet and it would give me good experience. Plus with classes being online and working parents not always having the time to supervise it would be easier to find a job.

Are there any websites I should check out? Is it even possible without the degree? Is it actually a good idea? Is this even the right subreddit for this? Any advice?

These types of posts, more more importantly how often I see them in comparison to any enthusiasm for the profession; this scares me to no end. 

As someone who can’t really afford to change majors, and picked Biology Education because, I felt a calling to teach (for reasons + my super motivational sob story I don’t want to type out). I am locked in at this point and the dumpster fire I have witnessed has made me horrified for my future career. 

Is it really that bad? Are the melodramatic voices just the ones that are heard best? Something based on the  Virus that will not be named?

Will I be ok in the long run? Is it going to be hell getting there? I’m honestly just very worried for my well being, as this degree has cost me everything and I’m really praying graduation is the light at the end of this tunnel.

For reference, I teach 11/12th English as part of an integrated ""lab"" (classroom) at a technical high school, with two co-teachers who teach science. It's my first year teaching and we've been fully online this year.

I don't have much to compare it to, but I know that in some ways I'm very lucky -- our admin is very supportive, I work with two veteran teachers who know a lot, it's a hands-on program that offers the kids a lot of opportunities. The school culture is great and my co-teachers and I get to design our own curriculum.

Unfortunately, there are some fundamental elements of the position that make it feel like not a great fit for me. I'm not very interested in teaching English through the context of science, which has effected my motivation to design curriculum (which I would normally love). While I'm grateful that I wasn't alone for this year and I have learned a lot from my co-teachers, I'm a very independent person/teacher and I don't like always having to run things by them or work together to build curriculum. We have different perspectives on some things that I think are really important (discussing current events, culturally sustaining pedagogy, etc). Also, one of my co-teachers is very toxic in the way she talks about coworkers and students, and her negative attitude has started to influence the way I view our kids and their potential.

How did you know whether your position was right for you? Am I being too selective? Is it normal to prefer not to work in such a collaborative setting, or am I just not being a good sport?

Most importantly, when would I need to start looking for other positions? What is the process like for changing to a different school within the same district? How do I let my boss know I'm looking for other positions? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks!"

mowyourass	2021-01-20 02:51:56+00:00	Is getting a full time teaching job (your own classroom) hard? Currently anxious about the future.	"Hi fellow teachers! 

I am currently employed as a teachers assistant in a public elementary school. I am in a REACH program Special Education classroom. At the same time, I am currently attending Hofstra University to get my masters in Elementary Special Education in inclusive settings, as well as general education. 

Talking to a lot of teachers at my school have gotten me very stressed out and anxious. They keep telling me how hard it is to get a teaching job (your own classroom). I graduate in a year, student teach the upcoming fall semester. I graduate in the middle of next year, so it may be hard to get a job.. which I’m worried about. 

My question is: is getting a full time teachers job at a public school terribly hard? I know I have a year to go but I am very stressed and it’s currently keeping me up a night. 

Thank you!"

I busted my ass for 6 months to get good at doing assignments on Canvas. I’ve been carrying our long term sub through the ridiculous learning process that is Canvas ( no, my district didn’t offer any training! Just watch a video, duh). I was just finishing my assignments on Canvas for the week YESTERDAY. Nothing seemed amiss, no notification or announcement or email from Canvas telling me they were going to rock my world with a crazy-ass update.
Today, everything looks the same until you go to edit a page or assignment. The rich content editor is COMPLETELY FUCKING DIFFERENT. It’s so different that I had to just give a link for an assignment. I feel like I have to learn Canvas all over again IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR. 
Of course, I got ahold of the Canvas help desk and they can’t do anything but give me a link to retrain myself on using their rich content editor. I don’t know who the asshole or assholes at Canvas are that made this call, but I’d just like to thank that person or people for making an already hard and shitty year worse. Maybe this new content editor is somehow magically easier and I’m just so fucking stunned that such a major change would be made in the middle of the year that I can’t see the value of this change just yet. 
I’m just so upset that I spent so long learning stupid Canvas to have the rug pulled out from under me. End rant. Thanks if you read this!"
Sahrs17	2021-01-20 01:14:37+00:00	When will I believe I know what I am doing?	"I'm in my 2nd year, in a good school district.  But to say I've spent the past year and a half with Impostor Syndrome would be an understatement.  I am surrounded by experts, and I constantly worry about what I'm teaching when or how I'm teaching it.  Or that I'm not doing enough.

My mentor has told me I am doing very well for a new teacher, and I can see that I've grown from a year ago, but I just want to feel confident my abilities.  I dont believe like a successful teacher.

I've heard that you don't really ""teach"" until your third or fourth year; you're just surviving and learning until then.  Is that true?"
ediblethrowaway1991	2021-01-20 00:43:57+00:00	Feeling called out as the only white male teacher during my our school's leadership and equity meeting	"Hey /r/teaching, I would really appreciate someone to provide some perspective for me here.

For context, I'm a second year elementary school teacher at a pretty nice school in Berkeley CA. Most families are fairly affluent and about 30-40% of our students are minorities. I'm the only male teacher at this site. 

I signed up for the Leadership Committee and the Tech Team this year because I knew that I would have a lot more time with distance learning and I wanted to get my feet wet in leadership positions. We have been meeting twice a month with an anti-racist coach (hired from outside of our district) to talk about anti-racism, white supremacy, and equity policy. 

I consider myself pretty far on the left, maybe would classify myself as a democratic socialist if that matters. I'm open to new ideas and certainly open to learning about habits or tendencies that I'm doing or notice that are systemically oppressive in one way or another. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I'm definitely trying to put my best foot forward.

The issue is, I felt like I was being singled out and attacked by the anti-racist coach during today's meeting. We were all asked to reflect on questions related to white normalcy within and outside of the classroom that we notice or perpetuate, as well as potential policies that we could consider to combat these issues. All great stuff, truly! The 8 other teachers in the meeting had really eye opening stories to share that really enlightened me to some of the things that were happening behind the scenes. One black teacher shared how parents would follow up with her after a meeting to bullet point ""these are thing that you said you would do"" but completely code switch when they were in a shared meeting with the teacher and the principle, acting much less threatening. Other issues of white parents leaving multiple paragraph emails to try and make the class work around their child, teachers noticing that black students are unfairly punished for small rule breaking, and the like. 

Every teacher had shared something but I was taking it all in. I was learning a lot from the perspectives of these teachers, and I was really surprised to hear how different their experience was to mine. It was never the norm that everyone had to share, and I didn't really feel like I had anything else to contribute after the rest of the teachers had. Still, the coach stopped another teacher mid sentence to have me chime in on what I was thinking (I at first thought this was a kind gesture from her to allow me to speak in case I was feeling shy or something). I let her and the group know that I didn't have much to add, seeing as I'm only a 2nd year teacher, both of my teaching years have been abnormal due to 1st year teaching and covid this year, and that I just really appreciated getting the insights from everyone that had shared and that I needed to think about how these questions applied to me. I also admitted that I realized that I probably didn't share these experiences because I was a new, white male teacher. 

Even after this, the coach (in my eyes) started to attack what I was saying and asked me to ""really dig deep to find your white racism"" as if what I was saying earlier was an attempt at deflection. I was honestly a little taken aback, and asked her what she was trying to get at. She said ""I know if you think hard enough there are a lot of things that you are probably doing as a white male teacher that are upholding white normalcy, and I think you should reflect on that"". I kinda nodded and put myself on mute. 

There was a long silence, and then I realized she wanted me to do this type of ""soul searching"" right here, live! I just want to stress again, I'm the youngest, least experienced, only male teacher in this group and I thought I had very politely answered just as adequately as any other teacher in the call. I felt a little emarassed and said ""Ohh, you want me to do that now? Like I said, I don't think this is something that I can just ""admit to"" without thinking about first. As for noticing these patterns at school, as a 1st year teacher I was only thinking about getting through the next day. This year, we are all isolated in our own Zoom bubbles, so of course I'm not going to notice these practices unless they are shared from other teachers like in this meeting - which is why I joined. I will definitely reflect more on the prompts, which is what I said I wanted to do when you first asked for my input"". 

I hoped that was the end of it, but she kind of turned to address the group and said ""See, we all need to learn to be vulnerable and honest about how we are all contributing to this. It started with admitting there is a problem. This kind of work takes time"". It felt like I was being singled out and put on trial! She didn't do this to ANY other teacher. 

I honestly am a little lost for words. I am not perfect by any stretch, but my intentions are genuine. I just can't comfortably sit here and be painted as some perpetrator of racism and white supremacy because what I shared was my truth wasn't good enough for her to hear. I feel like this woke attitude of everyone is the perpetrator of these actions regardless if you are doing everything you can to make a positive change is extremely disheartening and goes against the very purpose of this type of work. 

Well /r/teaching, what do you think? Is my white privilege showing from this post, or do I actually have a right to feel phased by this?"

ALMONDandVANILLA	2021-01-19 16:15:09+00:00	Student Empathy	"I wish the students had a little empathy for us.

I tried doing jamboards today because other teacher said their kids thought they were fun.

I asked basic questions about electrons and orbitals. Topics we've gone over for at least 6 weeks at this point.

Not a single person put anything until I begged for them to at least look it up if they didn't know. Then I got a copy and paste answer.

Why should I try to do anything fun or interactive if I get silence? 

Its so demoralizing when I ask questions and nobody responds. I feel like I'm talking to myself. At least I have a sense of humor when I really am talking to myself.

I'm currently a high-school senior doing distance learning, and I've noticed that many of Zoom's features could be improved for online classes. In my classes' Zoom rooms, for instance, my teachers never notice that students are raising their hands because the ""raise hand"" indicator is so small.

I made a free website called Dashbrain that creates a better chat experience for Zoom in just a couple of clicks, with clearer raise-hand notifications, one-click polls, Q&amp;A features, custom group-chats (instead of just ""everyone""), and exporting the chat to a PDF. It works similarly to Kahoot, where you tell students a short 5-digit code, and then they can join the group. If you're interested in it, you can find it here: [school.dashbrain.us](https://school.dashbrain.us). It's entirely free, and has helped many hosts I know, so I hope you find it helpful as well.

I am currently in my second year of teaching K-5 general music in Michigan.  I love what I do.  My partner and I are currently looking at moving locations to get a start on our lives.  Where we live is quite expensive.  Both of us have a great deal of love for the Rochester area of NY and the added bonus is that I am highly considering the University of Buffalo for a master's degree. 

I'm looking for some advice on where to look for open positions, what to consider, what I might not be thinking about, and overall how to do this responsibly.  I know that music education in NY is highly regarded (which is a big reason why I would like to move there) and the professional organization I am a part of has a larger community than the chapter I'm currently a part of in MI.

PM-ME-DOGS-PLEASE	2021-01-19 00:15:04+00:00	“Are you on social media instead of teaching?”	"Friday was a work catch-up day for the whole high school. No new work.One student came to class and proudly announced they would not be working today. This student was behind and needed to catch up, but I often catch them goofing off during class and work time. They’ll be in another meet with friends while also in class, editing google docs with friends, won’t open assignments during work time even with prompts. On Friday I point blank said “do this assignment, it’s the easiest to do and you’ll finish within 20 mins”. Nope. Fine, there’s other kids who need my help. 


 I was working from home so I had one laptop open in google meets with my classes, and another I used to watch their screens and answer questions through chat. I’m answering questions through chat and helping students through google docs, also talking to kids verbally so they knew I was still there (a true juggling act) when I hear an email notification. The parent of the student mentioned earlier accuses me of being on social media instead of teaching. They also say their student could really use my help getting caught up rather than sitting on my computer. 


I am.... still enraged. Responded respectfully explaining that while it may look like I’m slacking, I’m helping students work on another laptop. I mentioned their student declined to work that day.


Even when I know and have proof that I’m in the right, these parent emails are still so hurtful. Do we eventually get over this?"

I’m an MBA student and my Economics professor is using a hybrid-delivery teaching method where 50% of students will be attending class via Zoom and the other 50% in-person. This also goes for exams, which are closed-book, closed-note and taken real-time during class. There aren’t any deterrents to cheating other than the honor code. 

The exams are curved based on class averages and I’m deeply worried about the online students using their notes and computers on the exams and killing the curve for the in-person students (not to mention the honest virtual ones). Spoiler Alert: **this is what happens Every. Single. Time.** It’s made even worse because looking at the course roster, most of the poorly-performing students opted to be online while most of the strong students are in-person. 

Obviously the default answer is “just study harder” but.... come on.... 

Any suggestions?"
cyberlover2	2021-01-18 18:20:46+00:00	Is it weird to contact old high school teachers?	"I am currently in my first year of post-secondary school and I did so well in my first semester's English course that my professor paid me to put my creative non-fiction piece in his course outline to teach this semester. 

My old high school teacher was always super encouraging, nice, and kind to me, and I have not talked to him in almost a year after he left my high school before I graduated last year. We exchanged goodbye messages and visited him with my friends on his last day to say goodbye and we all cried, to be honest. 

I sent him a message and he said that he isn't worried about me and that my writing is great, blah blah blah, and that he would remember my writing well into his old age. Also, I want to become a teacher now, partly because of him. 

I really want to update him and tell him about how I'm doing in college, so I asked my brother who is in the same school as him to ask him for an email so I could email him. Is that weird? Am I crossing a boundary? I think it would be important to keep in contact because I might need references for university and also... just because!

TLDR; I want to update an old teacher about how I am doing in college but want to make sure it isn't weird to ask for contact info."

I found this career a little by accident, but I love it. That being said, I have a degree in history, and minor/concentration in sustainable food education and climate change management, so I haven’t studied the pedagogy and techniques for teaching. 


I teach/assist in lower elementary (1st-3rd grade) and, while my co-teachers are wonderful, they are overworked and have a lot to do all the time. We also don’t have an in school counselor (long story - this has been a rough year, as you all know) and because of that, we don’t have any help with the neuroatypical students we have. My main co-teacher, for what it’s worth, is also extremely high energy and constantly frazzled. I have severe ADHD and it’s a lot for me most of the time. 


We’re working on getting help for this one little girl (who hasn’t been tested because the new York system kind sucks) but we have a girl who will be a first grader next year with autism. She is a wonderful, intelligent kid who struggles with transitions and new environments. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for classes or courses of study or even books to read. I love this kid and I don’t want her to get left behind because no one knows how to help her, so I want to spend some time familiarizing myself with the best ways to help.

LadyCitlalicue	2021-01-18 17:17:08+00:00	Am I wrong for being extremely annoyed at this one student and his mom for this?	"A little bit of context. I’m a paraed and our school hours go up till about 1 and then I have office hours until 200. We are all virtual btw. From those school hours I work with 3 different teachers and their classes. A big part of my job is helping lower kids learn to read and help non English speaking students learn English and what’s going on in the classroom. There’s one particular class I spend more time in because that’s how my school made my schedule. And in this particular class I have a student who still has not learned much English.

I completely understand students like this, because I was a struggling English learner myself and completely empathize with them. 

After our school hours end, I have office hours where I contact parents who have reached out to me if they have questions regarding their student, problems with their computers or logging in, and just helping them with any problem or question that comes to them. 

Since the beginning of the school year, I knew how great this students need to learn English was and the need to catch up with our class because he had just came from Mexico back in February of last year. I worked with him when school was still open, and for some reason after really trying to socialize and open up to him, he never opened up to me or liked talking to me, which is different because a lot of students who don’t speak English but spanish as I do, have found a connection to me and feel very comfortable in speaking to me, he never did. Instead of gravitating towards the students who did speak Spanish and were very polite and playful kids, he gravitated towards the 2 REALLY AWFUL students and was basically a little punk. Then school shut down and here were are months later starting virtual school.

His mom starts telling me how he is so low, he needs more translating which I was already providing for but apparently because our school isn’t Dual Immersion, we can’t translate everything and plus, some parents have already complained about not translating everything as it takes a lot of time away which is understandable. 

I then start taking time from my office hours and I make my own zoom meeting for him, just to come up with a lesson plan for every day of the week and meet up with him so he could be better in his English and everything else. He was pretty bright in math but ELA was hard for him. My classes with him started in September and went on until right before we went on winter break. 

After that I just feel so over it and here’s why. The last week before break, I was trying to be fun and showing him a video of Christmas English words and I’m like “okay we’re gonna review the words okay so look at the screen and we’ll say the words too okay!” And eventually after the first video played, I showed him another video and he was just looking down not paying attention. I’d catch him do that plenty of times but I guess seeing him every flipping day of the school year really bothered me. He never really was interested in talking to me or socializing like the other kids I work with, also he rarely made an effort to try and speak the little English he knew like yes and no, until finally I told him he should practice answering in English and constantly kept correcting his response to English. I know you may think that’s a bit harsh but for me, the yes and no words are simple, and not saying this until December when we started in September kinda annoyed me. And it also bothered me that I would tell his mom I see progress in him but she’s then say oh really oh it’s cuz sometimes he can’t understand what’s going on in class and he throws tantrums and I’m like lady I literally tell you every time he doesn’t understand something to tell me in my class or else I’ll help him in other areas. It’s like she didn’t really show much appreciation which other times she did, but that really annoyed me like I’m taking time out of my work day to help him one on one and I’m doing it as a favor, EVERYDAY. I didn’t tell her this but that’s what I thought. Other times I just felt like he just didn’t put as much effort in to the class as he could have. I just feel like he doesn’t care. I caught his dad telling him this same thing which was what I needed to hear, he said that I do this out of a favor to him and he feels like he doesn’t care to try. And I’ve gone over so many letters, sounds, sight words with him and just so many things and I’m just so over the fact that I feel he doesn’t care to try to really know these things and he has a dad and aunt there who speak English so it bothers me that by now especially after spending so many months one on one day by day he still doesn’t remember much. I see him really trying when either his aunt that speaks English is there or his dad. Other than that he’s like whatever’s. I just don’t want to keep having a class with him. I told his mom I don’t have time to have class yet since she asked last week but ugh I’m just so frustrated with them. I feel like they could do a lot more at home and act like they can’t. Am I wrong?"

This will only take a maximum of 20 - 30 minutes. I would be very thankful if anyone has got the time and some insights to share. I'm free to talk via a short call or even via chat. If interested I can also share the insights I gained by teaching in Switzerland.

I'm looking forward to an informative and interesting exchange!"
jennyjenjen23	2021-01-18 14:16:45+00:00	My favorite two points a parent made in an email to me and my humble responses.	"1.) “You need to reconsider the grades you’re giving these kids...” (edited for punctuation and spelling)

Hmmm...last I knew, I wasn’t giving grades out willy nilly but seeing if students were able to answer questions correctly when asked. If a student leaves that question blank, meaning there is nothing written for it, even the most lax of graders would count off. Also, if I was just giving out grades, they’d be on some weird scale no one else understands (Maebe’s crocodile in spelling would seem normal).

2.) “I know all these kids deserve zeros.” 

Take a moment to stifle your laughter. If we got into who “deserved” what, it would be a bloodbath, especially since the particular class I have this year cheats as naturally as breathing. I’ve watched students pass around one person’s completed work and then everyone turns it in. Those assignments go straight to the trash because I’m not taking my time grading it if they didn’t take time to do it.

I’m pretty lenient when it comes to grading assignments other than manor grades. For homework, I call it Completion+. Since homework is practice, I don’t want to hit a student who is still learning, so if I can tell they made a real effort to answer correctly, they get the points. If it’s one word that has no connection to the topic, is skipped, or is the definition off Google with zero thought to how it would tie into the class (for example, if they were asked to define “bow” and we were learning about the Battle of Agincourt, if they define it as a piece of ribbon tied to the end of a child’s pigtail, it would be wrong) no credit is awarded.

This particular parent emailed me Friday after her student emailed me twice earlier that day. I was not at school because I had to take my child for some medical tests. I really think these people think we live in a closet at school, desperately waiting to do their bidding."

As a way of replacing that experience, I am searching for a teacher that would be willing to let me participate virtually in one of their lessons and maybe also have a small conversation about cultural differences in teaching approach and the school system in your English-speaking country. I am very interested in learning more about different teaching cultures and approaches around the world. I know this costs time and effort but as a small replacement I could provide an input for the class and tell them about life in Switzerland or if you give German lessons it would be an opportunity for your pupils to speak to a native speaker."

"hello! i’m a current college student majoring in elementary education (on a pk-4th grade track). i still have two years left until i get my degree, but i’m already starting to consider my post-grad plans. i want to teach in a state where getting a masters degree is required, so i know for sure that i am going to go to grad school, but i’m not sure if i should go directly into grad school after undergrad and start teaching after i get my masters, or if i should take a teaching job out of college and get my masters while i’m teaching. i know there are pros and cons to both. i’d like to get my masters in 2 years or less, and i know that may not be possible while teaching full time. i would like to devote the majority of my time to my classes and i feel like teaching and going to grad school at the same time may be too much. the only thing making me hesitant to go straight to grad school is knowing that some schools won’t hire you because they will have to pay you more if you have a masters (and that a masters without any work experience is basically worthless). if anyone would like to share their experience getting their masters, i’d love to hear both perspectives! thanks in advance!"

"I'm currently doing my student teaching in Indiana but want to move to Seattle once I graduate to be closer to family. One thing I have a lot of anxiety about is being able to find a job. Seattle Public Schools is having a February hiring fair but it excludes Secondary Science and that's got me extremely worried. I'm hoping someone will be able to offer some insight to how hiring works for Seattle and the surrounding districts. 

Since its probably important my content area is secondary science, specifically Earth/ Space science. I'm also willing to teach middle school science and would be able to get a biology endorsement if it was necessary to increase my odds of finding a job. Thank you in advance."

"After hours of googling, I’ve learned that almost every piece of advice on the internet is just an advertisement in disguise, so I’ve come to Reddit.

I live in Pennsylvania and have three years of preschool teaching experience. I’d probably like to teach music, but I’m open to gen ed.

Knickdelta	2021-01-17 19:50:38+00:00	Teaching Scholarship Calculus	"Hi Guys, this year I am teaching a class that has a sole focus of gaining a Scholarship in Calculus. This is the highest level a high school student can achieve in mathematics within the public education system of New Zealand.

I am very comfortable teaching the normal calculus curriculum but what these students need is not MORE calculus, but harder calculus problems that test their problem solving and lateral thinking, not just higher skill sets like what is found at university. Scholarship papers don't stray outside of curriculum but instead test their understanding of calculus with uniquely challenging problems that require ""tricks"" to solve.

So my closing question is; where can I find some of these types of problems that I can distribute in class and tutorials to give them that higher level problem solving experience.

Thanks!"

Destinyyy_cyan	2021-01-17 17:27:34+00:00	Hel! Should I appeal my grade?	Graduating senior with 2 courses to graduate one was Spanish 2. I made an A in Spanish one so I thought it would be fine for me to take Spanish two (one of my last requirements) during the mini mester. Well it was extremely hard and I only passed one exam and I’m at like a 69 without the final with I believe I did bad on. I studied for this class but I just couldn’t get a grasp. However many (I won’t say all) were cheating by using translators on the test. And have admitted it in our class GroupMe. I do not cheat and I take it very seriously. If I were to expose my class I seriously wouldn’t want to get anyone in trouble (I would block out their names) but I would use it as a means of justification as to say I shouldn’t fail if so many people are only doing good because they are cheating. They’ve talked about it almost every test. I’ve tried talking with my professor about my exam before and mind you he didn’t post a single lecture we basically taught ourselves on this website. To be fair I was basically working full time and that is on me but everyone else is just about to skate by. Do I have a fair chance?

It's my favorite and my students' favorite because they can finally give me some very strong opinions! Last week we looked at The Great Debaters and the debate over whether civil disobedience is moral or not. In order to understand the text, we had to go over what exactly civil disobedience is and is NOT, and various times during American history where it was used.

During discussions, one of my students mentioned that civil disobedience or, at a minimum, peaceful protesting, is the only way positive social change has ever happened. I'm not a history teacher, but I couldn't think of a counter argument for that, and I try to always push back, no matter what side they take (that way I'm not ""pushing an agenda""). In fairness, I told them I'd try to find some times where social change hasn't had a period of  some amount of civil disobedience or peaceful protest just prior. Any ideas?"
newsieducks0506	2021-01-17 04:41:27+00:00	"New teacher jitters, I guess??"	"So, I was pretty emotional today after the truth just sunk into me that I am not a college student anymore and that I am a newly-licensed high school math teacher. What’s more amazing is that I got hired in a magnet school as my very first teaching job and I don’t know if I should be excited or terrified, but I’m very terrified knowing that I will probably have the whole admin watching me from time to time.

However, I also had to make a quick, maybe life-changing, decision on stepping back on my tutoring job at my local college I work at for 8 years now. I guess my rationale was that it’s time for me to grow as a professional and person, like spreading my wings and fly....but a part of me just doesn’t want to let go of that comfort zone that I had for a long time, where I know what to do in my job and being on auto pilot as a math tutor. I guess it’s because I felt way more confident as a tutor than as a new teacher. I knew the ins and out and the rules in my old workplace like the back of my hand, but with this new upcoming job, I feel like I’m going to do a lot of my own research and digging since we’re all still in remote learning. I really enjoyed my work while tutoring college students since they’re mostly adults now and I don’t have to be always worried about what I should or shouldn’t wear or the way I talk because my workplace really encourage us to be business casual. I know this new teaching job is only temporary because I’m taking over another teacher who’s on maternity leave, but there’s just so many uncertainties I’m feeling that I also ask myself what did I get into. Also, I’m now responsible of these children’s education and that’s a pretty scary thought. 

I’m proud myself on taking a huge risk on this gradual transition from a math tutor to a high school teacher, but I’m also pretty scared on what lies ahead during this pandemic. (Also, knowing that my first teacher paycheck won’t come in until next month and I kinda need the extra income after not having a paid job for months due to student teaching.) Anyways, sorry about this long rant/vent. Any tips or advice for a new teacher is welcome. I’m going to need it very soon."
Necessary_Basil6473	2021-01-17 02:36:23+00:00	Male Teachers and Coaching	"I'm currently a male high school student, and I'm considering high school education. The problem that I'm having is that I've done a lot of reading about males and education, and most of what I've has said that the majority of them get hired because they also coach sports. That's true for my school as well. All of the male teachers coach football, basketball, baseball, or wrestling. I've never really been interested in sports, so I have no interest in coaching. That being said, would I have a hard time getting a job as a teacher, and would I be looked down upon for not coaching as well?

Vallena816	2021-01-16 22:43:03+00:00	Looking for just the right song to use as an example for an intro to poetry	"In my 5th grade class, I would like to introduce poetry as a new genre for students to be creative and share personal feelings/experiences. (And like the sneak I am, they will also be practicing word choice, concrete details, and fluency). The final assignment will be a poem based on a template from George Ella Lyons' poem ""Where I'm From.""

Most of them know nothing about poetry, but, naturally, they all like music. I would like to begin by showing students the parallels between music and poetry. I'm looking for some example songs that have somewhat traditional verse/refrain structures so students can see how stanzas work. I would also like the poem to have repeated phrases (just like how the example poem has the anaphora ""I'm from..."" at the beginning of almost every line). And if the song tells an interesting story and has some striking imagery, that is a plus. 

Any ideas?"

Mxgnum92	2021-01-15 22:53:31+00:00	Advice Needed: Teaching Abroad	"Hello all, 

I [M, 28] am a Primary school teacher currently teaching Year 3 in London, UK. 

I have got an undergrad degree in politics, a years experience as a HLTA at an Academy, a years experience as an unqualified teacher, a PGCE from UCL and 2 years of qualified teaching experience (NQT year and this current academic year) 

I’ve always wanted to teach abroad and think that this is the year that I want to go. 

My main reason for this is a change in environment and financial motivation. 

I’ve always fancied the Middle East (preferably Kuwait, Saudi, Qatar, UAE) and wanted to seek advice from fellow teachers that have embarked upon this route. 
What is the best steps to take? Is it via agency? If so, are there any agencies you can recommend? 

I have a certain salary in mind which is around £4000 a month (which I have read and been told is pretty standard for expat teachers) and wanted to ask whether this is realistic and feasible. 

I understand the whole world is on standstill due to COVID, but I feel that this is the period in which I’d like to capitalise and finally take the step to move out and embark upon my own journey. 

I have seen some adverts that are offering these positions for August, but wanted to clarify whether there are any major and minor things I should look out for before I submit my applications and go ahead with this process. 

Any and all advice is appreciated. 

Thanks, 

M"

thebeeboy	2021-01-15 19:02:32+00:00	Working 9 hours a day with no break is getting a little tiring.	"I recently took over our ""MVP"" program, which is basically just a partnership with local public schools to enlist their students at our daycare during their remote learning days while their parents work. First, none of the teachers here get paid enough for any of the positions we work. The DOE and executive director of our school have a set salary, so their wages aren't effected by working from home or leaving school early (which they do often). Second, I haven't had a mandated break since September. To ease the scheduling issues while we were understaffed due to COVID-19, I was asked if I could skip my break on the days that I work (part-time). I initially said yes because I really needed the extra money and didn't mind since I had just returned back to work and was weary about losing any more hours or pay because of the pandemic. Despite the fact that our school is pretty much back to regular staff numbers now, I am literally the only person in the building who doesn't receive a break even though there is at least one teacher available, in addition to my executive director, who can easily come to my classroom and break me.

To make matters worse, I also had a rough time receiving my FMLA pay from the company after asking to quarantine due to a potential exposure at my school. I received no income for an entire month waiting for my FMLA pay in between pay periods.

I'm finally looking for other teaching positions in the area. Having to ask to use the bathroom at work is getting pretty obnoxious, and I seriously just don't get paid enough for this. 

Is there anyone who works or has worked in a daycare/preschool setting and has faced similar issues?"

gr8pefruits	2021-01-15 17:46:46+00:00	Got let go with no notice	"Hello. So some background: I recently graduated with my teaching degree this past semester. I have been a long term sub for this school since the fall, where I finished out my student teaching with a full time position being full on, real life teacher. I was originally told they would probably need me until the end of the school year. 

Fast forward to yesterday. As I was leaving, the principal stopped me and said, “Oh by the way the teacher you’re covering for is returning to work.” So I of course ask when so I can start applying elsewhere. And he told me he wasn’t sure. Well I walk into work today, and to my surprise, the teacher is back, here, and ready to work. She told me she didn’t know I would still be here. The principal tells me today that I can stay for another week under sub pay (what I’ve been making this whole time) and basically be an aid for the returning teacher. 

I am just pretty upset. I could have spent all winter break applying elsewhere and getting prepared to have to find a new teaching job. Now I have no time, no job, loads of student debt, and bills. Why wouldn’t anyone tell me? And does anyone have any advice going forward? Should I stay for the next week? I mostly just needed to rant. 

Lastly, the part that hurts the most is how much I’m going to miss the kids. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to comment."

carleneaw	2021-01-15 08:08:19+00:00	Diary from the Zoom Room	"I am an online Elementary teacher who decided to jump head first into the unknown this year (the Zoom classroom). I knew that I would need to become vulnerable as hell. 

This experience has come with a surge of insecurities and self-doubt, but I’ve managed to power through the awkward moments because I know that I care enough to put my ego aside and practice some humility in the face of an uncertain educational system and a crisis of our nation. 

(Some of the more experienced teachers, and maybe even the ones who are just starting out, can relate). And here’s why ...

Not every parent agrees with the way in which we manage our classrooms. I wish I could paint a generic picture to describe just how challenging this role is (in general) let alone during a pandemic. Don’t forget, we’ve gone virtual now too. But I suppose the best way to sum it up, would look something like this:

Your child is in front of a screen with limited range of mobility and a lack of real-world social interaction. This happens for 6-8 hours in a day and for 5 days in a week. They are becoming EXHAUSTED and irritable. 

Now, I am no doctor, but I did complete an undergraduate degree, published a senior thesis, and earned a teaching certificate by studying Behavioural Psychology and specializing in the field of Childhood Development. I might know a thing or two about this topic ...

To be blunt - your kid is pissed, sometimes downright depressed. In fact, I’ve developed a trusting relationship with your little one. My judgement as their instructor, teammate, mentor, shoulder to cry on, and any other label that carries the meaning, “I have your child’s best interests at heart” should perhaps be taken into consideration before you choose to approach my superiors with a concern that (quite frankly) is lacking in credibility. 

Teachers, have you ever sensed a vibe in your classroom? Have you listened to your instincts and exercised your best judgement to better serve the needs of the young minds that were right in front of you, begging (in not so many words) to be given a break? 

Have you ever been called out by a parent whose energies would be better spent cutting their child (and maybe us) some slack? Perhaps giving him or her a pat on the back for doing their best in this day and age (maybe giving us one too)? Or recognizing that there are LIMITATIONS to a child’s brain, patience, and tolerance? (come to think of it ... I’m a human with these sorts of limitations too) 🤔 hmmm. 

It doesn’t take a neurologist to find any recent TED talk, scholarly article, or research study on the effects of increased screen-time on our ability to absorb information. But here, let me fill you in on what I’ve* been learning this year: 

Increased screen-time equals decreased sleep (especially REM), which equals a decline in cognitive function, leading to a decrease in attention, retention as well as memory recall. Simply put - your child is not going to learn anything in the last 10 minutes of class on a 6-8 hour school day at the end of a 5 day work week, despite the number of times that you email my boss to make it happen. 
But hey, I only studied for 7 years, in preparation for this role, to know what’s going on between their ears. 

These are the real struggles of every teacher, even more so the ones who deliver online. We know that you want the best for your child, and guess what? So do we. 
I have been doing everything that I can to teach my students - but with your presence in our virtual classrooms, reaching them can be so much harder.

Please step away from the camera lens. Trust the process. And trust your children.
Maybe even trust me. 

I will be less effective as their teacher and they will be less comfortable as my students if you don’t."

I have noticed that whenever I brought up that I am an ESL or kindergarten teacher, it is usually looked down on:

""Playing hide and seek isn't teaching!""

""Oh no, like... a real teacher."" 

""How much of an impact can you really make at that age?""

""Playing with 5 year olds isn't teaching...""



These things come from normal people, but they also occasionally come from other teachers. It was something that was really surprising to me when I got into the profession.

Am I a lone case? Maybe I just ran into a few bad apples. What has your guys's experience been?"
dcsprings	2021-01-15 00:37:16+00:00	Last semester I've been handing out exams 4 days before test day because they start asking questions. Should I change?	"Cheating: The worst cheating (several years ago) I've ever had was in a Geography class where the question was ""Why isn't the Earth a perfect sphere."" and a few students answered ""The Earth is an oblate spheroid."" For a number of reasons it was clear that this answer came from their phones. At a minimum it didn't answer why, but even if I gave these particular students credit for that question the still would have scored below 50%. So the cheating I've personally encountered hasn't helped the students and wasn't worth my time to report.

The benefits I see: The ELL's in the class get to clear up any language confusion. The native English speakers get to clear up any language confusion. They ask questions they wouldn't otherwise ask. I teach AP classes, and I'm using questions from the question bank, and past tests so students get accustomed to the style, some of the ""style"" elements are difficult for me to figure out alone, and talking about them in class brings clarity to the students and myself.

Edit: I know I screwed up the title :S"
purplecouchthrowaway	2021-01-15 00:26:27+00:00	Please help me foster better relationships with my entitled parents.	"This is my first year teaching. I teach 2nd grade at a tiny private school and I have a co-teacher/mentor who helps me develop curriculum/work through problems but due to covid I am otherwise on my own in my cohort with 10 students. 

I love my students. I love what we're learning, I love their smiles, I love seeing them grow. I love my co-workers. I feel supported and appreciated by admin. 

But the parents won't. stop. complaining. 

For the past 2 months, there have been non-stop waves of parent complaints (usually the same 3 families). I get at least angry 2 emails at the end of every week. Weeks that I think went great and were successful. 

One parent called the principal on me because I took too long to respond to her email asking me to replace the command hook her son broke that hangs his coat. 

One parent emailed with 10 attachments of her daughter doing multiplication problems at home to say that the math I was teaching was too easy for her and to ask why I wasn't giving her more challenging work. 

One parent's son lies constantly and she believes everything he comes home and says about how mean me and his classmates were to him.

I am trying not to take these to heart. Both my principal and my co-teacher are unphased and say I am doing a good job and not to worry about them, but I take them extremely personally. They are KILLING the joy that I have for my job. Now I walk around all day with parents nagging in the back of my mind, thinking about what they'll say to me later instead of what I can do to better educate their children.

What can I do to stop this? Or at least stop letting it affect me so much? I have started to hate a job I love since it has become so absolutely thankless and full of unhappiness from those I am trying to work together with."
mattashcraft	2021-01-14 22:59:48+00:00	Please give me advice for my 7 year old nephews inability to read/write	"Hello! This is my first time on this sub, but I am desperate. My nephew is 7 years old and has an inability to read and write properly. He was put into a special program at the school but due to covid things didn't stick. He can sing his ABCs and point to the corresponding letter with a few hiccups, particularly the letter H.  


His parents are busy and due to weird circumstances he stays with me and my wife frequently, but we have been ineffective. We have become desperate.  


I am not sure if it is worth noting, but just recently i've discovered he potentially cannot see/hear things in his head. For example, how most of us can 'think' the word, cat. We hear it in our head and we can 'see' a cat. He states that he cannot, and I am not sure if its that I am unable to properly describe how it feels/is, or if he really cant. Outside of a standard potential learning disorder (due to covid he hasn't been able to get evaluated by his teacher for the doctor to diagnose him), I wonder if that could stunt his ability to learn and remember.  


I know that this has been lengthy, but we are desperate and need advice on how we could potentially stimulate him to learn.  


Thanks"
denz88	2021-01-14 20:56:31+00:00	A tool for adding quizzes to online videos	"For the past few months, I’ve been building a tool, Quizbi, that lets anyone create and take quizzes on videos online. The goal is to help people learn more effectively from content that already exists on places like YouTube.

I’ve toyed with this concept for a while now, but the pandemic presented a clearer reason to go and build it. Two observations in particular encouraged me to give this a try.

The first is that remote learning (or any learning for that matter) is really hard for students, their parents, and educators. It’s not uncommon for students to disengage and fall behind. Parents, already stretched thin, have little time to help with their children’s studies.

The second is that most people enjoy watching online videos and they’ve only watched more during the lockdowns. These videos, educational ones included, are by nature engaging and entertaining. Most are optimized for views, likes, and subscribes.

Quizbi puts these well-crafted videos in front of students and gives structure to them. Students receive immediate feedback on their quizzes and can review past results. For an added challenge, quiz takers can also try to submit their own questions that may show up in future quizzes.

I’d love to hear your feedback on [Quizbi](https://quizbi.com) and ideas for how you might use this. And if there’s a topic you’re passionate about, please come and [create a quiz](https://quizbi.com/create)!"

I have self contained English classes. The way our school is set up during covid-19 craziness is I see my students online on Mondays for 45 minutes (a lot are no shows) and then I see them once a week in class for 90 minutes. Prior to winter break we had spent close to a month (or four 90 minute sessions) prepping for a research essay. The kids have been on winter break for 3 weeks and the thought of re-energizing them to write the essay feels daunting. They weren't exactly looking forward to writing it before break either.
Do you ever abandon projects? I don't want all that prep to have been for nothing but I am also not looking forward to pulling teeth for the next 3 weeks to get them writing. Thoughts? Advice?"

I’m a professional volunteering in the community, creating and giving an exam to Jr. High and High School Students.  The material lends itself to “Check all that apply” questions, but I’m at a loss as to the mathematically appropriate method of grading these questions.  Obviously, it can’t just be a point for every correct selection, as then the student can just select every answer without penalty.  

I figure there must be some formula that takes into account the number of correct responses and incorrect responses, and perhaps how many total correct and incorrect choices there are in the question.  

&gt; As an example…


&gt; Q) Which of the following letters has at least one curved segment? [Check all that apply]  {Let's assume the question is worth 3 points, or ""V"" points}


&gt; A) A


&gt; B) B


&gt; C) C


&gt; D) D


&gt; E) E


&gt; F) F

Obviously, the answers are B, C, and D, for 3 points.  But if an examinee selected B, C, and E, what would the score be?  What if they selected just B and C?  


Thanks so much."

Jozrows	2021-01-14 01:38:36+00:00	Anyone made the move from elementary to preschool?	"I have taught elementary for 9 years. Mainly the upper grades but I did a year in first. I took this year off mainly because I didn't want to experience whatever mess came of covid, but also to be with my toddler son. 

I enjoy my time with my son and I did enjoy teaching before I had him. I didn't like teaching anymore because of all of the extra time it took from my son due to grading, planning, meetings, anxiety attacks, etc. 

I think that (a private) pre-k would give me more freedom and allow me to allow my kids to be the kids they are. I have fallen in love with my son at this age and how much he loves to learn. Also, it's really actually part time. My fears are: whiners and their parents.

Due to reasons relating to my generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD and just my personality in general,  I would prefer to teach students in small groups(please don’t judge me I know myself very well and this is best for me and any of my future students). I don’t want a classroom of my own. I’d rather pull students for support or push in and support them that way. I love working with children and helping them succeed. I love working in a field of service and it brings me joy. I just don’t want to be a regular classroom teacher. 

I’m wondering what positions in education I can work in that allows for pulling out and pushing in. I’m also wondering what additional certifications, schooling or anything I would need to be able to work in these positions. 

Right now I’m certified to teach in NY state. My certifications are childhood &amp; students with disabilities (birth-6).I also have my masters in educational technology and an educational technology specialist certification. I’m thinking of also taking some classes and getting the TESOL certification - but I don’t speak any other languages...I’d like to learn some basic Spanish to help with this.

My colleague in the same position is having a difficult time with a particular student and I thought I would seek some advice here.

Basically, the student (4th grade I believe) has a very short attention span and needs to be redirected back to his homework every couple of minutes (if not seconds!). Ex: my colleague asks him what his homework is, he asks her if she wants to see his dog. She asks again and he starts to tell her but then will get distracted again and show her something, etc. (He also moves around a LOT and doesn't grasp how to show her things over Zoom). Ideally he needs an adult in the room with him to help him focus but that can't happen at the moment.

So yeah, posting this in the hopes that some real teachers who have been doing virtual school for awhile now have any tips. Thanks so much! If more information is needed please ask."

Some background: From New York, 24, Male

I've been seriously thinking over the past 6 months to a year of going back to school and becoming a teacher. I'm in NYS and I'm looking to get some more insight and information here before I go and talk with a school so I don't sound entirely clueless. 

Currently I have an Associates Degree for Env. Tech. Now I know this most likely won't help me too much with an education degree, but it should fill my liberal arts/electives section.

I have a full time job, so I would need to do online. I've found SUNY Empire which offers a BA or BS in Educational Studies. Would this be the way to go for a bachelor's for education? Then get all of my certificates and what not after I get my BA or BS? 

I would first like to get my Childhood Education because it seems that's the most surefire way to get your foot in the door and get a job as a teacher. Eventually, I would like to specialize in Earth Science/Environmental Science and the likes and get certificates for these. 

My cousin is a teacher and he said the best route would be to get Childhood Education then get additional certs after. 

I guess I'm just trying to make sure I have a general understanding of what needs to be done before I decide whether to proceed with getting more information from them.

I've been teaching at an international school in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia for 5 years now. Because of COVID, I've stayed in the country for a year longer than I planned and I might be staying for another year. The job is comfortable, not very demanding, and the kids are great--but the pay is stagnant. I'm able to save a great deal of money and I've paid down over $25k of student loans over the past few years.   


However, I know that this isn't where I really want to be the rest of my life. There's no upward potential. There's no possibility of an increase in salary staying at this school. I didn't intend to become a career teacher, but when I look at my resume now, my 20s have basically been spent in education (2 years in Peace Corps teaching English as well). 

I'm dating a girl now who I'm serious about and she's looking at Master's programs abroad in England and Canada. What worries me is that in an English speaking country, I don't think I'll be able to get a job. I have a BA in an unrelated field (International Relations) and all I have for teaching credentials is an online TEFL certificate. To teach in an English speaking country, I imagine that I'd need a degree and/or a teaching license. 

I suffered from impostor syndrome in my first couple years of teaching, but now I believe that I'm actually quite good at it. I enjoy being in the classroom, I just don't enjoy all the paperwork involved with being a teacher. I'm just wondering what my next steps should be to secure a higher paying job in the future--do I go for a Master's degree? If so, is an online degree enough?

If anyone has any insight, please help!"

My school has been online all year and will be for the remainder of the school year, so my students (3rd graders)  pretty much only see my shoulders and head. I’m showing enough now that I think they would be starting to notice if we were in person. A few of my coworkers that I am friends with know and I recently told my administrator, but I haven’t said anything to my students and I actually feel kind of nervous to. I’m not really sure why, to be honest, because I haven’t had any complications so far and I will only be out at the very end of the school year. Part of my wants to tell them but part of me wants to wait until the last possible moment. Any advice on telling my class and answering any of their questions, hearing from parents, etc? Thanks!"

I desperately need some suggestions and advice!!

I teach 6th grade social studies near inner city Detroit. I have one class in particular that thrives on group/partner work and has incredibly poor performance and behavior for individual work.

We went virtual in early December and it's been a huge blessing. I'm able to put them in breakout rooms every single day for a healthy mixture of independent/partner/group work. And hey, I was an English major. I love collaboration and discussion!!

The kids are coming back in person next week and I'm stressing about how to keep up the positive attitudes we've had since going virtual. I don't want to cut them off from partners and group work; I already know it'll cause behavioral issues and be so much more stressful for all of us.

I just don't know how to do it right now. We are still in a pandemic. We still have six-foot distance between desks (not that they listen anyways, but I cannot grant them permission). If they're not next to each other though, they'll be shouting.

Is there some sort of online platform I can use for them to be in chat rooms with one another or something?

What has everyone else been doing??"

pushupbra22	2021-01-11 02:19:16+00:00	First year teacher not wanting to return next year	"Hi everyone 

I’m looking to hear from other teachers how they’re feeling about returning next year.

I’m a first year teacher. Graduated in a middle of a pandemic and teach at an amazing school with kindergarteners. The first half of year had its ups and downs but even through all the craziness I believed I would 100% be back next year. Now it’s January, and I feel strongly that I can not do this again next school year.
I know that this was a strange year especially for a first year teacher, but I want to explore other opportunities that have been presented to me. This opportunity would mean getting the hell out of this state and doing something that would pay more as well as improve my mental health.
All year I’ve been told how amazing I was doing and have been given all the support I could ask for. I love my kindergarteners so much and they are definitely not why I even started considering to not return next year. 

The issue is I feel extreme guilt. Guilt that I went to school for 4 years and pulled out loans. Guilt that my parents will think I’m a disappointment. Guilt that I’ve literally been handed the best school and staff, but still don’t want to return. Guilt that it seems like I’m “quitting” on the kids.

I just want to know how everyone else is feeling right now and if anyone is in the same shoes. How are you handling this? Where is your head at right now? 

I also know that I could always go back to teaching in the future or do other things with my degree. Since I don’t have any kids or mortgage and recently have been engaged I feel like this is the best time for me to go out and explore new career opportunities. I would have been terrified to ever take a risk like this before, but this year has opened my eyes so much that I feel like if I don’t then I will regret it."
forestfire556677	2021-01-10 21:52:37+00:00	How do I tell a student they email me too much?	"I have created and posted charts for my students to follow when they have a question, e.g. can I ask a classmate? Can I google this? Can my question wait for next class or is it urgent?

I still receive very frequent emails from this student, with questions that are definitely not urgent. I feel rude answering the email with anything other than the answer to his question since my thoughts would be “if my teacher had the time to answer the email by telling me to ask a classmate, they could have had the time to just answer my question”, but I also do not want to encourage the emails by responding to them!!!

Ideally id love to say “you email me too much and these questions can easily be resolved on your own, or at the minimum could wait for next class” but I can’t actually do that lol

Solutions? Suggestions? How can I respond with the same point but framed in a “constructive” way that encourages independence?"

(I want to guard against potentially being ‘dined-and-dashed’, since there aren’t any legal protections in place, as this is private tutoring)."	"Hey guys,

I’m a formally certified private tutor for various academic subjects (certified by the Canadian university I graduated from). I’m beginner to private tutoring, and I recently posted a Craigslist ad for $30 CAD/hour (online tutoring and NOT in-person, due to COVID).

I haven’t specified any options for session-length in my ad. I’ve so far only indicated, “$30 CAD per hour (payment currently only via Interac e-Transfer or PayPal, due to the coronavirus pandemic and lack of in-person meeting).” (I just thought I might earn more money if prospective students inquired about session length, where I might have them inclined to pay for more session time, given the open-endedness of the conversation and choice of session length. At the end of the day, I am trying to earn money, right?)

So far, interested students have generally been unsure how long they want their sessions to be. Popular consensus seems to be along the lines of, “I’d like to decide, along the way, how much more time I’d need during the sessions, because I’m not sure yet. Can I let you know as the session plays out, and then pay afterwards?”

I was just worried that with no formal legal protections in place (since this is a private tutoring side job on Craigslist), students may not pay after the session and ghost me (cutting off contact). 

I also don’t want to seem untrusting of them either, or ask them to decide on a session length ahead of time so that they can pay ahead of time (because I want to maximize session length where possible); so, I’m not quite sure how to approach this.

In most cases, the only details I have are their first and last names, and their email address (I usually get these once we’ve confirmed their interest to actually commit to a session). I also have their phone number they’ve texted me from (if it’s not a burner number). I would also know what their face looks like since I’m using video-conferencing software for the sessions.

What they know about me: My first/last names, my email address (I’m reusing my valid university email address which still works fine), and my face due to the webcam during sessions. I actually use a burner number (which is where they contact me in the first place; email is my secondary option) which isn’t tied to me.

How can I protect against tutoring and potentially not being paid by students in my situation? (I realize I may have included lots of extraneous information in this post as well! Lol.)

Thanks in advance."

lyrasorial	2021-01-09 15:29:21+00:00	How to teach unofficial sex ed in the age of Zoom school?	"Hi! I'm filling in for a middle school science teacher on leave during their genetics and reproduction unit. Our students are legally required to have a sex ed course during health class but our school doesn't have a health class so it normally falls on the science teacher during this unit. Their prior strategy was to do an anonymous question box weekly, so they could say ""I was just answering a question!"" Parents aren't always comfortable thinking of their teens as sexual beings, but that's why sex ed needs to be in schools in the first place.

I completely agree with this strategy but I'm worried about doing it digitally. I'm worried their parents might hear me talking about sex when they wouldn't expect it as part of the curriculum (again, even though it's legally part of the curriculum). Although it's a public school in a liberal area, some of our parents are conservative. In person, you can just close the door and say what you need to directly to the kids but now there's a chance I'll be recorded or a parent will disagree with me educating their child on the topic.

Also, in the past if a kid revealed something we need to mandatory report, we could do hand writing analysis to figure out who asked. But if I do a proper anonymous question online, I won't be able to do that. On the other hand, if it isn't anonymous, the students won't ask the questions they need to, and the unit won't be as helpful. 

This is the only sex ed the kids get, and I'm all for preventing teen pregnancies so I really want this to work out. Any tips for how to handle zoom school sex-ed and/or the question box? Thanks!"

JennShimmer	2021-01-09 00:16:19+00:00	Tutoring until midnight?!	"I am a Reddit lurker so please excuse any awkwardness that may be in my post.

Here’s a little (unnecessary) background information: I am an elementary special education teacher so I tend to have close relationships with the parents of my students. This year has been challenging for myself and my students because we started out remotely, then went to hybrid and are now back with remote instruction. Parents have been great about reaching out to me with issues and concerns. Our communication has been very helpful!

Now here’s the actually purpose of my post. Yesterday I had a team meeting with a parent to go over cognitive and academic evaluation results. Without giving any specifics, the student’s scores were neither very low or very high. Going into the meeting, I was looking forward to discuss these scores. Understandably, it can be difficult for parents to hear evaluation results when a child is performing far below grade level. 

Anyway, the parent was very unhappy with his child’s scores. He started ranting about the many things that we, as teachers, were doing wrong. THEN he went on to suggest that we do whatever we can to help his kid get caught up, even tutoring his son until midnight! 🤣 

I couldn’t respond....LOL! Oh man, TGIF!

Here’s hoping your week was less crazy than mine!"

There is a significant difference in the academic rigor between where I teach and my daughter’s school however I feel that she is being expected to complete a ridiculous amount of work while learning virtually. I am home currently on maternity leave so I am able to work with her on her school work but it feels developmentally inappropriate to me. She is being given 8 different lessons/assignments on google classroom each day that are taking us 7-8 HOURS to complete. This is largely without breaks and often includes her eating lunch and snack while working. My daughter needs a lot of redirection during these lessons and a lot of assistance from me having to reexplain what she is being asked to do, etc. I have ADD and see traits of it in her, however is that the problem or the school work? She is struggling and so am I. Having a baby around is definitely not helping but it doesn’t seem appropriate to me how much is being expected of a six year old learning at home. And I’m a damn teacher! I can’t imagine how difficult things would be if she was with a grandparent or a parent who was also trying to work full time from home. We literally sit and work in silence (no tv in the other room, too distracting for her) ALL day with nothing but her google classroom videos and the baby crying and us.

I taught abroad for some language training centers and online. I was making about $3600 a month with just the language center alone. It’s not licensed teaching but you get a classroom full of consistent kids and classroom management is important and you follow a curriculum so the jobs are similar. 

I come back to the US and I find this program for getting my Masters. Here is some of the ridiculous bullshit I’m seeing:

1. You PAY for a 6-8 week unpaid training program that runs from 8-5 every day. Why the fuck.

2. They accepted me into the program without ever having a phone conversation or face to face/virtual meeting with me. Why the fuck.

3. You PAY for your degree, take classes part time, and work full time in an at-risk school where risk of burn out for first year teachers extremely high if you don’t manage yourself well.

Why the fuck does this company suck the life out of its teachers, yet portray the message that they’re helping at risk schools by sending these broke teachers into their schools? 

And then once you’re teaching, you’ll be making about $40000 a year, which is about what I’m making teaching online where I don’t have to put up with bullshit from admin nor issues that students or parents bring from their home life. Plus, I clock in, teach my classes, and clock out, whereas with this, I’d see myself burdened beyond belief trying to manage a seemingly impossible case load for shit pay.

Who does this program? Why do you undervalue teaching as a profession as to let programs like this continue on by participating in them?"

I hope you're enjoying your Friday; I just wanted to post seeking some advice for a newly graduated teacher and their job hunt for a full-time teaching position. To give some background, I recently graduated with a BA in English Education for the secondary level. Recently I got a job as a classroom monitor for one of the districts around where I live, although this is a nice position with not much stress and decent pay, I continue to wonder if I could be doing more. I went on facebook today and noticed a lot of my colleagues and friends from college already found full-time teaching positions around me, leaving me with lots of anxiety and stress while feeling like I am falling behind or not working hard enough. As I begin my new position as a monitor, I continue to wonder if this job will offer me the experience I need to continue my career and path forward toward my own classroom. As a recent grad who became licensed half-way through the year, I feel as if no schools I'm applying to are hiring or even looking for teachers at the moment; all of the positions they offered were either subbing positions or monitoring positions. Although I am excited for my friends and the opportunity to monitor in a district, I feel as if I am wasting time/experience and not utilizing my degree to its fullest potential. Can anyone share any insight or advice they had throughout their job search and path towards teaching full-time? Just curious about your own journeys towards your positions and careers."

They're very talkative, rarely respond to any positive or negative reinforcement, and don't seem to think rules apply to them. After having had close contact with someone with COVID, I've had to be out all week and part of next week. After three days in my classroom, my sub went to my principal and said she didn't know if she could come back tomorrow because the kids are so disrespectful and never listen to her.

I feel awful. I know I have a hard class, but I know I've also exacerbated the issue- I've been available to my students on Google Meet all day every day to help them if they need it because, as I am not sick, I feel like I SHOULD be doing something, and ultimately it seems to have undermined the sub somewhat. To be fair, it would have been a shitshow even without me making it worse, but I'm sick thinking that this poor sub is so defeated because of me and my misbehaved students.

I'm not getting on Google Meets tomorrow or for the rest of the time I will be out, the principal and vice principal will be dropping in my class tomorrow to remind my students of expectations and make sure they're not being disrespectful. But does anyone have any advice on what more I can do to make this right for my guest teacher? I almost want to write a letter, but I'm not sure how I would phrase it...

I teach all of the subjects to a Grade 4 (9/10 years old) class.
However, the subject I am currently struggling to find any ideas/resources/inspiration for is drama!

Have any of you been teaching drama to this age group in video/online lessons? Any tips? Ideas? 

Thanks!"

Is there any way I can become an art teacher at this point? I am willing to go back to school if necessary, I just need to know what I should do next. My college advisors are useless and I am a first gen college student w/ no one to go to for advice, thats why I am having this issue :(."

I’m interrupting your regularly scheduled scrolling through posts about the coup attempt by Trump-worshipping terrorists to share a bit of positive news!

I’m a reading specialist and I teach K-5. We started our mid-year DIBELS testing this week (I know, I know, not my favorite measure of reading ability either) and I’ve been testing 3rd-5th grade including my reading support students. They actually made so much growth from September to now! One of my favorite kiddos, a 5th grader from India, especially improved. She came to us in 2nd or 3rd grade I think, and mom and dad speak mostly Hindi at home. I worked with her last year, and she was just stuck in the same place, barely making growth. Then this year, something clicked.

This rockstar of a child punched through that language barrier she struggled with and went from her words correct per minute being borderline intensive in September, to ON GRADE LEVEL yesterday! I’m only in my 2nd year teaching, so I still feel like an imposter and I feel like I can’t take any credit, even though I can.

I’m elated and I adore her. Also, a 3rd grader I work with gave me a sweet ceramic travel thermos, so it’s been a good day!"

I can't help but think about how much easier teaching in the classroom will feel to all of us once remote learning is over. My school *is* planning to return to in-person learning by the end of January (based in Denver, CO)! Although, with so many constant changes I feel that may not happen.

Anyway, I'm so eager to return, whenever that is. What have your experiences in the physical classroom (during these weird times) been like? Is it still tough to deal with?"

I would appreciate it if you could talk on the following questions and tell me a little about the way you teach so I can better improve.

1. How do you currently teach them how to 3D print? Where do students struggle?
2. Do you teach them 3D Modeling? Where do students struggle with this?
3. If you are in remote learning, how do you show them the technology or teach them about it? 

Thank you in advance, I really do appreciate your time!"

I just need some words of advice from people who understand where I’m coming from. A little background, I work in a small k-12 district. We have a k-6 building and a 7-12 building. Each grade has roughly 50 Students. This is my third year teaching freshman English, 4 year overall. Last year I loved my job with everything I had; I truly thought I had my life planned out and started working on my masters in curriculum design. This year has completely broken me. Despite living in a county with one of the highest transmission rates in the state my school district decided we would go back hybrid in person. We were the only district in the county that started in person. We were told we would not go 4 days a week because our classroom numbers would be too high and no one would be able to social distance (we were barely social distanced going hybrid).  Two weeks after that we were pretty much told to get over it and we were going 4 days a week. No one was given the option to teach remotely no matter their circumstances. We had teachers who are high risk health wise and pregnant who have been teaching since august. We had 3 outbreaks after going 4 days a week and each time they brought us back immediately after a week of quarantine ( this is not following cdc guidelines for quarantining at the time). Then, they allowed students who were fully remote to return to school making our class sizes even larger. When students chose to go remote they agreed to be remote until the end of first semester. Two weeks later they allowed more students to return. 

We had a larger number of failures than usual ( 12 kids failed freshman classes and 10 of them were fully remote all semester). So they decided to change our master schedule for second semester to accommodate failures. We are now teaching 1st semester classes again, but those kids who are repeating first semester English 1 are also taking second semester of English 1. They made our class sizes even larger and I was told I will be teaching a class I have never taught before with two weeks notice. They did however create a fully remote class which I thought was a great idea because parents kept yelling at me for not paying enough attention to remote students. It’s very hard and I am doing my best. My principal assured me that no in person students would be in my remote only class. That was yesterday, and today I was told a bunch of in person students will be in my remote class. I have 27 students in that class. I feel truly broken by this profession. Almost every Sunday I cry at the thought of going to school on Monday and I am having panic attacks in the morning and driving to work. I don’t know what to do to get me through this year. May seems so far away and I just don’t know how to make it to that point. Please any advice is welcome. 

I feel so alone right now."

therealchrestomanci	2021-01-05 23:56:23+00:00	Student with a stutter: did I do the wrong thing?	"Hello. I've just begun teaching a writing class for adults in which I asked adult students to read a few sentences of their work aloud. I made it clear this was optional. 

One of my students has a pronounced stutter, and tried a few times to read his work aloud before he gave up, seeming defeated, and said, ""I think I just won't read it.""

I asked him in front of the class: ""Do you mind if I read it instead?"" and he agreed. 

I'm now worried this was in some way impolite as it may have marked him out as ""different"" to the rest of the class. He's been fine speaking in class ever since.

In future, should I avoid ""stepping in"" if the student is unable to read out his own work? Or is this an individual matter which is best discussed in private with him?"

"Say a PSA was made to help shed light on what it is like teaching in public schools (or maybe charter too), with the intent of helping people understand how their votes an their parental or local involvement effect education as well as how they can use their votes or involvement to support teachers in providing the best possible education for the comunity, what would you as a teacher want to see in such a PSA? 

I got into education not just to teach (art and drama) but to help fix problems like those that would have seen myself, as an ADHD, dyslexic, twice gifted student, fail out of high school were I not lucky enogh to afford a private school. I thought this might lead to politics one day, but as I am also an artist, film may be a more effective route."

STEMforall	2021-01-05 17:17:56+00:00	Please review your salary schedule yearly! You might be missing out on a lot of money	"I'll use a salary schedule near me in SoCal. [This is the salary schedule](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1593153031/losalorg/ab6qmwjs77xzsn0ia3st/18-19Certificated-Reopener.pdf). 

I was recently talking to a coworker who has a year more of teaching experience as me and she found my salary on a public database and was wondering how I made 20k+ more than she did. she currently had a bachelor's degree and a masters degree with 30 units. Her salary was around $76,886 with 7 years of teaching. 

I was making around $105k because I had content/department work stipends. However, with 6 years of experience and a BA+60 &amp; Masters, I'd be making more than her without any extra work at $85,731. 

She's now enrolled in WGU to get those remaining 30 units because if she spends 5k-10k more on 30 units, her salary would immediately bump $12,000 just by topping out the pay scale. She didn't realize this because she didn't look at the salary schedule since she got hired. Back then, it wasn't worth getting the extra 30 units because the pay bump wasn't as large, but now it is.

So... just a reminder to check your salary schedule because you might be only 15 units, or an extra certification away from a larger pay bump. But then again, I understand that this is specific to state and district, so double check if it's been a while :)"

I have to say I’m really struggling here. I’m 24. In my 3rd year. Teaching a new grade level amidst the pandemic has been challenging enough but now I’m finding that I’m being over exerted at work to be barely scraping by in regards to my finances. I work two other jobs on top of full time teaching and I’m always so so exhausted. I live what I do, and I’ve dreamt of this my whole life but I’m really starting to think that I need out. I can’t sleep, I eat once a day, I’m always up planning or grading or worrying, and even then I still don’t feel like I’m ever doing a good enough job. I feel like I’m working so hard and just not seeing the fruit of it. Ever. And I don’t need recognition, or acknowledgements, or awards or anything but this is just feeling like a profession where everyone gets to just use you up, even when you have nothing left. 

I guess I’m just torn. I’m not sure where to turn. Is it the pandemic exacerbating issues that were already present in education so we are just really feeling it? Is this something I need to give up? This all terrifies me because I really have committed to this and I’m just really scared and feeling really lost. I hope this makes sense. Looking for any words of advice, encouragement, or anything.

I was considering applying for teacher training in the UK as a its shorter and hence cheaper than doing it in Ireland, and B. I have always wanted to move away from Ireland, I might as well do it now whilst I'm in my, admittedly late, 20s. The UK seems to have so many other options compared to Ireland where the PME is just a 2 year course you pay to do. I've seen options on tuition free traineeships, salaried traineeships, doing it at Uni, and tbh I'm so confused and cannot make head nor tail of it. 

I had a look at the university of oxford, I know I would never be accepted there I just decided to have a look as I visited it during my UG for a college competition, and the fees were like 10k in pounds, but then when I hit the apply via UCAS button all those other options appeared, I clicked one but they said the program was suspended-the salaried option, so I'm just confused. Could someone do like a crash course and just tell me what the option are and what the best option might be? Getting paid vs splashing out 10k on fees sounds like an obvious choice :P I would be looking to teach science/biology at 2nd level. Can I avail of bursaries or financial aid as an Irish national-I realise that's probably a question more aligned with Brexit but if anyone knows it would be appreciated, Irish students still qualify for home fees in the UK."

I had been actively searching for a full-time position since then and was a substitute teacher full-time for two years.  I have had multiple interviews and I had a few job offers, mostly areas that I could not afford to live like San Francisco.  

Finally I landed a full-time position right before the pandemic in the E Bay CA. and though it was in a demographic that had a high cost of living the pay scale was pretty decent so I accepted and moved for the position, but I still had to have a second job on the weekends because I had a lot of moving expenses from moving there for the job. 

I was a midyear hire and I only worked for two months before I was  terminated without cause.  I’ll never know why I was released but it was two weeks before the shelter in place order back in March.  I was represented by the union and they gave me a lawyer who really said I had no recourse because I was a temporary status. She also said it was a terrible district. 

I moved our of the area right after I was fired and struggled on unemployment among other issues like getting really sick. 

Anyway fast forward now to nearly 11 months later and I feel like I’m going to give up on teaching altogether. I’ve been through so much this past year. I’m currently working in my other field, hospitality  (but I’m prescribed furloughed for the second time this year ) and which I’ve been trying to get out of due to repetitive injuries (dual licensed esthetician and massage therapist )     which is why I became a teacher. 

Also my preliminary credential
expires on June 2021. I can apply for an extension. 

My content area is Art- single subject. I know this is a very competitive position and there are not many jobs  out there but I’m not sure what to do ! Should I leave teaching entirely or maybe pursue something else entirely ? Im very depressed and feeling hopeless. 
I’m just really at a loss and if any of you could give me any advice or if you’ve ever been through this experience I would love to hear anything at all. 

Thanks a lot"

I’m considering moving to the NYC area this summer to obtain an advanced certification in Early Childhood Special Ed from one of the colleges down there. I’d still need to work at least part-time while taking classes, and was considering teaching in a learning pod and/or tutoring situation. I would be in the NYC area from summer ‘21-‘22. 

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of teaching? I figured it would be a lot more flexible than being tied down in a classroom or online for most of the day while I’m managing classes.

Also for some background knowledge: I have my Bachelor’s in Early Childhood and Childhood Ed, and my Masters in Reading and Literacy. I currently teach Kindergarten in-person at a private school in upstate NY. We’re 100% in-person, so I’m comfortable with teaching in-person as long as all parties are masked and numbers are low (I only have 11 kiddos this year)."

So, I have this student who seems like he's constantly angry. He keeps getting into fights/ arguments with other students and doing and saying things that are not okay. 

The problem is that when I try to talk with him, he just gets really defensive. He blames everyone else,  and doesen't take responsibility for his own actions and words. Of course I'm aware that other students might have done things that are not okay also, and of course I talk with them as well. I always ask what happened, who did what, I understand that you got angry, but you can't kick/hit/ say bad words. I tell him to say stop, go away, find an adult... Sometimes he says that there were no adults nearby, when clearly it was. So he chooses not to follow my tips about what to do when he can't solve a conflict on his own. 

When I talk with him, he sometimes tries to walk away, gets angry, doesen't really manage to explain what happened. Just says that ""Bob is an idiot, he did this and that, so he is just a fucking idiot"". If I finally get him to explain exactly what happened, I ask him what he could have done differently... He just says ""i dont know/ nothing"", or just says that he did the right thing by kicking/ saying bad words, because Bob or whoever it was started it, and they're an idiot. 
If I give him suggestions about how to solve similar problems the next time, he just finds excuses about how impossible it is to follow my suggestions. He just dont want to listen. It's like talking to a wall. 

I have called home, but he hasn't really improved. He was beeing a bit disrespectful towards me in the beginning of the school year (august). I called home a couple of times, and things improved. But now he is letting his anger(?) out on some of the other students. And some of the other students gets really hurt about what he is doing and saying. 

Any tips?
The kids are 9-10 years old. 

I haven't worked many years as a teacher, so I'm not that experienced."

Could be that I don’t have to worry about classroom setup, or the new age group, or maybe this is my first work environment that doesn’t feel toxic.  
If you’re an elementary music teacher, I’d love to hear your wisdom (especially if it’s distance learning related!).  Good luck in 2021 everybody!"

I am upset because nobody had said anything to me until this evening and I have no idea as to what online learning entails. I have had a group of 10 preschool age children and they are currently learning in person. I have very little experience working in Kinder and was looking for any activity ideas I could do with the kinder children online. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

WelshDionysus	2021-01-03 12:57:57+00:00	I’m a lazy teacher looking for even more time off	"Okay! I confess it! I’m just lazy!

In the UK right now, there are a lot of crafty people arguing that schools should temporarily close due to covid. These cunning teachers have concocted the brilliant lie that schools are ‘unsafe’ and that there’s ‘no PPE’ or ‘social distancing’. Unfortunately for us, a number of keen-eyed Twitter experts have seen through our lies.

It’s remarkable that despite never working in a school themselves, they have managed to deduce that schools are actually 100% safe. That hundreds of kids jumping on each other at playtime and then going home to their parents and grandparents doesn’t actually put anyone at risk after all!

I thought that when the independent scientific bodies came out and stated that schools are one of the biggest transmitters for the virus which has spiralled rapidly out of control due to government inaction over the past few months, we had them. But alas! They’ve seen through our efforts.

The jig is up comrades. Those fumbling fucking fuckwits have seen through us. I don’t know how these people who don’t work in schools managed to find out our secret that we actually spend the holidays sipping pina coladas while all the marking, planning and lesson prep magically does itself but I confess it to be all true!

I’m ready to admit that it isn’t the case that I’ve very reluctantly come to the view that schools should shut because they’re unsafe and care about the kids’ and their families’ safeties. I’m just fucking lazy and don’t want to work. 

Obviously.

I can only hope they don’t also uncover the secret about how we all go home at 3pm and watch TV all evening before waking up at 8:45 ready for the next day of non-work."

I also have my own kids in my district and don't feel safe giving it to them just yet.
 Not that anything is set in stone yet, but I'm having this debate with people left and right stating ""I have no choice"". They may be right, but I don't like, as an American, not having a choice.

Since fall, thousands of people from around the world have called the Just Scream line and recorded themselves screaming. The line will be open until January 21, and I want to give teachers a chance to share how they're feeling in this strange year.

Here's how to share your teacher scream with the world:

1. Call 561-567-8431. Don't worry, there's no live human on the other end of the line!
2. Wait for the beep, then scream! Make sure to say you're a teacher so I can put your recording in a new collection of submissions from teachers.
3. Hang up when you're done.
4. Check back in 1-2 days to hear your recording [here] (https://justscream.baby/listen).

## Tips

* Start your recording with something like, ""Hi, I'm a teacher in (place)..."" or ""This is (first name) from (place), and I teach (grade/subject)...
* Please don't share full names or the name of your school.
* Follow this project on Instagram or Facebook at @justscream.baby
* Share with your colleagues, friends, and family but not students!"

I’m starting to think no one is. There’s too much. I feel like there is not enough time in the day to fill their emotional needs and academic needs and grade and individualize lessons and tests and the list goes on. I have been fantasizing being a nanny. I’d still be with kids and make the same money (if not better) and just lose the benefits and retirement. I’ve been trying really hard to allow myself to remember I can pick it up again later in life and to just finish out this year but part of me also thinks who cares if I don’t.. maybe whoever fills my place might stand a better chance of helping them get to 4th grade. They are sooo low. And they do nottt care and I don’t know how to make them. I don’t know how to keep the mindset I had of helping my struggling kids prove everyone else wrong when it’s starting to seem like they’re not ever going to. I didn’t want to be the teacher who thought that way. I don’t think I’m cut out for this... and then there’s little moments that make me feel like I 100% am meant for this but I don’t think those moments outweigh everything else. I don’t know how bad it looks to quit mid year or to leave teaching and come back with nannying on my resume idkkkk what to do!!

My question is about visible tattoos in the workplace, and more specifically ones focused on children’s literature. The Little Prince has been a very special book to me for about the last 10 years. It means a lot to me personally, but it has also impacted my teaching philosophy. I really (really) want to get the tattoo pictured below in the comments, in a similar size and location. I want it to be visible because it is important to me. But I also care deeply about my job and I don’t want to mess up future prospects. Do you think tattoos like this one are suitable for an elementary school environment? For context, I teach Kindergarten. My current school allows tattoos (I know teachers with full sleeves) but I will be moving next year and I am scared that future schools will not want to hire me with a visible tattoo, even if it has to do with children’s literature.

I get very tired of hearing my coworkers and other teacher on reddit whine about the profession... I think it's very undignified/unprofessional and sets a terrible example for new teachers and students.  My only conclusion for this whining is that many teachers have never had other professions other than teaching and have never experienced the real stress one can experience while working in industry, military or college acadamia.

I need help. 

I started at a Private School when my former job did some layoffs due to covid. I got great vibes from the school, it made so many promises to keep me safe, discussed all the facilities and small class sizes -12 per class, teaching only 4 classes a day with some additional duties.

Well, the beginning of the year, I was put inside a house with 50 kids, 8 adults and told to separate. I taught outside in the rain with students and not teaching meant I was in charge of all recess and lunch duties when the rest of staff got breaks. We couldn't have kids sit in chairs, no desks, no internet, no printer and literally I had them copy things in notebook from a whiteboard like the 1 house schoolroom situation I was in. I shared a bathroom with all the kids because, it was a house, and it often was broken from overuse. The situation was unsafe, and it made me look for other employment, especially when we lost 3 teachers.

I have been interviewing at this other school for 1 month now, and though I started at this schoolhouse nightmare, they finally found a new place for us to go to, in a school that is being remote for the year. It has been so much better and resources and furniture makes it into a real school. I kept interviewing with this other school which has a good reputation but I'm finally feeling content being at my employment.

However, this is where I need help. The new school offered me a position with more money and want me to start in 5 days. I am nervous to switch midyear, thinking of resume and knowing the kids, but I was lied to in the beginning of the year and I am mad still I was put through all that. I need to give an answer by tomorrow and I already asked if I could give a proper 2 weeks and they can't afford to give me that. This raises red flags as well. I'm having serious trust issues with schools and need some perspective. Please help."

For one, I'd love to be there for youth and go beyond in a classroom setting. In short, I'd love to become the sort of teacher I needed as a teenager.

To be honest, I was never quite certain about my career goals and went to college for my parents. That being said, it was a pleasant experience! I've learned a lot and I've made wonderful connections with people from all walks of life. I'm an English major, mainly because it was the only subject I enjoyed all throughout grade school. I'll be graduating with my BA in English this coming spring. 

I did some reading for my state (Nevada) and I'm a bit confused. I know one of my options is to pursue a master's degree and get my licensure with it. I know it varies by state, but is a master's degree mandatory in order to teach? 

After doing some research, I also read that licenses can expire (anywhere from 3-5 years) and that has me questioning what I'd be doing after it expires. I guess what I'm trying to say here is, I'm a little overwhelmed by the process and I'd love some advice/feedback from the more experienced folks on this subreddit. Thanks in advance!"

wadeboggsbosshoggs	2020-12-28 16:22:50+00:00	How to have fun and be fun?	"So I’ve been teaching for 3 years now.  I’m very academic and love my books and everything English related.  I love reading and writing and academia as a whole.  But I’m also a middle school ELA teacher.

My curriculum is fairy scripted and the lessons are straightforward reading strategies.  I teach the 10 minute mini-lesson and then kids read for 30 mins while I conference with each one and offer reading strategies, etc. 

Problem is, I’m a pretty serious guy.  At home and around others I’m really, really comfortable with, I can let loose.  I’m usually snarky, witty, and sometimes crude with my humor.  This doesn’t translate well for 12 year old children.

I’m finding my days to be very predictable.  Teach the lesson, conference.  Rinse, repeat.  It’s boring the hell out of me.  I teach a scripted lesson and then ask a kid why they aren’t reading at home or why they aren’t doing their journal and my days over.  5 periods a day, same shit.

I want to have fun and enjoy my work and enjoy the kids.  As soon as I start teaching their eyes glaze over.  I have energy and I talk to them very passionately about my lesson.  It’s not like I’m standing there droning on for 45 minutes.  My lesson is 10 mins, quick and easy.  Problem is, none of them listen or give a rats ass.  We are standard based grading so they don’t care if they get a “below basic” on their report card.  

I feel like they all just come to school and humor me by listening to me talk for 10 minutes and they read at school, but it’s so boring and draining.

I can’t really deviate from the curriculum or offer fun activities, my department head is up our ass making sure we do everything by the book and all teach the same lesson at the same time.  

When I taught HS (my first year) I was able to connect with the kids and have more fun with them.  But these MS children are so strange.  

Sorry, this is like 10 different issues wrapped up into one giant post.  

TLDR; teaching isn’t fun for me anymore, it’s boring and predictable and feeling stale.  Need to mix things up and have fun with the kids.  How to keep them more engaged without changing my personality or reading some asinine book like “Teach Like a Pirate.”

Thanks and enjoy what’s left of our break!"

Whether the groups are based on race, sexuality, or disability, there are stigmas associated with people who are different, and games can help students broaden their perspective on sensitive topics like these. For example, a game could use simulated scenarios where students interact with individuals from certain marginalized groups, and through mutual interests or shared experiences, students would discover that what connects us as people is greater than what separates us. Who would find this most useful? I may build a game on this topic if there's enough interest in it."

My center has had to cut a lot of hours recently due to Covid. My students have had 2 other teachers this year before me. Once, the director came into my classroom and told me, at 11 AM, that I’d be going home early that day because they’d just crunched the numbers and it was my turn to be on the chopping block that week. Last Monday I showed up to work only to be told I’d have the week off, and I had to say goodbye to a kid that had already arrived for the school day. 

It’s frustrating. I want to be a reliable figure in these kids’ lives in such an unreliable and tumultuous time. They have so little that they can count on right now and I want them to know I am here for them. Communication at my center is abysmal, though. There are considerable language barriers and the place makes it a point to use minimal technology. 

I just want to be able to show my students that I’m here for them. Attachment means so much to kids. What are some ways I can do this even during these times?"

Does anyone know what my options are for getting a PEL or something comparable? Do I need to enter a masters program? I’ve tried to do my research but the info is a little convoluted."

I'm 29 years old and I'm looking for advice on the best path to take to become a special education teacher in NY. I received a BS in Psychology from Stony Brook University. I taught English in South Korea and continued to teach English online to kids in China. I've worked with the ID/D population for the last 4 years. I struggled for a few years and finally feel passionate towards a career path. All advice is appreciated ❤️"

I like the idea of being a cop, majoring in psychology, or majoring in physical education. If I majored on Physical Education, I would get my health teacher certs as well. How hard is it to find a Health or Physical Education teaching job? Also, what’s the outlook on them?"

This could be either with your AZ/DC license from Teach-Now or with a FL license from Teacher Ready?

That or were you able to apply for a license with another state after getting one of the above licenses so you could teach for an online school in that state?"
mars888999	2020-12-25 06:13:20+00:00	Best recommendations for teaching abroad?	"It has been a dream of mine to live abroad and even though covid is making everything uncertain I still really want to do it! I also feel like it is something I need to do to get out of the rut I'm stuck in and I do want to travel!

I'm a relatively new grad and this is my third year of teaching. I had already been looking into teaching abroad and earlier this year I started to apply to work in Australia. I thought this would be a good fit for me as it's an English speaking country, I could still do all my hobbies, I like an active lifestyle, and even though it is mostly sub work so I may not make a ton (but tbh still more than where I currently live!) I would have opportunity for flexibility. 

However, I got a contract in my desired subject area so I put that idea on hold and then covid happened so I guess it was a good thing. My contract is ending soon and I feel uncertain about teaching during a pandemic here. Australia is pretty much back to normal but now you have to pay 3k to live in a hotel for 2 weeks!

I started looking into other opportunities in China, the UAE, Asia, and Europe. Lots with competitive salaries and who also provide housing, flights, visas, meals etc! However, after looking at a bunch of reviews for China and the UAE it seems like a lot would suck to work there!

Right now I think I would like the UAE, Shanghai, South Korea (I studied abroad there and do like it!), or perhaps somewhere in Europe though it doesn't look like there are a ton of opportunities. I would prefer to work in my subject area but I would also look into teaching English. 

Does anyone have any recommendations or advice as to where to work? I still feel like I would love Australia but with covid who knows when I could go over there and the 3k extra expense is a lot."

I know I have to get a certain amount of PD hours to keep my teaching license. How do you find time to get these hours? Do you automatically get them after attending all the meetings the school tells you about? Or do you do it all on your own time and figure it out?"

I have a general idea of which programs I am applying to and am in the process of getting the materials together to apply. However, my question is **for those who have done part-time graduate programs, what is the one thing you wish you knew before starting, or what is your advice?**

My goal is to be a professor and work in museums but I want to stay a teacher so that I can actually be an effective professor (I am sure we all know the professors who are brilliant but can't teach), which is why I plan on only going part-time.

Thank you and hopefully you are all enjoying your break!"
KitchenAvenger	2020-12-24 17:46:23+00:00	Am I within my rights or should I suck it up and do what my admin wants?	"Some background: I went to school for secondary ed, tried teaching, felt overwhelmed and unsupported, and since then I've opted for assistant positions instead. I enjoy being in a supporting role.

I applied for an assistant position with a kindergarten this fall. We have smaller class sizes so that we can continue to operate in person, and we do a deep clean every afternoon. Now my lead teacher is leaving for a new position (we had a rough time with some staff cuts and there was some tension between teachers and the board, so she applied for other jobs and was accepted). My director wants me to take over as the lead teacher. I do not want this position. I don't want to work 60 hours a week; I've got a small home business that I enjoy and I also enjoy my free time at home. I've been the lead teacher before and did not enjoy the seemingly endless planning at home (and my spouse did not enjoy it either). 

I told my director that I would be willing to stay on as the assistant, and I will teach the class until she hires a lead teacher, but if no one has been hired by Feb 1st I'm going to start sending homework with kids to ease some of my own workload (currently we don't send homework).

My director doesn't understand why I wouldn't want the position, even though I've explained my reasons to her. Her reaction makes me feel as though I'm being selfish and I should suck it up for the kids. But this isn't what I applied for.

On top of everything, my director wants me to schedule a zoom meeting with parents before we return from break, presumably to explain the situation. She has told me that she has already spoken to some parents and that parents are confused as to why I am not taking over as lead teacher, so I guess I will have to explain myself to the parents at the meeting (something which I am not looking forward to).

What should I do? Am I within my rights to stand my ground or should I ""get over myself?"""

doglover2525	2020-12-23 18:46:14+00:00	Nervous about becoming a teacher	"I am going back to school to get my masters in early childhood/elementary education. I got my bachelors in communication studies because I didn’t really know what I wanted to do honestly. I always wanted to work with kids but always felt I was too shy and didn’t know if I wanted to get into OT or teaching. 

I worked at a daycare after getting my bachelors and I liked it!! But now I want further my education and teach broader subjects to children. 

Now that I am thinking about going back to school, I am getting nervous. I am not the most outgoing/confident person ever so I fear it will be a struggle for me. I love children and I feel that I am empathetic and caring. 

I believe I am making the right choice, but others fear I am too shy to become a teacher. And now I am having second thoughts."
Anubis-Hound	2020-12-23 17:54:21+00:00	In the public school system I've seen so many good teachers become completely burnt out by the demands of being a teacher. What keeps you all going strong?	"Not sure if this type of post/question is allowed so forgive me mods.

From a young age I realised that teachers go through so much shit and it got worse the older I got. Every once in a while I'd ask myself what kept them from just saying ""fuck this!"" and quitting? 

Especially once I hit high school. 

And these days I'm even more confused. 

What keeps teachers from rage quitting? (Aside from ""I need a job."")"

user00067	2020-12-23 01:39:03+00:00	Is change at this stage possible to become a professor?	" 

I'm currently approaching 30 with MS in Intelligence. My ""big boy"" work experience is all related to the field of Criminal Justice, but I'm still in the process of weighing out different realities of the field. I have a couple years of experience working with children as a swim instructor while going through college where I have gotten tremendous enjoyment/fulfilment. I also personally have had professors that have made an unimaginable impact on my life.

Long story short, I know people do switch careers and others in their later stages of separate career teach a couple classes as a side gig, but as far as the reality of transitioning into something like that is that going to be a very tough change with no financial incentive or more or less doable with the right dedication?"

dcsprings	2020-12-22 01:52:23+00:00	Quizzes assess teaching except when they don't	"School policy (and I have no problem with this) says to give a quiz each week, and everyone gets a 100. Fine, no problem, I want a way to see if it's sinking in. Except I have one student (in my head he's Mr. Gortex)  knowledge beads up on the surface and rolls right off. When we were on lock down he joined the Zoom class, pointed the camera at a wall and played games (we could hear them). In class, he does the same thing in his head, he will look right at me and be completely absent. He doesn't do any homework, on exams he randomly chooses answers for multiple choice questions (I teach physics) and writes a random equation to ""show"" work. There are almost weekly parent contacts, and he's very confident (almost to the point of delusion) about graduating and going to college. I don't even need to document anything, just looking at one test tells the entire story. My problem is the quizzes, I don't want anything to suggest progress he hasn't made. I have felt my only option is to correct his quizzes but not put a grade on them (the 100 on the quizzes is a morale boost to most of the students). I don't want to give him anything that is a false mark of progress. Any suggestions?"
olivejuicemash	2020-12-21 22:17:20+00:00	"MA in Education, MA in English, or M.Ed?"	"Hi all, I'm currently in my senior year of undergrad at UCB with an English major and an Education minor. The teaching credential/M.Ed programs that are offered look really promising. I want to teach English at the high school level and possibly move onto other educational careers, such as an educational consultant or different administrative positions. Basically, I want to be able to keep my options open for working in education. I initially wanted to teach English at the community college level, but it's so competitive to get a full-time job. I am much more interested in teaching at the high school level and have the option to do more administrative work for public education from high school to community college.

Will my career options be limited if I choose one over the other? Also, if anyone has any general advice or experience they would like to share about which graduate school they chose, I would greatly appreciate it! There is so much information on the internet that it can be a tad overwhelming, thanks!!

baldArtTeacher	2020-12-18 21:02:12+00:00	I've been putting in for accomidations to work from home due to being high risk and have been offered working one day a week for the pay of insurance covreg. Am I crazy to consider taking this or is it reasonable?	"My school has been open full time in person all year. Our cases went up and we made more dangerous policy changes which, as a high risk person, crossed a safety line for my ability to teach in person. This was the point I put in for a work from home accommodation. Starting out I would have been happy to stick with leave provided I had insurance and don't mess up my career but also wanted to start negotiating from the stand point of still being remotely avalible for my students and being paid according to whatever that would look like. 

The district basicly said my insurance is $1500 a month so by working one day a week remotely they will cover that and then I can get paid like a sub if more time was needed for a particular lesson or something. I would have to get the extra time approved on a case by case basis. 

Does this seem reasonable? I'm just so supprised it's even an option that I'm not sure of it. 

P.S. I'm dislexic, sorry for any mistakes I missed, I miss more on the phone."
