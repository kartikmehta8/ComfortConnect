Muscle-Apprehensive,2021-04-30 16:35:52+00:00,Hi-lo writing resources?,"I have a little money to spend from my school, so I’m looking for a writing curriculum or resource. My needs are very specific:

- Appropriate for high schoolers at a 2nd-3rd grade reading level

- No phonics, or little enough that it can be ignored

- Does not focus on grammar

Googling has led me to saddleback, whose books I use often, but their writing book does focus a bit more heavily on grammar than I would like. I’ve been creating my own materials, and I will continue, but I would love some other resources to work from.

Do any of you have any suggestions? Writing resources you love that fit my criteria? Thanks!"
Hiren-123,2021-04-30 07:03:30+00:00,Do we deserve good teachers for our kids?,"In 1088 AD, the University of Bologne, the first University in the west, was founded. The students of the University would create groups and hire professors to teach. If students felt satisfied, they would hire and pay the professor again. If not satisfied, the verdict was no more engagement.

Students were the boss!

Gradually, good professors came together and turned the tables around.

Ironically, the student was still paying, but the recipient was the boss. Contrary to other jobs!

iammothepenguin,2021-04-29 21:59:17+00:00,Outdoor recess feud,"At the beginning of the year, we were told there should be no outdoor recess due to covid.
However, things are more relaxed now. I strongly believe every child deserves to have a time during every day to have a break and that may include going outside at least occasionally. I emailed my principal a few weeks ago about if we were allowed to go outside or not. She replied and said we can occasionally take them outside.

Today, another teacher in my grade and I took our students outside and some of the other grade level teachers were very angry because their kids saw us going outside. They said it is not fair to their kids.
Do you think I am in the wrong? Should I have not taken my kids out?
I don’t want to create a toxic community by going against another teachers wishes, however, I got approval from the principal and it is up to her if she wants to take her kids out or not.

What should I do in the future? I am a first year teacher who doesn’t want to make any other experienced teachers mad, but also need to give these kids a break."

Currently in the process of looking for teaching jobs in Brevard County FL (Central FL) and finished a set of Career Fair Interviews (2 interviews over Zoom different schools). 

Anyways got an email recently that stated those selected have been notified so I'm assuming I wasn't in that group, so I'm a little disheartened. Just curious if the odds of landing a job are still pretty good in May/June timeframe? Do more positions usually open up? I apologize for any ignorance on the matter switching careers and was recently certified to teach so very excited to get everything underway. Thanks!"
Tidbits1192,2021-04-29 13:02:42+00:00,How Many Books Do You Lose A Year?,"So last year we got kicked out of school back in March, and just before I did a catalog of all of my library books.  I am still missing 99 books from last year. I’ve asked my last years kids and keep getting variations of “I dunno” and “I don’t have anything.” I do know one person has several but every time I ask they say they’ll bring them in but never do. 

This year has been better. I’m only missing about 30.

Anyways, what’s a normal amount of books to lose in a class library and how do you handle book hoarders? I have at least two this year and one actually reads the books and the other just brings them home and doesn’t read them."

Corolla_rolla,2021-04-29 01:43:19+00:00,Long term sub and Special Ed,"I am an experienced sub and EL teacher and I have been given a large early elementary class with 3 sped students.  I have a EA who does small group activities.
  We work well together and things have been progressing.  

Every once in a while a few other EA's call out and the administration pulls my EA to go do recess and lunch. I don't see her anymore. Then I have to get creative with classroom management.  


I talked to the school resource lady, and she passed me to the principal.  I emailed the principal and he kind of shrugged and suggested I talk to the other sped teacher- the qualified one- and see if they could give me ideas how to differentiate with sped. 

It is not fair and illegal to boot. 
I asked the sped teacher and they said If my EA gets pulled I should make all the sped students go to the sped room. 



My first question is;  Should my Sped students have more qualified help than an EA? 
And second is,  what should I do? I don't want to stigmatize these students by kicking them out every time the EA is busy. I don't want to ignore them and their needs either. 
My recourse thus far has been to have high level students be my little teachers and play sight word and math fact games. 
How can I improve or work this out? The principle already suggested I try to figure out a way to manage the situation when it happens, so he seems complacent or at least apathetic.. 

Or should I just take a few sick days and forget about the whole miserable tangled mess?"
ThinkingBook2,2021-04-29 01:17:32+00:00,No Zeros?,"So.... Our district is slowly shifting to PCBL learning. We know very little about the next steps but the first step began this past fall. No more zeros, only 50%. 

We assumed this would only be for COVID, but it is a permanent measure for our district now. Teachers across the district are angry because with the particular students we teach, it becomes challenging. Students this year are already “gaming” the system and turning in minimal amounts of work to scoot by with a 60. I’m sure they are not learning much, with COVID on top of everything.

Are there any teachers out there that have PCBL in their districts? How is it going for you? Is it effective (before COVID, I guess I should say)? What are the advantages and challenges?"

I might as well be 245345243 years old because they couldn't believe it.  Some comment gems were:

ProperPolicy,2021-04-28 23:57:40+00:00,Locking Chromebooks to an app?,"Hi,

I hope this belongs in this sub. This is a question about teaching in a classroom with multiple grades, say 7, 8, and 9, and using Chromebooks.

The students have Chromebooks and for a 75 minute math block, the teacher is doing 25 minutes direct instruction for each grade. While the teacher is teaching one group, the other groups are on mathletics/prodigy/whatever (an online learning platform, or some other in person learning activity). Is there a way to lock Chromebooks to a certain website/app just for that certain time? I've heard of kiosk mode, is it the solution I'm looking for and able to just be in kiosk mode for a certain set schedule?

Thanks in advance"
eacks29,2021-04-28 22:04:27+00:00,working as an educational aide?,"hi all, I’ve currently been teaching for a few years (one as a daycare teacher and 3 as an elementary teacher in a charter school). My current job situation, the charter school, is not a good fit for me and I’d like to progress my career in a good public school district in my area. There are not many openings and a LOT of applicants in my area for full time teaching positions, but I have the opportunity to interview for an educational aide in a great district and school.

Should I go for it? I feel bad taking a pay cut and a “step back” so to speak, but I’m hopeful that getting my foot in the door as an aide will help me land a full time teaching position in this district in the future. Thoughts?"
hibyechickenpie,2021-04-28 19:07:10+00:00,Considering leaving medicine for teaching,"Usually I would post this on the medical school sub but I wanted to get the other sides advice. Throwaway bc of personal info.

Im about to finish my first year of med school and I genuinely dont enjoy it. Nor am I good at it. Its been a rough year and from the literal first day of school I have been questioning whether this was the right decision for me. I dream of quitting, moving back home, and becoming a teacher.

Some background about me: I am 21 years old living in the US. Graduated college 2 years early and went straight into med school. Majored in Neuroscience in undergrad which I loved. Never really explored anything outside of medicine since I was in a time crunch to graduate.

Reasons I'm doubting medicine:

-Cost: I have no financial support and am taking out full loans. Im expected to graduate with around 500k in debt. If I go into peds, residency pay will be about 50k/yer for 3 years. After those three years I'm looking at being paid around 100k.

-Teaching: I have always loved teaching. I've taught at a sunday school for 6 years and while I know thats different from typical teaching it has still given me some insight on the field. Kids are great and I have a great bond with them. I am planning on doing pediatrics if I continue medicine. Most parents of kids that I teach are really happy with me as a teacher and tell me their kid loves me. Ive even been reach out to by these parents in order to privately tutor their kids because of how much they like my teaching. This is not me trying to brag-I'm just letting you know my background in this field. I also feel like I would like the environment of the teaching workplace (ik some of you are cringing at this), but I always wanted to be like my teachers who were friends with the staff and did silly stuff like pep rallys.

-Location: I moved across the country for med school. I hate it. I am a very big family person and being away from my friends and family is taking a big toll on me. If I go into teaching I am sure I can find some job in my homestate.

-Time: Medicine takes forever. 4 years med school and 3 years residency (could be anywhere in the country). I am unsure I can even match into a residency (its like applying to med school all over again but worse and you little control over where you end up). Im not even sure I can successfully pass my boards. Like I have said I have been struggling majorly this first year. It all feels very uncertain.

-Lifestyle: Medicine requires you to dedicate your life to it for at least 7 years. Sure I can work part time after those but I will have loans to pay off. If we are being honest my entire goal in life is to one day raise a family of my own and be with family. Im not chasing money and in my culture the girl doesnt have to contribute to household expenses. I actually grew up poor so 50k is a lot to me. Some of you may think this is silly but this is what I've always wanted.

Those are my reasons. Being in med school away from family has made me realize that I dont really care about being rich (nor will med school get me to that point anytime soon). My worry is that I fantasize teaching too much. Of course I know it has its own problems (what job doesnt), but I feel like I would be much happier working a 9-5, doing something I like, and being near family and friends. Lol I guess you can roast me in the comments now."

I'm teaching an English language course in which the materials were provided to me at the start of the semester. Sometimes I like that, sometimes it gives me good ideas, but these materials...well, they're pretty outdated. I'm the type of person who has a strong desire to make my own materials to feel like I'm contributing something new, being innovative, putting my own ""flair"" on things. I changed a few of the exercises and the head of the department has asked me to kindly use the materials provided to me and not change anything. And it really upsets me. On the one hand I understand where he's coming from that he wants the material to be consistent between instructors, but on the other hand I like to put in that extra effort, I love to make materials ""mine"" and infuse my personality into things. Have you been in a situation like this? I'm having a hard time letting go when I see so many things that I could potentially improve."
RoswalienMath,2021-04-28 12:52:17+00:00,Why are we opening?,"My county is still the darkest color on the COVID maps. We’re at more than 10,500/100k. 

The high school 3 miles away closed this week due to a COVID outbreak. They’ve been open using the simultaneous teaching model, with students 6 feet apart, for a month. That district had multiple elementary schools closed last week for the same reason.

We got an email this morning that one of our elementary schools that opened to students 2 weeks ago is already closing temporarily due to an outbreak. 

My school is bringing back students who are in danger of failing 3-4 classes for the year May 3rd. They are bringing them back at midterm. If they’ve failed every term so far, they need a B to get their credit. If they are failing at midterm, they won’t be able to get a B. So why are we bringing them in?

We’ve had 6 positive cases with *just staff* in it my building for the last 3 weeks. 

We have a month left. Why are we putting students and staff in danger for a month of in-person-but-still-taught-like-virtual instruction? 

Close the school buildings in my county, keep everyone safe, we’ll fix it next year."
Litpunk,2021-04-28 01:43:50+00:00,Someone with an admin license and two years of teaching experience is going to.m be in charge of curriculum,"Today, my dream job in my district was posted: curriculum coordinator.  You not only get to redesign, reimplement, and retrain the staff, you also get to read about great research and brainstorm new ways to reach kids.
I probably spent an hour updating my resume, writing my letter of intent, until one of my coworkers said: ""they don't want us, we're not admin""
And sure enough, I read it again and I need an applicable admin license, which can only be gotten through Praxis AND a graduate program.

PM-ME-DOGS-PLEASE,2021-04-27 23:58:12+00:00,I don’t feel I’ve done anything to prepare kids for standardized tests.,"Please help to ease my anxiety about this. I teach 8th grade math. 

I reviewed some sample state test questions today right before leaving work and my stomach dropped. Last year was my first and our state tests were cancelled, so this is my first experience with them. I’ve been following the standards closely but upon looking at the sample questions they are way more complex than I anticipated. Several steps, multiple skills in one question, etc. Some standards also went more advanced than I realized. Some things we covered extensively that didn’t come up at all. I don’t understand: from what I’ve heard from their 9th grade teacher my kids last year were so prepared for 9th grade math, even remembered key formulas by heart. 

I can’t help but feel like I could have taught my kids better. I thought I was stretching them so much this semester and felt really proud but this has left me deflated and feeling like I’ve failed them. We switched to block scheduling so I’ve had them for half the year and for longer periods of class which, in my opinion, the extra 20 mins are useless because they don’t have the stamina to do math that long. Last semester we were mostly distance so we covered the bare minimum because so many kids did nothing at home. 

I know I could have been better, done review activities, pushed them harder, looked at practice questions sooner, used class time more but now it’s too late. Looking for ways to feel better about this from the community."

I tried to do card talks but a lot of my students didn’t really take it seriously or want to share. I “encouraged” some of them to but I could see how reluctant they were. I know it’s late in the year and that the 7th and 8th graders are basically checked out but I’d really like for it to go well and it just is feeling so overwhelming. For context the students’ original Spanish teacher had to leave halfway through and they’ve been given 2 other subs before me who didn’t speak much Spanish. I’m their first real teacher since January basically.
I’m also young so it was tough to become an authority figure to them, but I think I got that down, it’s just bonding them and getting some mutual respect. I was told to use my youth to my advantage but that wasn’t really helpful? I have no clue what to do so any ideas would be great."

emmocracy,2021-04-27 16:08:25+00:00,KWL except not,"Looking for a version of an interactive/collaborative KWL chart to use with fourth graders while we're reading a novel. 

The novel is about an Inuit boy who can't bring himself to kill a seal even though it's culturally important that he do so. My students aren't familiar with Inuit culture, but there are definitely parallels between the societal pressures the protagonist faces and those faced by my students (approx. 96% of students in my school are POC).

Anyway, for these reasons, I want to do a deep dive into Inuit culture before we start reading and find ways to make this otherwise dry (mandatory) text more engaging. 

My plan is to post a large version of the chart in the classroom and give each student a sticky note for each chapter we read or after each reading session. I want to students to have a say in what they write and to which chart they post their notes. I also want to give the system enough structure to make it useful as a kind of ongoing formative assessment.

I think I'll keep the wonder (W) and tell students to post questions they have after reading there. I'll probably keep the learn (L) and have them post new/notable info they learn there. I don't see the know (K) as being very useful throughout the whole novel, though. Thinking of changing that to a P for predictions, but that also kind of falls into questions. Although, I could see K as being useful in the beginning when I teach background info/context for the novel and it would function as a kind of anchor chart.

Should I just stick with KWL? Are there any other versions I should look into? Has anyone used this kind of system before? Help! 

Please and thank you."

I have been an in-home childcare provider for 7 years. I practice a respectful approach and collaborate with the parents (parents I CHOOSE to work with). I am currently pursing my MSTC. The last things I need to complete are: student teaching (I plan to intern), CSET, RICA, TPAs, US Constitution, renew first aid/CPR, and certificate of clearance. I just really don't want to be a teacher and completing this program just feels impossible. Being thrown in to politics, dealing with 25+ students and their parents, fulfilling all expectations of teaching, and learning what I can and can’t say/do in the classroom is just really unappealing to me. I feel helpless because what they require and expect from us is very irrational and a lot of it I believe is a money scheme. Just thinking about having to complete the CSET, RICA, and TPAs feels impossible (though I know it's not)! I haven't had to take a test of any sort for years and thinking of having to do it in a fucking pandemic just gives me anxiety. I'm thankful for all that I've learned and it's made me a better childcare provider, but for so long I've known I don't even want to be in the classroom. I wish I can find some sort of alternative because especially now (with the pandemic), I do not want to be in the classroom.

I’ve been repeatedly kicked, punched, cussed at and swore at 3 times a week if not more since January. 

I’ve also been pulled into the office multiple times because I’m too stern with said student, and I need to take more of a proactive, positive approach.

I am writing here because I have been accepted to study  at Tampere University and University of Jyväskylä, and I am indecisive about which one should I choose as my Master's degree.

Both are great universities to study but I am standing here confused and conflicted about which programme am I to accept. From Tampere University I was accepted for the European and Global Politics. From the Jyväskylä Uni I was accepted for the Development, Education and International Cooperation programme, and lastly, Languages, Intercultural Communication and Globalization.

My educational history is somewhat complex, I went to vocational school for a culinary course of three years, afterwards I took the national exams in order to be accepted into university, which came true. I have a B.A. in Translation of three years from the NOVA University of Lisbon and studied certain subjects within that programme which included the study of certain aspects of politics, economics and etc. As well as having collaborated for projects with international students.

I have always been deeply interested in the international environment and while politics is something I do not want to go for, diplomacy and migration are two things which fit me perfectly. 

I read the description of the three programmes. I want to focus in migration, diplomacy and international relations subjects. All these programmes have subtle similarities. Has anyone studied one of these programmes? If that is the case then could I get some advice? Which one offers the best quality of teaching?

Perhaps this is not the best sub to ask for advice but still

My name is Kushel Ramanayake, and I am a current 4th undergraduate at Informatics Institute of Technology affiliated with University of Westminster UK. As part of my Final Year Thesis, I am required to gather some feedback on my project. The project I have developed generates questions automatically from a text document such as a PDF. I am in need of reviewers to go over some sample questions and validate the quality of the questions generated. The reviewers need to be experts of a certain subject i.e. an English teacher will review questions generated from English subject matter.

**PROCEDURE**

You may send me a PDF document of your choice or I'll select a suitable one within the relevant domain, and I will generate the questions and send you an spreadsheet to fill. Each questions will be marked as either valid/invalid and those valid will be given a rating 1-10 to gauge the quality.

No personal information other than maybe name and occupation will be collected.

Thank you in advance,

""Next 4-5 years, the best education will reach all”, he said, fully confident.

I said in a low slightly under confident voice, “Sir, the intention behind this is awesome but, with all due respect, I see major issues which may disappoint all”.

But as expected, he seemed disinterested to listen. I happened to interact with him again a few months back, this time, I had more of his attention. It was great of the prof to listen to me, to disagree with me, to dwell further on it and then to come back after 20 odd days nodding in agreement.

VladPale,2021-04-24 11:24:56+00:00,Teachers pre-grading other teacher’s assignments,"I work in a high school that has a concurrent program with a local college. I am a professor in that program. There is another teacher that teaches the tail-end of my subject. I teach history to 1865 and they teach from 1865 to present. 

Recently, I’ve had students going to the other professor and submitting their essays to them for ‘advice’. The advice to this point has been somewhat innocent in my opinion: change the spelling of this and maybe consider citing that kinda advice.  However, yesterday I had a student that said the other professor said their work is good and should get an A and that I only have a master’s and they have a PhD. 

I feel that this is a dangerous road to go down because despite the fact that only two students have gone to the other professor thus far it is going to increase. I also think if I were to look at that paper now and give it anything less than an A that the student would feel empowered to challenge my grading. I asked my principal to meet over this and directly asked the other teacher to stop giving students advice on my assignments. 

Have any of you encountered this before and how did you handle it?  Did it get worse like I think it will?  What are your thoughts on other teachers agreeing to meet with your students to look at their work before it is due?  Am I making a bigger deal out of this than it is?"

Lorriie,2021-04-22 23:36:10+00:00,Covid elementary recess ideas?,"Has anybody got any games a group of students can play at recess? Due to covid we can’t play with playground equipment (balls and jump ropes etc) but we do have access to a big toy. 

The class is about 10 students between K/1st and 4th/5th grade, special needs but socially they are playing at about a 2nd grade level collectively. The playground does not have a large open area to run around in. 

One of the biggest issues is making sure the game is “fair” for everyone (obviously the older students give allowances for the younger ones, but they are hard on each other and haven’t had much peer interaction in a year, so conflicts escalate very quickly over minor issues. We’ve had to ban tag because it was getting too rough and they kept saying people were “cheating” (?) for example

Because of the huge age gap anything competitive is rough to do because obviously the 1st graders can’t keep up

We played “four corners” today which is basically all the kids run to the four corners of the playground (that an adult numbered) and the person who is “it” closes their eyes and counts to ten then calls out a number 1-4 and anyone in that corner is “out”, until there’s only one left. Which went okay, but I don’t think there’s much longevity in it, 

so I’m basically looking for contact-free easy to explain games, does anyone have any ideas? Or what are your kids playing in covid recess? Because we are sped we are at school all day

I constantly have to speak over them to get their attention and today was the absolute worst it’s ever been. I’m a first year teacher and this is a semester long course, in my other classes the relationship building aspect has always been my go-to for classroom management and it’s worked but not this one. 

I’ll admit I’m a pretty laid back teacher, I let students listen to music while working, if a student slips a cuss word I let it slide, I don’t deny bathroom breaks, I let them work together on assignments and (so far) this has all led to students really respecting the classroom and abiding by the rules. However, it’s clear that this class has decided that the small amount of freedom I give means there are no repercussions. That combined with COVID burnout and the general sense that they all think this year doesn’t count has put me at the point to where I need to decide to come down on them or if I just need to survive."

I constantly overexplain things, or I can't explain things well because I'll be in the middle of saying something and realize that I forgot to mention xyz, and then I'll immediately backtrack and it gets confusing. Or, I'll get distracted by student responses and respond to them in the middle of what I was saying and forget my train of thought. I don't want to be talking for an entire class period or anything, but if I even try to fix a misconception I just stumble over myself trying to explain it in a way, then re-explain it in a slightly different way, etc and it feels like the students just get more confused. Being unable to explain things well makes me super anxious and then it's hard to focus. **Did anyone else start out this way? If so, how did you get over it (or did you decided to do something else as a career)?**   

And then there's the question of subject. I'm a fan of science and I have a whole degree in it but I wanted to be an english teacher if only because I love talking about characters and writing and story analysis, but my advisors encouraged me to stay in STEM. What I want out of teaching is to encourage kids on a daily basis to develop good socioemotional habits (like being nice to themselves, etc.) and find things they care about earlier rather than later. After student teaching science, it really doesn't seem like there's much room for even all the science material that should be included, much less non-content material. So now, I'm stuck between ""Science is really hard and a LOT of work @ making labs and I feel like I'm overall more passionate about English"" and ""I did all this training for Science that I won't get for English, I don't even read a lot, and I'll have to study/pay for English certification. It might also just suck?"". 

**Does anyone have any advice for emotional material in STEM?** **Has anyone swapped from STEM to lib arts? If so, what was your experience like + how would you compare the two, content preparation and overall difficulty-wise?**"
thats-not-my-name-93,2021-04-20 15:56:06+00:00,Maternity Leave Sub Rant," 

I am 35 weeks pregnant with our first child. I have been teaching math at the same high school for 6 years and loving it. Right when I was pregnant, I told the school and the district office that they need to find a sub for me. I will be missing 3 weeks and final exams. I told them I would follow contract and create 2 weeks of planning and then the long term sub can do the rest... well that is not the case... I was informed today that I need to plan everything for the rest of the year because the sub doesn't know how to do math... I teach Algebra 1 and 2 and am very frustrated that they couldn't get someone with ANY math skills.

My building principal told me today that I need to create notes, worksheets, quizzes, and the finals before I have my baby... WHICH COULD BE ANYDAY NOW! AND he told me I need to record a video of me teaching all of the notes so the students don't fall behind and so the sub doesn't have to.

My sub reached out to me and reminded me how he doesn't understand math and that ""technology is hard for this old fella"" BUT HE HAS TO GRADE THE FINAL, SUBMIT FINAL GRADES, AND SUBMIT FINAL EXAM GRADES ON OUR ONLINE GRADEBOOK. I just see this going horribly.

I have talked to my union rep and she said that COVID made it impossible to find subs so there isn't much I can do. She said I could just follow contract and do 2 weeks of planning, and that I wouldn't get in trouble... I am already stressed enough with having this baby and now I have to do SO much more work for my maternity sub plans. Trying to not let it get to me but MAN I am frustrated!"

beyonddead,2021-04-20 03:28:50+00:00,Teaching is like Art," \[Part of my assignment\]

Teaching is almost like art, every artist starts with the same paint on their palettes, but every artist makes something unique to themselves to essentially communicate something. Imagine you’re a painter, and a museum asks you to bring in a painting to display in their gallery.

Art involves the artist, the art piece and the observer. In fact, the observer is an integral part of 

art. If their subjective experience resonates with the piece of art, the artist may have succeeded.

So what will you choose?

Your painting must be worth looking at. It must be compelling. It must also evoke something in the observer to invest their time and attention in your piece. Well, there is already an audience at the gallery, whether they want to be there or not, they’re already there. What can you do to make your art stand out?

One option might be bringing in your wine-night painting that was essentially the same painting as the other 30 people in the room who bought the same Groupon deal as you. Sure, the painting *looks* nice, it may even have one or two unique variations to the other 30 people around you— but more or less— it’s the same. Maybe it’s a night sky, with a bright moon and a blossoming cherry tree. As beautiful as it is, it’s a copy in one way or another. And people will just say that it’s nice, and you may have been proud of that piece, but the observer’s investment is little to none.

Your other option is to provide an art piece that is unique and meaningful to you. Something you’d want to share with others, maybe there’s an important message to be said, maybe there’s something worth *looking at*. You could veer away from the ensemble of art that screams genericism and work on a piece that offers something to your audience. The more time, effort and patience spent on your piece, the more compelling your piece becomes. It is layered, and offers observers to connect to your piece on different levels.

In a retrospect, we can all conjure incredibly unique artwork in our minds, but to translate these images in our minds requires a level of transposition that separates good artists from great artists. Like artists, teachers may hold a wealth of knowledge, but the skill of teaching requires the ability to articulate our knowledge into comprehensible steps in our lesson plans."
sanma0,2021-04-20 00:52:06+00:00,calstateteach: worth it for out-of-state applicants/better than ABCTE?,"hello,

hope everyone is doing well! I'm new around here but am looking into gaining a teacher's certification. 

currently, i'm looking into the ABCTE program + an online MEd pathway with the secondary certification and student teaching component—this is the only option that exists in my home state, which is one of the few that recognizes the American Board alternative certification. i'm interested in the ABCTE for its 1) cost (the UC programs are a bit too pricey for me) 2) efficiency, but I have also been researching the calstateteach program as a former CA resident. so, my questions to anyone who has participated in calstateteach or the (online) cal state credential system or has thoughts on ABCTE:

1) is the program significantly more expensive for those paying out-of-state tuition than the 11k number or so for in-state residents? for me, the total cost (including ABCTE fees) would be about that for the alternative route certification, so if the difference in credit cost only amounts to a few thousand, I'm wondering if the ABCTE pathway is as cost effective as it initially seemed.

2) would it be the case that a CA state license is more flexible than an ABCTE + MEd if I wanted to perhaps convert that teaching license to teach n a state that does not recognize the ABCTE (e.g. MA)?

thank you so much for any guidance you might be able to provide!"

Not only for homework, this would be such a great help for exercises during class as well, where I want to see and give points to what the students have written, without having to download files in the middle of class and without having them see each other's answers.

gauchelygraceful,2021-04-17 03:27:26+00:00,Going into Teach for America this summer and having mixed feelings about it,"Hey all, I'm a recent college grad who is joining Teach for America's South Dakota corps this summer. Part of me is excited because I love kids, I love teaching them about the world, and I love seeing them get enthusiastic about learning something new. I feel strongly that education is one of the most powerful resources for kids, so when I was accepted to TFA, it felt like a dream come true. 

That being said, I'm feeling apprehensive about this coming year for quite a few reasons. The first is that, despite the good it stands for, TFA has a lot of issues, two of them being that a) they don't give their teachers enough training, and b) the turnover rate it encourages tends to be more harmful than beneficial to students and often displaces veteran teachers in the area.  I'm now anxious about what my experience with TFA will be like and about whether or not I will do more harm than good through my involvement with the organization. I'm also starting to worry that I'll find out that I'm not cut out to be a teacher and that I'll have no idea what to do with my life anymore. The past two or so years have been highly education career-focused (I'm currently working on my certification and getting an M.A. in English, and have worked a few part-time jobs in education), so I would be devastated if I found out that teaching wasn't for me.

Any advice?"

At the start of this school year, I was contacted by a parent at my local youth club in regards to tutoring for her son. I began tutoring her son every day of the week except for Saturdays. At first I enjoyed my work, but then the mother began expecting me to do more than just tutor (such as organize the house) and I was afraid to say no so I agreed. I later worked up the courage to ask for a raise because I believe I am underpaid as it is anyways and I was taking on more responsibilities than I was hired for. She quickly knocked me down and said that she refused to give me a raise. I want to quit working, but feel that it would be ethically wrong for me to leave the son so shortly before his end of the year exams (a little over 6 weeks left). Every night I come home and dread having to tutor. What should I do? I am afraid to make the family mad by quitting. 

Thanks in advance"

tamaleringwald,2021-04-16 01:15:56+00:00,"I've been non-renewed at 2 schools in 2 years. Neither were my fault, but does it still look bad on an application?","I got my credential (after 10 yrs of subbing, after-school programs, and arts ed) in 2019. I recieved an MSC with Theatre Arts Authorization, and a school hired me to teach drama full-time plus help them implement a new arts magnet program for the 2019-2020 school year.

Well, you know what happened next. So the entire arts program got scrapped in June 2020, and my contract was not renewed-- thoughI got several glowing references and letters of recommendation from colleagues there.

Luckily, right away I got another drama position. When I was hired everyone thought in-person school was starting in the fall-- we didn't know until after I signed my contract that we'd be staying in distance learning indefinitely (we're FINALLY coming back in 2 weeks). Teaching drama to 500 kids over Zoom every week has been a mess, but I've done the best I could.

Except now, again because of COVID, I'm losing my job at the end of the year. Fall enrollment dropped significantly-- which meant less classroom teachers, which meant less prep periods, which meant they didn't need as many specials teachers to cover the prep periods... and the thing about drama is that even among specials, we're on the bottom rung. A school will always eliminate drama before they'll eliminate music or art.

The last few weeks I've been applying like crazy (I live in the SF Bay Area), to both regular classroom teaching (which I'm fully qualified to do) and theatre teaching positions, in grades K-8. If you count all the individual public schools, private schools, charter schools, and district pools I've applied to so far, it's easily over 100 jobs. Yet I've only gotten 2 interview offers, and both are for schools that are hard-to-staff and pay terribly.

Is there room for understanding when HR sees 2 non-renewals in 2 years on a applicant's resume, or does it automatically go into the trash bin? Do the extenuating COVID-related factors in both cases make a difference, or the fact that both schools have nothing but good things to say about me?

I'm worried that I have a strike against me for things I had absolutely no control over. Am I panicking over nothing?"

Mind you, we were already down one sped teacher this year because they couldn’t fill the position. So now I’m responsible for 19 self contained students with moderate/severe disabilities ranging in age from K-5th grade in a hybrid model without an aid (because I haven’t had one all year) and the one from the classroom I’m absorbing, well they’re going on medical leave. Kids will be transitioning to me Monday morning. I’m going to be writing at least 10 separate lesson plans based on student ability - not to mention how I’m supposed to have time for copies and actually teaching the material PLUS all of the paperwork that comes along with special Ed.  

This isn’t a pity post - I just really needed to tell someone who understood (hence this sub) because I’m at my wits end. I’m a hell of a teacher and I know it - but I just can’t keep making these outrageous situations work."

Not seeing it as a big deal, I tried to console her, letting her know it would be alright. But that wasn't even the end of it, she told me the principal called out every student over the microphone in the cafeteria during lunch individually and handed them a summer school letter. My daughter faced ridicule and was made fun of for the rest of the day. 😡😠😡😠So much for OCPS creating a warm and welcoming environment. The principal deserves to be suspended the same way she likes to suspend students for offenses less sever than this. 1st, she got caught not wearing a mask while fixing lunch for students in September, then 12 of her teachers have left since the school year started, and now this? No wonder so many students and teachers are unhappy at that place and why so many fellow parents say there's a toxic learning environment at Freedom Middle School.I can't wait to take her out next year.

I have my first time delivering a lesson today and I don’t have faith that my lesson planning will be enough.

I’ve coached younger students before when I was in my final years of school, but that was without the pressure of not getting a job if I made a couple of mistakes along with the fact that I was still a student so I had a bit more leeway with how I could act with the students (able to use slang to be relatable, knew some of them personally so could make jokes towards them but the situation is a bit different as I’m not a student) 

To put it simply, because this is a one off lesson and I won’t have 6 weeks to develop these student’s abilities, could I get away with having a vague overall objective but make the activities as fun as possible so the recruiter sees that the students are having fun around me? Or will I need to be strictly educational.

Any tips for first lesson nerves will help!"

neonpoison,2021-04-07 02:59:52+00:00,Denied by Cal Poly Pomona - It felt like a bad April Fool's joke but it wasn't. Was this a simple mistake and/or an intentional betrayal?,"TL/DR: I felt betrayed by Cal Poly because all three of their people I've talked to - The Admissions Advisor, the Credential Analyst, and the Academic Advisor - all failed to provide accurate information to me during the application process. They made me belief that there was a very low chance for denial (based on my background and experience). ""The rejection cases we see usually involve applicants totally screwing up their essays or something."" - This was the kind of answers I got after specifically asking each of them about my application. 

I know that admissions aren't guaranteed. (doh) But did they intentionally create the illusion of a near-guarantee and mislead me in my case? Did they fail to communicate internally about how many more applicants they received and caused this mess? (If this is true, there should be more people sharing similar stories as mine). No matter what the real reason is behind their lies and misinformation, I am sharing this here so people hopefully avoid suffering the same frustration. Here's the long version:

I have been teaching in international and private high schools for over 11 years. Having personally helped thousands of students with their Common Apps, I was well aware of our college admissions system. (Or so I thought). I thought Credential programs like this are different in a good way. My reasoning was this: since California has a shortage of teachers, they should have made it easier to get into Credential programs. Again, this assumption was confirmed multiple times and throughout all the conversations I've had with the three individuals mentioned above. 

During the mandatory Zoom interview with the Academic Advisor, he even said something along the lines of: ""The rejection cases we see usually involves applicants totally screwing up their essays or something. So you should be fine.""

I was certainly convinced that I was getting in, I followed all the procedures, I did everything they asked, I communicated timely and frequently. I can't emphasize this enough: I asked for feedback for my application chances throughout the process and was repeatedly advised to not worry."

tarathetarantula,2021-04-06 15:32:05+00:00,Should I apply for this job?,"I moved to a rural area with the lowest paying school district in the state. They are constantly in financial distress. I am certified as a school librarian. They have a very difficult time finding and retaining teachers because their pay is so low, and housing here is incredibly difficult to attain. Many vacation rentals, no longterm residential rentals, hard to purchase a house because out of staters swoop them up with cash in hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, I applied for two jobs, both which I was offered. The first one ended up being less hours than they first told me, so I could not accept the position. It wasn't enough pay. Second one was basically a social worker. Because they couldn't find a social worker for the position, they hired me as an emergency hire, at a very low step. They told me I could keep the job if I also jumped through a bunch of hoops in two years - basically getting a second masters degree that I could not get time-wise (too many courses to fulfill). I decided to take the job, even though I realized it would only be one year at a low pay and also well below my experience/step. It was meaningful work, even if just for a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I showed up to my first day of training (I only had two before school started) and they did not train me on a thing. Instead, they refused that I ask questions but also told me I would be the art teacher and health teacher, in addition to the primary mandatory reporter of child abuse and homelessness at three schools. I would also be responsible for implementing a behavior policy that was not in writing, and nobody would tell me what it was. When I asked, the head teacher responded ""like anyone knows"". It isn't a bad school - they are just so underfunded. Only 1/3 of the students at their elementary school graduate the school. Their parents move bc pay is so low here, and they can't make it out here. One last thing -  a teacher was trying to come to this particular elementary school to be our art teacher, from a different school in the district. She was awarded the transfer, but then her other school would be short an art teacher - so they threatened to make her pay back all of her health insurance premiums if she switched schools, in the same district. That was terrifying to me. No teacher can do that, especially in this area. Long story short, I quit after that one day, before my OWN health insurance started and I would be held legally liable to repay it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't have a housing problem bc my boyfriend has stable work here. I have ten years of experience as a librarian. A librarian job opened up in this district. Even though I quit that social worker job, I know they will hire me. The school is five minutes down the road. But I hate the way this district is run. Question is - should I apply, or too many red flags? Thanks for any opinions."

2sticky2b4gotten,2021-04-04 02:31:54+00:00,Would you recommend dual certification (in SPED or ESL) for someone who isn't 100% passionate about either?,"I'm going to grad school for Elementary Ed, and the school I'm going to has a dual degree program where I could add on a Moderate Disabilities license, but it's a lot more expensive. It would be 8 more credits (so $8,000 more), and it would be an unpaid practicum rather than the paid full year elementary internship. 

First of all, my main interest in teaching is in reading and maybe writing. I would like to teach either 1st or 2nd ideally, and when I think about teaching I mainly just think of teaching reading lol (obviously the other subjects too, but I feel like if I do have a ""passion"" for anything it would be literacy). 

I imagine I COULD do that in some capacity with a Moderate Disabilities credential in a resource room. But I have honestly never thought about teaching special ed before I applied to this school, and I don't know if I could deal with the infamous paperwork and IEP meetings and apparently the constant threat of possibly being sued (!?), without the ""passion"" for special ed itself. 

Basically, I think it might be interesting, but to be honest I'm thinking about it more because I'll be in Massachusetts which is allegedly one of the hardest states to find a job, and everyone is saying you NEED a dual cert to get hired anywhere and it's kind of freaking me out.

Somewhat the same story for possibly trying to get certified in ESL. I think it could be interesting since I am interested in languages and learning languages etc. but again, it's not my PASSION. So I don't know if it would be worth the extra expense of the coursework and testing.

Has anyone else thought about this? It might be nice to have another option besides gen ed classroom teaching, but yeah the costs are kind of astronomical. Anyone in Massachusetts who has thoughts about the expense vs hiring rate dilemma of adding extra certs would be appreciated as well :)"

darkanon_,2021-04-01 12:32:18+00:00,"I want to research combining gamification, expression and immersive storytelling in a school curriculum.","*This is an excerpt from a letter to my college professor in the technology education major.*

I know I am supposed to be working on a video production curriculum plan for my senior design project, but I think I have stumbled onto something much more compelling. If possible, I want to research gamification of curriculum in the classroom. When I first attending the ITEEA conference in Atlanta, Georgia, I attended a session (I am not sure what they’re actually called) about gamifying your classroom. The teacher (who I believe was actually from somewhere in Connecticut) used a program called Rezzly in her classroom. Essentially, the different assignments which students could complete in her classroom awarded them with experience points. As they earned experience points, they could level up. The students in her classroom could also tackle these classroom missions for experience points in any order they wanted. In my eyes, this made learning into a video game. Just like in World of Warcraft, I could choose to explore the content and quests in my own unique way. As an avid video gamer, I was also fascinated by the concept of leveling up a character by completing things in class. I wished that my technology education teachers did something similar while I was in high school. While I was writing up this email, I actually went over to the Rezzly website just to refamiliarize myself with how it worked. Apparently, the learning service officially shut down on August 31, 2020. To my knowledge, there is no other quest-based learning system like Rezzly available. I have been working very hard on my educational ideas over the past few months, but I think I want to invent something much better.

Ever since I went to this conference, I have been toying with this idea of turning my classroom into a video game using Rezzly. I thought that the classroom structure described in this session was very similar to something I would create myself. The only problem with Rezzly in my eyes though is the lack of a story. When I try to use Rezzly in my classroom, do I just give them the missions at the beginning of the semester? As a master procrastinator myself, I assume many kids will look at these assignments for experience points one thing. They will most definitely goof off on their smartphones and play games on the computer at the beginning of the semester and struggle to get the work done before the end of the semester due to their procrastination. I have seen that many kids struggle to stay on task throughout my many observation hours. I noticed when computers are present (as they typically are in a technology education classrooms) the likelihood that the student gets off task is exponentially higher. Shiny screens and access to the Internet just have this kind of effect on students these days. I started thinking about Rezzly, and I want to make something similar but different in that it keeps kids invested in learning.

The first area of technology education I would like to test this on is woodshop. I remember writing a very comprehensive curriculum plan for Materials Processing, but let’s just throw typical curriculums out the window for a second because what I am trying to do is honestly much different. In my comic book universe, I have a superhero named Ink Girl (based on my best friend, Stephanie) who also happens to be a woodshop prodigy. One of her many superpowers allows her to build things super quickly. If I was going to use this character in my classroom, I would begin my showing the students a five-minute short introductory video which tells the story of Ink Girl. I am just going to make this up as I go, but let’s try to make a proof of concept. Our main character, Aurora Willoughby is using her magical tattoo superpowers to chase down an evil magical sorcerer named Dreslaran. Dreslaran is an amazing villain character from a secret society where magic is taught to kids beginning in kindergarten. When he was just fourteen, he chose to use evil magic and break away from the secret society he grew up in because they wanted to keep magic a secret. Just like a much bigger villain named Daniel Darkblade, Dreslaran is looking for the key to immortality in Artemis’ mystical golden armor told about in legends passed by travelers over time. Ink Girl attempts to stop this villain with her powers in an epic battle sequence which gets the kids excited in the same way as Marvel movies. The kids hold onto their seats Ink Girl takes cover for a moment. She breaks the fourth wall and she speaks to the audience instructing them to build her a catapult to use in her fight against Dreslaran. She continues to say the more of the story will be unveiled after the students launch their projectiles at Dreslaran together. After two weeks of working in groups and building wooden catapults in the workshop, the students use their contraptions. The class ends with the next video in this story. The catapult hits Dreslaran directly as he disappears into a black portal. Ink Girl tries to figure out what has happened to Dreslaran. As she feared he had escaped her grasp once again. Ink Girl walks back to her apartment. The room is covered with posters from punk rock bands like Panic! At The Disco, Green Day and Fall Out Boy. She sits down at her computer and looks for unusual criminal activity to stop with her powers. She listens to the police radio hoping to find an opportunity to save someone. She finds a strange article about a large ball of blue light seen in the park last Friday night. She prints out the information while looking at more videos taken of the unexplainable blue glow in the park. She investigates further and finds other strange sightings throughout the town documented online. She prints them all out and then looks to the audience and speaks again. She explains that she needs a snazzy wooden desk organizer to sort all the information she is finding on these strange occurrences. The next two weeks of the class would involve building desk organizers for Ink Girl before revealing a video containing more of the mystery. I want to make learning fun by getting students invested into this elaborate and exciting storyline. I don’t think that every teacher would want to use this, but I certainly think could be a different approach to teaching to try if you class doesn’t care about anything you assign. This might be a way to get younger kids excited about woodshop class. They would be building things for Ink Girl to use throughout her adventure. As students complete different parts of the building process, they can gain experience points. As they gain more experience points, they can buy things to customize their superhero avatars. You can view the superhero avatars in your class while you are logged into this online learning platform. I would like the students to be able to buy things to customize their characters that are based on pop culture. If a student really likes watching Riverdale, they can put on Jughead Jones’ Southside Serpents leather jacket. If they are really into movies, they might wear Dorothy’s shoes from The Wizard of Oz. I want to make the character customization a reward for kids and a way to express themselves. Many kids don’t have the money to buy nice looking clothing. The cool thing about digitally customizing these characters is that nothing will cost money. You can choose to express yourself in anyway you want, simply by playing your part in the story and working through the creations that Ink Girl needs.

I am not sure if I explained that well, but that is the idea I have floating around in my head. I want to make learning opportunities where students are immersed into a story. Most students see technology education as an elective and usually don’t take it as seriously as classes like math and English. I want to make these superhero stories so epic that kids can’t help but get excited to learn in class.

One of the questions I asked myself when writing this email is what about the other days? Sure, kids will probably be invested into the story during the short film and that day but they probably will forget about it over the course of the two weeks which they are working on the current project. I want to come up with little bits of future story that can be revealed on each day of class. An example of this might be telling the kids that Ink Girl will uncover a conspiracy in her town involving large blue balls of light and other unexplainable things. Another example could be Dreslaran teleporting back to Ink Girl’s location and erasing one of Ink Girl’s magical tattoos with a mystical artifact. The bits of story on each day will be a reward for the students working hard in class. Before the story piece for the day is revealed, each student will have to fill out an exit slip explaining one thing that they learned during that class.

I want to explore this stuff as the next stage to gamification in not just technology education, but education in general. Educational superhero stories like this can be used with any topic. I could do a similar thing with video editing and my superhero counterpart, Professor Duality. The possibilities are endless and I have some really out-of-the-box ideas to go along with these thoughts.

I want to make learning fun again, but I also want to create really cool characters who can inspire kids. Maybe one kid likes Ink Girl so much that he gets really into woodshop and even buys their own Sawstop for their work at home. Maybe one kid likes Professor Duality so much that they download Adobe After Effects CS6 to make cool visual effects like he does on his computer in the stories."
EnvironmentalGal77,2021-04-01 02:25:32+00:00,Is it possible to be a substitute teacher while working a FT job??,"I work FT as a park ranger (Friday’s off), but I’ve had many other jobs in my past centered around education. It’s something I really enjoy and feel passionate about. Lately, I’ve been feeling interested in becoming a teacher. I’m nervous about quitting my job and jumping headfirst in teaching without a lot of experience working in a classroom before. 

I’m considering trying out the field through substitute teaching while working my current full time job. I have Fridays off, so I thought I could potentially just have my availability open on Friday’s. Would this be feasible? If not, what are other ways I can test out working in a classroom without giving up my full time position??"

They seem annoyed, and at times angry with the children (kindergarteners) over stupid simple things, that often times they couldn't help or weren't their fault. I never acted this way at my previous job, and neither were my coworkers. They like to yell at the children, and well, treat them like children. I hate how they talk to and about the kids. Its annoying. Am I slightly worried im going to be stressed enough by my job that I end up becoming this way too?.. All of the kids kept reiterating that I was ""the nicest teacher ever"" but I did JUST arrive, so of course they like me haha. I know theres a rumor that elementary school teachers and nurses are ""mean girls"" grown up (and funnily enough im replacing a staff member whose going off to study nursing) but it just seems like a stupid way to raise/teach kids..

gg1384743,2021-03-31 19:33:29+00:00,Temporary Teaching cert for just one year? Florida,"To make a long story short: Im going to graduate undergrad with a degree in biology in December and then I plan on going to PA school (PA is sort of like a doctor). But in between I will have a little over a year where nothing I do counts towards my application for PA school. I've always been interested in teaching and I discovered the temporary teaching certificate route in Florida that allows you to teach without teaching degree and I thought it would be a unique opportunity to explore something outside my field that interests me (also if I taught bio it might help keep me sharp for grad school). But I have some questions I am hoping you might be able to answer:

1. What exactly do I need to apply for the temporary cert I saw one thing that says I need to take a tests but other things that say I can just meet the degree requirements? What about to get the biology specialization? 
2. From what I understand, the temporary cert is designed so you can be part time completing normal teacher degree and is 3 years. Obviously, I don't really want the normal teaching degree but to get the temporary cert do I have to be enrolled in a program for getting a normal teaching degree? Also does it matter I only want to teach for one year, like will I get in trouble for quitting after 1 year?
3. From my understanding, you must get a teaching job to be granted the temporary teaching cert. How do I go about applying for jobs if I have no teaching cert ? Do I just say I expect to get one upon employment ? Does just having a temporary certificate disqualify me from getting normal teacher salary?
4. Is there any benefit to getting a biology specialization or not? (Easier to get cert, easier to get job, salary, etc...)
5. Is there any benefit to applying to teach certain grades? (Easier to get cert, easier to get job, salary, etc...)
6. Any general advice, guidance, resources ?

Any information you have would be so appreciated :)"

I've seen a lot of listings where the only qualifications I really need are a degree and a state teaching license since, supposedly, high school physics teachers are in high demand right now. The thing is, I don't want to remain in the state I currently live in, nor do I have much of a preference for what state I would like to live in. But all of these job listings are in different states and each state has a different certification. My problem is that I can't just pick a state and go get the certification in that state because what if I do and there are no jobs there once I'm certified. 

**So I was hoping someone on here might know if there are any ways to look for places that are willing to hire me *before* I'm certified to teach**, so that I can then go out and get the certification in that state without worrying about whether or not I'll be able to find a job in that state.

adult_in_training_,2021-03-31 15:59:33+00:00,Didn't realize how exhausted I was until spring break...,"I am a first year teacher teaching 7th grade science. I am miserable. I am exhausted, I am burnt out.

We were hybrid most of the year and went back to full time last week. This week is spring break. On Friday I went to bed at 10pm... woke up at 7:30 pm on Saturday. I was still exhausted even after that. Everyday I have been sleeping 10 hours with naps in between. I never realized how exhausted I was. This felt different from a depression phase (I have bipolar amd GAD so depressive phases are normal for me). I WANTED to enjoy spring break playing games,reading,watching anime. But I physically could not stay up due to exhaustion.

I teach 7th grade science. Kids don't do their work during hybrid and during in person they complain constantly. I hate my content. I was originally a Bio major, I added a teaching major my junior year because I realized how much I loved teaching when I volunteered at a high school. I LOVE teaching highschool. I woke up excited every day. I love biology soooooo much. But because of COVID, I ended up taking the first job I could get when I heard they were postponing interviews indefinitely. And that job was as a 7th grade science teacher.

This age group is not for me (though I do cherish my kids!) and I honestly couldn't care less about heat transfer and moon phases (although they are important! Just not for me!) I miss photosynthesis and meiosis/mitosis. I miss everything about it. I'm looking for a HS bio job but they are scarce rn.

Long story short,I am exhausted,lack motivation, hate what I teach and can't handle this age group. My professors said I was born to be a teacher,my cooperating teachers wrote racing reviews, I loved everything about teaching, but I'm burning out..."

WeeJabbyCunt,2021-03-31 15:39:45+00:00,School wants me to create reading program??,"So up until this year, my school has implemented a structured, reading support class with pre-provided curriculum. It wasn’t the best, but it definitely wasn’t the worst, and the curriculum was created by literacy specialists. I could implement it and supplement with my own stuff, etc. 

Now they want to stop doing it, but they still want to have reading support classes. I am in no way trained or qualified to offer literacy support, and the thought of creating a curriculum to support students who are several grade levels behind in addition to the other classes I teach sounds impossible. It’s an academic intervention, shouldn’t someone trained in literacy development be doing this? 

Am I within my rights to turn this down, or should I just go for it? Is it ridiculous to demand that the job be done by someone with the certifications to do it? I just feel like literacy development and English (one of the subjects I also teach) are VERY different things. I feel really out of my depth."

I see that of course some (online) list what they're hiring for but I figured also a good thing to at least familiarize myself with a particular school or district so they remember my name/resume even months from now in case something might work in my favor.

chuuluu,2021-03-30 18:32:31+00:00,The satisfaction of saying “no.”,"Am currently on medical leave (so no access to anything school related except the texting app I use to communicate with students). A student athlete (high school) who during the school year consistently texted me after 11pm about turning things in late so they could be eligible for grade check the following morning (and not in a polite way—they would escalate to all-caps texts if I didn’t answer them at midnight) texted me Sunday night saying, “You know how we (i.e. this kid) sometimes (always) turn in work right before the term ends? Well I don’t know the sub’s number or email so who do I contact to turn all my late assignments in tonight?” 

In my school we’re not allowed to reject late work—if it’s from that grading period we have to accept it up to our deadline and many teachers even accept work after and end up doing grade change forms. This is encouraged to the point it’s expected. We’re also not allowed to fail above a certain percentage—if you do, you’ll end up on a growth plan. This of course results in all the students thinking of deadlines as negotiable, test scores being lower because so many kids ignore work until the deadline then attempt to do a term’s worth in one night, thereby retaining nothing, and I fear for how they’ll fare in the real world. 

So it was very satisfying to reply that I told them before I went on leave that the sub doesn’t get paid to grade after hours, and that they would have to respect  whatever deadline the sub gave them. In short, “no.”"

I thought it would be fun and rewarding. Instead, I’m an abused baby sitter.

Last year, I had students that were very diverse. A students, B students, C students, D students, and students that failed. But last year made me want to quit. Maybe it’s the title 1 school situation, but man, these kids have been crazy. So many discipline problems. I can’t even teach.

Then Covid hits and in sorry to say, but it was a dream come true in a way. No more discipline problems. I was making fun videos for the students. I could set up fun projects for the kids to film. But there were students that were not doing any of the work. (Remote learning). I was told to help the kids from failing. Keep my assignments open, etc...

Now I have more A students than ever before and more F students than ever, and nobody in between.

And now, the kids are back in class, and I can’t teach anymore. And I’m done. It’s not a healthy profession to be in. It takes a physical, mental, and even spiritual toll. And I’m blamed for all the Failing students. I don’t want to be here if I can’t teach. I just want these students to shit the F up sometimes.

The ventilation systems in most of our schools are still broken, and many classrooms, including mine, don't have windows to open. We're told to just keep the kids as far apart as possible, knowing that there are classes where it will be impossible to keep kids 6 feet apart. With only 8 weeks in the semester, it seems like we're going to barely get any of the logistics on this to work before the semester will be over, and what little time I had left to actually try to teach anything will be gone.

I got in an argument with a friend about all of this because he thinks it's great they're finally opening schools and thinks that research and studies point to the fact that they should have been open for a long time. The truth of the matter is that I don't think he cares that much about the education part, but really misses his daily baby sitter. One of the reasons I pointed out to him that I didn't think returning was a good idea was all of the stories I read here on reddit. I hear stories of staff, and even students that have died from this disease. Cases spiking in schools and it getting somewhat brushed under the rug. While I know that the are many studies that show that younger children don't spread the virus as readily as adults, the number is still not zero.

Anyway, he had to point out, maybe rightly, that taking people's personal experiences off of here is anecdotal and creates a bias. But I've not a heard a single teacher say that in-person learning has been anything less than a huge dumpster fire, anywhere, ever. I have been surprised to hear that this seems to even be the case in countries outside of the U.S. So I thought I would throw out there the question: Has in-person been successful for anybody? Have you found this working well, cases haven't spread, students are doing better in the classroom, ect, and you just haven't posted the success story?"
gingersnapped99,2021-03-29 08:57:52+00:00,Recommendations for online reading games at the early elementary level?,"Hi, everyone! I’m currently enrolled in college, but I volunteer a couple times a week by tutoring students remotely on Zoom.

I have a five-year-old student whose mother recently asked me if I know of any reading games since her son is beginning to get bored of https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com (a good resource, btw!) and isn’t focusing when he plays it. I don’t have much communication with other tutors, and the program I work through doesn’t provide suggested resources and usually focuses on developing math skills.

Does anyone here know of any games I could tell her about? Most of the ones I’ve managed to find are either a) just playing videos for the kids or b) brief one-time activities rather than a continuous game with a profile.

Thank you!!!"

Our government takes pride in saying (and reminding it everyday) that we're one of the only European countries that hasn't closed its schools at all since September. Cases are growing like never before. Every country around us, Germany, the UK, Italy has closed their schools for the last couple months. But in France, nooooo, never, what a silly idea. We're reminded everyday that the virus is not transmitted at school! We've had countless different protocols. To this day, and it's been a few months, we have to open the windows in the classroom for the first 15 minutes of class, and this regardless of the temperature. When a kid is tested positive, we're not considerate as a 'contact case' because we wear masks (needless to say one third of the students wear their mask under their nose) and we're not even told sometimes because of the 'medical secret'. And last night, our great minister of education shared a song on YouTube, sang by American parents that are sick on online learning. This is disrespectful as heck. I'm tired of it all.

All year I have wanted to quit, but I didn't give up as it was the right thing for the students. However, I feel like I haven't been the best teacher I could be nor the best wife, mother and homemaker.   However, here we are nearing the end and I'm a finalist for Teacher of the Year and could very well win.  I'm flattered, but feel I'm not really the most deserving.  While I did a sufficient job, I feel like those who know me well know how hard this year was for me.   Technically, if I win and accept teacher of the year, I'm supposed to be coming back next year, but I haven't made up my mind yet.  Part of me will have a tough time leaving the profession to be a SAHM again but part of me knows that I want my family life back and that a different position or subbing can be rewarding and more balanced.   My question is, do I approach admin and let them know I'm not certain at all I'm coming back and that if I win, please, give it to someone else or do I just see what happens, accept the title if I win and then make a decision by the end of the school year.   I feel that if I accept it and the don't come back, I took away the joy and glory another deserving teacher could have but I also don't want to be guilted into staying.  Or maybe I should stay.

So I start student teaching next semester and I am extremely frustrated with my school and with colleges all across the country. I had a meeting with the person that matches us with our host teachers and schools. I am beyond frustrated!! I think in this day in age, especially with the pandemic financially stressing everyone, it is absolutely insane to think that student teachers should pay full tuition, let alone tell them that they cannot have a job. It is absurd to think that these students should basically be doing a paid internship, students paying for the internship, though. The audacity they have to tell students that they should not be working, not everyone is financially stable or should feel obligated to take out more loans for student teaching. A regular internship in the business or political science department at my school would literally be paid, and it is a part of the program that they have a semester of paid interning. It is just frustrating how other students benefit from these paid internships while education students are thrown into the trash basically. Does anyone else have a similar experience? I have friends that go through different educational programs and they all are not allowed to have a job and are not paid through this ""teaching internship"" (it is sometimes called this in different states). I was just wondering if this was all over the US or just in my state because frankly, this is ridiculous."

I wonder as a teacher in Finance &amp; Control and Economics if it would be possible at all to land on a job like finance administration. I mean I got a ton of knowledge during my study about finance &amp; Control however someone who would have a degree in Finance &amp; Control obviously has more knowledge and for sure more practial experience in a business.

My best bet would be applying for a lot of jobs and hopefully the competition isn't big and they need someone on the job ASAP. I think. 

Maybe the hardest part will be to get the first job in finance. What if I land on a job and let's say work 3 years in it. Would it be easy from there to grow up in other financial jobs? Or will this education degree forever hunt me when pursuing a career in finance when trying to find a new job?

therealcourtjester,2021-03-14 14:59:51+00:00,Ethics while teaching during a pandemic,"I recently read this white paper and found it articulated things I was experiencing but couldn’t put a name to.  For example the author says that based on the stated priorities of schools, “we value schools as providers of care before and even above their roles as deliverers of learning opportunities.”   I have felt this, even before the Covid shutdown in situations such as our state requiring all students to have lunch at school, even on shortened days.  This meant our class period became 30 minute periods (and lunch waves started at 9:30 am) in order to get every thing in plus a lunch wave on short days.

What I really found valuable about reading this was the identification of the policy that all students are educated during a pandemic or no students are educated.  The author defines the idea of leveling down and concludes “Even if there were somewhat equitable leveling down within the district (although middle-class families within the district would likely still find ways to educate their children), between-district inequities would be further and likely irremediably exacerbated.”  This has been my observation and instinct as well.

I am interested in other perspectives here of professionals out in the trenches.  Have there been shifts in your district to level down?  Is it working?

*In very small classes, we read very good books and pressed the students to think deeply about the words on the page. A lesson plan was not a list of points for the teacher to make; it was a set of questions. Even better: a single question. I always joked that the perfect lesson plan would have been to wait until the students had assembled in the classroom, throw in a copy of The Iliad, and go to lunch. By senior year, it might have actually worked. By then, they knew what we were teaching them to do. “The seventh grader says Macbeth is weird,” my department chair told me once. “The 12th grader says Macbeth is ambitious.” Once students could make discernments like that, it was time for college.*

Granted the example is from a teacher that taught in this environment 25 years ago, but it made me wonder...do private schools put emphasis on stuff like ""I Can"" statements, learning intentions, posted standards, etc.? Or is that pure public school minutia?"

I want this spot so badly, but I’m so nervous. I’m not very impressive on paper, being that I’ve been away from teaching longer than I was actively employed. I think I’m possibly the only interview for this position, but I don’t want to bank on that and I really want to wow them.

In the interview, I have 10 minutes to introduce and present a lesson, and then explain the follow up activities from that lesson. My chosen standard is “use the Pythagorean theorem and its converse to solve problems”. It’s Texas standard 8.7(C) for anyone familiar with the TEKS. Anyway, I’m really struggling trying to narrow down how to approach this. There are so many unknowns and I could really use some help. I know this school is really big on preassessment, differentiated/personalized instruction, and all those other buzz words. 

Here are my ideas so far:
-Preassess by going over the PT equation, squares/square roots, and watch a short animated video depicting PT. 
-Lesson- discuss how we might use the Pythagorean theorem to find an unknown length, or how to determine if a triangle is a right triangle based on lengths of sides? Doodle notes on the document camera where I model practice problems (I would also offer pre-typed notes for students who prefer/need them). We would do a handful of problems together, possibly where they write answers on a white board and hold them up to show me so I can kind of assess as we go. 
-Practice-  individual or partner practice on worksheets, or complete a foldable as a group, or complete like a jeopardy game in teams, or do like an escape room activity in groups (I prefer homogenous groups for the activities, heterogenous groups for foldables/group notes)
-Assessment- exit ticket on their way out so I can see who’s getting it
-Take it further- project where they come up with real-world application, build or draw a model, write a word problem, and solve. 

I understand that Covid protocols would change these in practice, but it didn’t say to take Covid into account. 

Thoughts? Changes? I desperately want to get this position. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Domak04,2021-03-11 18:53:24+00:00,Should I be concerned about one of my students?,"I’m not sure if I should be concerned about one of my students. 

So today I asked one of my students a question. 

He didn’t know the answer and I noticed he started getting a little agitated. I tried giving him a couple of hints but he just didn’t know. He started getting really distressed. He put his head down and started shaking his hands a little repeating the phrase “I’m sorry I don’t know” again and again. I asked someone else pretty much immediately after that.

I’m not sure if this is cause for concern.

For background info:
He is 16, he’s male. He is quite intelligent, doing fine in my class. 
1. I have taught him since September and this is the first time anything like this had happened. 
2. He seems to hate being the centre of attention for good reasons or bad reasons. 
3. He appears nervous and shy when it comes to talking either to me, or in-front of the class. 
4. He’s very very quiet in class, never chats with anyone else. He walks in, does his work, walks out. 
5. When I ask him a question in class, he always sounds very very nervous, he seems to be low on self confidence because he always seems surprised when he gets a question right. 
6. He also never volunteers an answer to a question, even if I ask him and it turns out he knows, he doesn’t ever put his hand up. 
7. He seems to be a very literal person. I once asked him to go up and write something on the board. He did, but his writing was fairly small. I jokingly said to him “do you think you could write EVEN smaller?” sarcastically. But he then wrote the next thing even smaller. When I told him I was being sarcastic, he turned bright red and started wringing his hands a lot, very flustered. 
8. I’m not sure if he has many friends, I never see his talking to anyone while walking in or out. 
9. I have noticed that when he does talk to someone, he doesn’t ever make eye contact with them. He looks at the floor, the table, his hands, never the face of the person he’s talking to. And he seems to be quite awkward. 
10. He seems a little childish. I’ll quite often notice him chewing on his fingernails, or softly on the collar of his jacket. And sometimes I’ll see him rocking slightly. Neither of these things are super pronounced but I do notice them. And he also sometimes sits a little oddly on his seat, for example he sometimes sits with his feet up on his chair hugging his knees. 
11. However, he’s very very sweet and kind. Before a test once, the kid sitting across the table from him was really nervous and he went over to him and said “it’ll be fine. You’ll do great. Ok?” And then after the test, he gave the kid a big double thumbs up at the end! Which was really sweet because he was super nervous too! 

Do you think I should be concerned about him? If yes, what do you think could be the problem with him? Could he have some sort of mental disorder? Or am I just worrying too much?"

-Experience as a PreK lead teacher 
-Experience as a substitute in public schools


I’m feeling a little conflicted about what I should do next...

I’m planning to move states next January so I didn’t think it’d be wise to go for a teaching position in an elementary school because I didn’t want to mislead a school and leave mid year. I’m about to graduate with certs in elementary and special education in the state I’m moving to. In between semesters/ student teaching I’ve been substituting at elementary &amp; middle schools. In the summer I have a steady job at a school age summer program. (I also have a side gig for this spring working with adult students virtually some evenings) 


My dilemma is if I should keep doing this part time at each job(~32 hpw at both jobs) or look for something full time as a full fledged teacher in PreK. I’m not too worried about the ages because my favorite experience has been with Kinders and younger students. 

It would be 40 hours per week at the same pay as my summer job &amp; higher than substituting but it would add about 10 minutes to my commute everyday(25 minutes). I don’t love the hours of the new school but my hours are also unpredictable in the summer so it could not matter much in the end.

Originally out of high school I wanted to be a teacher. But the schools where I lived were very expensive so I just continued with my dog grooming career. In 2018 I decided to go back to school for speech language pathology and fast forward to today in 2021 and I didn't get into any grad schools(had great stats but they're sooooo competitive).  The university that I went to for my undergrad degree offers a masters of teaching &amp; the initial teaching license. I have a strong desire to work with children and if I did do this I would be leaning towards special education because of the smaller classroom sizes. And I do like writing smart goals and IEP's etc. 
Obviously I'd love to continue with my speech and language path but another deterrent is the cost of graduate school as well. I'm going to have to take student loans for my graduate degree ( I have zero debt currently). The masters of teaching degree is about $15,000 which I would be able to pay for out-of-pocket. Whereas the speech language pathology degree is anywhere from 45,000 to 70,000. And as most of you know graduate degrees accrue interest daily as soon as you take them out. 

As a sidenote, I just turned 30 and I do want to have kids at some point but at this point feel like I'm spinning my wheels. If I continue with SLP I have to wait all the way until next fall to start graduate school(assuming I get in 😑). Whereas if I do the teaching program I could start this fall and be done by next fall.

FloridaEngTeacher,2021-03-10 03:48:29+00:00,You’re always replaceable,"You’re always replaceable and don’t forget it

Hi guys! Long time lurker, first time poster. I actually made an account just to post this. 

For some background info: I’m a 3rd year high school teacher in Florida. I’m currently on a Temporary certificate because I don’t have a degree in education. 

In order to upgrade to a professional certificate, the state is requiring me to go back to college and take about a years worth of education classes. Long story short, I don’t have the money. 

So I decided to pursue a lifelong goal of joining the military. 

I got a date to ship off in late December, so I told admin in January that I wouldn’t be returning after spring break. This was 9 weeks notice. My principal asked me not to inform my students because I teach a state tested class and he didn’t want them to “check out” earlier than they should. Fair enough. 

On Friday, I get called to talk to admin in my planning period. They hit me with the “your replacement starts on Monday.” I was already supposed to be out of my classroom that day for a committee meeting. I said “I can’t even tell them goodbye or explain what’s happening?” I learned that I’d be moving into another teachers vacancy until I leave. Two of the three preps are classes that I’ve never taught before and I’m also not certified for. 

So they gave me a sub Monday and then made me TRAIN MY REPLACEMENT IN MY CLASSES on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

I’m devastated. I knew I’d have to leave eventually but I didn’t know it would happen so soon. I had spent four hours just two days prior to the notice working on a unit plan to make sure I taught every standard before I left. 

For the record, on paper this is someone else’s replacement. We have a lot of vacancies currently. Why they put him in my room so early is beyond me. I feel like I’m just being punished honestly. 

When my replacement shows up on Tuesday he says, “WOW! This room is so much bigger than my old one!” Indicating that this was now going to be his room. I shot a quick email to admin who confirmed that yes, I’d be moving classrooms to the other side of the building. They did not provide me keys until 2pm the next day. I was supposed to be “saying goodbye” to my students, teaching, passing the torch, and packing up my classroom all in two days. 

I emailed my principal on Tuesday and informed him that I’d like to cancel my formal evaluation that he insisted on scheduling. He responded “I can accommodate that. I’d like to have it done by spring break!” And told me to come see him for a “winning solution.” 

I ignored him. He approached my later and I put my foot down and told him I wasn’t having a formal with students that I only knew for two weeks.

It just hurts to feel so invested just to be treated like complete shit in the 9th inning. 

Thanks for listening"

Doing a discussion topic today with a class to try and draw them back in and one of my students who's usually needs to be regularly checked on to see if he understands the tasks etc (possible SEN) did really, really well and this was with me having to work from the staff room with hoovering and chatting happening around me and he did it and his work was really good.

Tidbits1192,2021-03-09 22:25:52+00:00,My Kids Don’t Like My Class,"Kinda of a mix of a vent post and a help post. This is my second year teaching, and the second batch of kids I’ve had that dislike reading. I teach 4th grade. 

Anyways, I’ll be the first to admit that my class isn’t very fun. I wish we could do Kahoots and more fun stuff like that but the problem is that when I try to do something fun like that, my kids can’t get back into “student” mode. They just go wild and can’t settle back down. Part of that is because I’m a marshmallow when it comes to classroom management, but I’ve tried positive reinforcement with different rewards but they rarely bite on it. I don’t want to have to scream at them but for some of them, giving them detentions is the only way that makes behaviors turn around.

Their math teacher is much tougher on them to the point where I’ve heard the kids say that they’re scared of him, but they absolutely adore his class because they get to do flash card competitions. His punishments are much harsher than mine, and he contacts parents far more often than I do, and he’s made a few of them cry on occasion. But he fist bumps the kids every day when they walk into class. 

Today, they wrote a ton of stuff on my board telling him how he’s great and they love his class and everything. At first I thought it was because he was mad at them and they were trying to make up for it or whatever. Anyway, one of my girls ended up saying how I must be bitter seeing all of that stuff on the board and it kinda hurt. 

What am I doing wrong here? It’s just frustrating to me because I want to have kids actually like reading enough to try for me while also not having to become a shrew just to get some of them to behave."

I recently volunteered to teach English to a group of students from a particular Eastern European country for free. I advertised that it will be a group of 4 students.

They have to be able to at least hold a simple conversation in English. I can also speak their language on a basic level, but I want the class to be mostly, if not fully, in English. My question for you fellow teachers is what sort of activities should I plan for these students to partake in? I am thinking of having the class being mostly discussion based, but I would also like to give them little assignments like essay prompts that they can also peer review with a partner.

Brianges,2021-03-09 17:13:02+00:00,Irish Teachers and pay equality.,"As a pre-service teacher, knowing that some of my future colleagues will be earning more than me for carrying out the same job just because they joined the service before 2011 irks me so much. But what can even be done? It's super disheartening... This has been an ongoing controversy for 10 years now, with 2 payscales penalising all newly qualified teachers, especially those with existing qualifications."
Available-Lobster-94,2021-03-09 17:04:55+00:00,Forgivable Loans?,Hi :) I'm wondering if anyone on here has any experience with forgivable loans specific to teaching? Are they as straight forward as they seem or are there a million loopholes where you end up having to repay the loan despite continuing to teach in a public/underserved school?
_l_a_n_270,2021-03-09 16:25:57+00:00,Can anyone relate- co teacher doesn’t do SHIT,"Hi all- I’ve seen other people post about their experiences with their co-teachers and I need to share mine before I legit lose my mind today.  Last year before remote learning, I had one of the math teachers (there’s two in my school) as my co. We had some communication issues but we worked well together. Now because of programming- I got switched to the other math teacher. 

My new co-teacher is much older. He has been in the system for over 13 years I think (along time). He constant talks at me but doesn’t do anything (and I mean anything at all). I’m the SPED teacher and he teaches math. Naturally I’m talented in math so I don’t need much direction with the material. However, I feel like I’m doing his job and mine. I plan all the lessons, I wrote the curriculums for his classes, I do everything. Grade, make the assignments, etc. everything we are both suppose to do. Anyway, I’ve tried so many strategies with him with making a template and having him fill it out, making google common folders, making videos with by step directions on how to use certain platforms, and even having conversations with him and admin. 

I’m burnt out. I feel bad that he recently had Covid. He was out for a month. Before he was out, he told me he was caught up on grading. In that month, I come to find out he didn’t grade anything at all. Grades were due so I had to do all this grades from the beginning of the YEAR! I’m burnt out. I’m tired. I’m happy I’m working from home so I can turn him off but all he does is bark orders at me all day and do absolutely NOTHING. The thought of working with him in the building next year fills me with dread. I’m so unhappy. Can he please just retire? I miss I was with the other math teacher so bad. My mental health is really suffering."
jett330,2021-03-09 13:28:49+00:00,I have an interview with a charter school tomorrow. What are some good questions to ask?,What are some things I don’t realize about working at a charter school?
se528491,2021-03-09 12:36:07+00:00,Why are they confused???,"I think it’s just something I have to learn with time but one of my biggest weaknesses is understanding where my students are confused when they can’t articulate what they are struggling with. Or I just don’t address their questions correctly because I misinterpret what they’re saying? 

Like the other day I tried to explain to my student that she plugged in the wrong value for a variable that she identified above the work, but she just wasn’t getting it. It was as simple as “you plugged in the wrong value for c” but then my teacher (I’m just a student teacher) said “you have the wrong y-int, the y-int is c.” 

Am I dumb?? I don’t understand how she didn’t understand my explanation but understood my teacher’s which seemed like a more complex thing to grasp. I hate that I can’t understand what they need help with sometimes."
SpicyGingerCake,2021-03-09 11:47:31+00:00,Doing the PGCE was the worst mistake I ever made.,"I'm burnt out. I'm exhausted. I start working at 8 and stop working to sleep at 1 in the morning. It seems like nothing I ever make for these classes is good enough, no lesson delivery is good enough. In order to take a day off for exhaustion, I need to wake up even earlier to tell them so. I feel like such a failure. It just never ends, I don't have any time that isn't devoted to work anymore. I haven't had time to cook a real meal in months. But there's only three months left of this goddam qualification that I've spent thousands on, so I can't quit, but I'm scared I'm going to make myself miserable until June and still fail the course. I like teaching. I like working with the pupils, but each PowerPoint I make takes hours because there's always something wrong with it. I'm so done. I'm always on the verge of crying. I hate this."
AffectionateCap4118,2021-03-09 02:42:06+00:00,Feel like a bad tutor,"I have been tutoring privately on the side for a family with a 10-year old for about 3 months now, and I feel like I haven’t been helping him improve at all. The marks he brings back are still below average. I know that depending on the child, they learn at different paces, but I feel bad that what I’m doing doesn’t seem to be helping and that the turn-out has disappointed the mom. I’m always super attentive and I ask him a lot of questions, which he likes to respond to with “I don’t know”, so I give him time to think and I try to help by using prompting questions before explaining the answer to him in simple terms, but I’m never sure if he quite understands because he doesn’t ever seem interested in asking questions. He likes to go off-topic a lot and talk seemingly non-stop about gaming, to which I try to redirect the conversation to the studying material, but it takes some time for him to let it drop. And after I feel he understands the concepts when he answers the practice questions right, he tends to forget everything we went through by the following session, and forget to do the homework I assign him. I know he’s a really smart kid, but I feel like part of the problem is that he doesn’t care. Could I get some advice on how I can improve my skills as a tutor in this situation?"

caseydaisy,2021-03-08 15:27:02+00:00,"I tested positive for COVID, but I’m teaching virtually.","On Sunday, I tested positive for covid so I felt comfortable taking off today, Monday. My symptoms are mostly mild, but coming in waves. I’m also 13 weeks pregnant.

Today, my throat is sore, my voice is nearly gone, and I feel tired.

I also struggle with anxiety and impostor syndrome feelings, which lead to complicated feelings about attendance at work, especially at a high-performing school with high expectations for teacher attendance.

How long is it reasonable to take off work, considering:
- we’re teaching remotely so I’m no danger to anyone
- I’d like to preserve some leave for pregnancy and healthy child checkups
- I didn’t think to ask urgent care where I got my rapid test for a doctor’s note (could I ask my OBGYN to provide one?)
- I don’t know how much I’m not able to teach vs. my anxiety is telling me I’m not able to teach vs. my anxiety telling me I’m being lazy and should get back to work ASAP


I guess it also depends on my district, but I’m pretty sure it’s a standard three+ days requires a doctor’s note.

Part II I didn’t know I was in for:
Thanks for your advice and trying to sympathize with the inner workings of an anxious/impostor mind. (Also any advice about this, especially as I begin to care for another human soon, is more than welcome.

I’ve seen 4 different therapists/counselors in the past 5 years about numerous struggles, but most seem to just listen and not push me to try new strategies, give me “homework,” or hold me accountable in any way. Even when I try to ask for that awkwardly, I still feel unchallenged. I feel better on the whole afterward, but not motivated to make real change.

Am I looking for the wrong kind of therapist? It is positively exhausting finding one with openings who “fits” you."

Kt-Strauberry,2021-03-07 14:29:28+00:00,COVID Friendly Phys-Ed Games and Activities,"Hey, new teacher here!  Graduated June 2020 (in the middle of the shit storm lol), and just got an LTO in a 2/3 split.  Its my first time being back in the class since my last placement in March 2020 (which was cut short) so the COVID teaching world is new to me.

The biggest thing I’m struggling with is phys ed.  I want to take my kids out every day either for phys ed or just some dpa but the covid rules in my board are no physical contact (ovi) and no equipment.  The no equipment is stumping me the most.  When we have snow, building is definitely a great option.  I’ve also bought a massive pack of sidewalk calk (from indigo of all places!  60 pack for $15!) That I will split up and the kids can keep theirs in a plastic bag in their desk so we can draw things on the ground like hop scotch, or circles for playing rock paper scissors queen.

Does anyone have any resources or other games or activities I can do with my students (preferably outside) without equipment or physical contact?  Anything is helpful!"
quelayla,2021-03-05 07:42:43+00:00,I resigned and I got berated for it.,"So, I resigned, and my principal has been awful about it. Claimed I'd ""used"" her (yeah, right, because I've asked for fucking nothing I'm not entitled to by contract and put in way more than is required, just like every teacher). Told me off (yes, like a child) for emailing my resignation rather than booking a meeting with her. I've always worked corporate and we always formally email resignations, so I did what I knew to do. And hello...I heard precisely what happened last year when someone had a meeting with her to resign, why the hell was I going to walk into her screaming at me!

Furthermore, I sought advice about my resignation from a senior, trusted staff member in confidence who also told me the way forward was to resign in email and then await the summons. Well, the summons didn't come, just a brief, rude conversation in the staffroom at break in which she attacked me while at the same time saying, ""this is not the time or place for this"" and when I offered a meeting thinking she might just want to vent some more at me in private, she said no, she had nothing more to say. So really, she simply wanted to tell me off to save her own fucking ego in her own little mind. I think less of her now than I ever did before, but then that has been waning for some time, too. I wish I could tell her that if she wants to be approached, she should be approachable. But she's the ice queen.

I was told by a student last year that her nickname amongst students at her previous school was ""Ice"" and I'm sure it's through the student body here now, too. The seniors this year hate her with a passion. She undermined their senior pledge, outright rejecting their idea and replacing it with one of her own. The ridiculous part is that their pledge was a part of the school brand, being ""wellbeing"" except in the indigenous language. For someone who has been pushing embracing indigenous culture and language, why she rejected that is beyond me, and the seniors. They are salty as fuck.

So, this is my rant, and I'm glad I'm leaving. I'm sure my new school will have its own culture problems, I have an inkling of them already, but at least it won't be an egomanical, snobby, rude principal."

Bearsquish,2021-03-05 01:39:49+00:00,Questions about Master myths and induction programs from a student teacher!,"Hi! I’m a student teacher on my last leg trying to get the edtpa done through CA. 

Due to some odd circumstances I may be moving to WA at the end of the year. 

Recently in my final classes my professors were discussing going into a master program through the school, I doubt I would be able to attend from far away but mostly I was concern that with a teacher shortage on the brink schools may not be hiring new teachers with Masters because of the extra cost. I was told this is a myth, is that true? Or are they just trying to get me to enroll into THEIR masters program?

I was also curious about how the induction programs into a school works with a masters, would it be easier to get the masters first or go finish the induction program as a teacher?"

Braden675,2021-03-04 01:24:52+00:00,"Anyone have a ""Neanderthal"" school board?","My school board thinks with less than two months left in the academic year we need to reopen suddenly in person despite the logistical nightmare it will create. They can't get our special online academy going that is separate from distance learning, but think this will work in such a short time remaining.

There is a special meeting right now to discuss it. I wrote a long letter opposing reopening to summer term because it only three months away and is easier to implement during. Not to mention wouldn't be as unproductive or wasteful as a plan. 

Who else has a Neanderthal school board like this right now valuing politics over employees or people?"

I never really was censored away from things growing up, as long as I didn’t copy or say anything I seen from R rated stuff. 

BUT, obviously we have to adhere to the rules. I put on Nuke’s Top 5 for them, but all the creepy channels I watch have F bombs and such. Like Mr Nightmare is great, but he doesn’t censor things which is a problem when I know these kids would enjoy it, but I don’t want to get in trouble by my supervisor. 

I was told that all PG-13 movies are perfectly fine, but these are 11 year olds. Their attention span not is very long, nor is mine, which is why I pull up YouTube so when we collectively get bored I just go to another video.

foxytigerduckfire,2021-03-02 18:32:43+00:00,Grading problems,"My mom's a 2nd grade teacher and I have been assisting her with various things this year because of all the challenges. At the beginning of the year, the kids were all virtual and the didn't have equal access to devices or internet connection. Many of them didn't get ChromeBooks from the school until January (and internet access can still be an issue for some). In the middle of the 2nd quarter, some of the kids we're brought in for hybrid learning while others stayed virtual. After a few weeks, it went back to all virtual. Starting in February, they are back to some students doing hybrid schedules where they're in person about 80% of the time, while about half the class is still virtual.

With all this happening, it's been challenging to get kids to turn in work. My mother tried to be kind to them grade-wise for the first couple quarters because of all of the challenges, but by now, there's really no excuse for them not turning things in. She's told them she needs at least 2 assignments per week per subject turned in in order to get a fair assessment. She turned out a missing assignment list asking for specific work. She's asked the parents for help. She's made it so they can turn in homework online, in person, or by taking pictures and texting, but they still aren't completing work.

They grade on a 5 point scale based on the kids' abilities to demonstrate understanding of the standards, so when there's no work turned in, it's hard to fairly measure their progress. Many of them were behind coming into this school year and she's finding it difficult to be able to catch them up. She's also falling behind in the curriculum that needs to be covered because she's been trying to catch them up and get them to submit work and because the school schedule has changed so much.

So, how are you guys handling grading? Are students turning in work consistently? How are you making it fair? Are you keeping up with curriculum? Are students behind from the interruption at the end of last year?

Thanks for all you guys do for your classes and for any pointers."

'then I guess you and your family clearly don't have any respect for anyone but yourselves' 

Finally what I wanted to say to a para after I mistakenly thought I could vent to them about students insisting there should be a white history month, but instead I just stood there dumfounded;
'Saying ""some black people say so too,"" about a comment which may sound bigotted to some, only makes you sound like a bigger more ignorant bigot, (unless you are a black person saying other black people think so too but this was said by a white women). If y'all want to flip the script, ignoring that white people are the ones with the systemic power (who wrote most of the history books we use in school) then tell me this, would it ever make any sense at all to say ""some white people say so too""? 
No! it would just sound like nonsense being blown out your ass, pretty much no matter what the sercomstances was, so why do you think it's any less stupid to say that about a minority group?!? 

Just in case of back lash, I'm not talking about quoting someone directly, that would be far more appropriate than ""some black people say...""  followed by racist misinterpretations of thing that might have been said by notable POC but is probably just the racist's way of convincing themself they aren't a racist.

Advice?,"I’m a high school language teacher at a charter school and I’m getting my MAT simultaneously—or, I was, until my job told me that I had to use my PTO to attend my graduate-school courses. Some background on my job: my workday ends at 5, but the students are now done with school at 1:30, when before the pandemic and they were in person, their school day was until 4. Teachers are meant to stick around to be available to them for “office hours” which maybe 4 children total visit virtually every week.

When I first started working there pre-pandemic, they allowed me to leave early (4:30, when there were no children around) without taking my PTO, which put me in an extremely tight squeeze having to take the trains etc, but I made it work. Now, when the children are out of the building early (but teachers still have to stay)  I was told I had to take PTO for wanting to walk home (a 30-minute trek away) to have the privacy to take my classes so I can be certified to work at my school.

Obviously, I think this is unnecessary. I want to be certified, and I thought my school would be interested in having a certified teacher in my subject around as there are very few of these in my field; the subject I teach mostly shows up at private &amp; parochial schools. On top of that, I’m the only teacher in this subject that they’ve had stay for longer than a year before leaving; other teachers in my subject around the city know the school’s reputation for high turnover, so my school struggles to fill this position, which is a subject required for them to offer as per their charter. Mid years are coming up, and I’ve learned that my pay is now being affected by my not being certified. 

Is this a normal practice at schools and I’m just whining, or do you think I can negotiate that they do not take my PTO—already precious, as we no longer have COVID leave— in my contract renewal meeting? Thanks in advance for your fair advice."

I created this simple website for her to create beautiful annotated presentations and share them with students.

Each annotation can be a simple note, or something that links to external resource so that the students can read more around the subject.

Since she and her students loved it so much, I decided to share it with everyone. 

It's also good for a student to create notes so then can refer them later as well. You can also share the link to a presentation with your students or colleagues, so they can view it as well.

I plan on adding flashcards, polls and more in future.

I'm a junior in college right now, majoring in general social science and history, and I'm planning on going on to grad school to get my teaching license. I've always liked school, and I've always known I would end up back in school for work at some point, but I've also always suffered from social anxiety. When I would have to get up in front of a class and give a presentation, I would always freeze up, and I have all the typical ""bad"" speech qualities (pacing, stuttering, going too fast due to nervousness, freezing up, etc). However, I don't want this to stop me from being a teacher. I'm wondering if anyone else here had to overcome their social anxiety to be able to teach, and if so, what steps they took to overcome it.

Also if anyone is curious, I've done a decent amount of volunteering including leading activities for students in a classroom, so I do have a little experience in a classroom and I know teaching is for me. That's why I'm asking about how to overcome my anxiety and not if I should even pursue teaching or not."

fruhlingsblumen1,2021-02-25 14:37:06+00:00,Feeling like it’s time to stop,"Apologies for the long post but my situation is specific! 
I’m an kindergarten assistant teacher at a private school. This is my first time teaching in a traditional school setting. My background and passion is mostly in theatre, but I taught classical theatre to young people for the past couple of years pre-pandemic, but i was laid off like most theatre artists. 
When I moved back home due to this, I got my current job. Going into it, I expected that being an assistant meant being present for the kids and taking care of them throughout the day, giving the classrooms care and working on administrative/busy work for the teachers. 
When I started, I was asked to teach a 25 minute lesson because the teachers were teaching something else at the same time. I said okay, not really knowing or understanding what this all meant or really that it was a daily lesson. It was my very first week at this place and I had no idea what I was getting into. 

i’ve continued teaching the lesson and I try to have fun with it. But it’s very stressful to be doing something I am not qualified for. Since this, i’ve been asked to do a lot of extra things in my job and I am being used as a third teacher in many ways, while still making assistant salary. I got a small raise, but it doesnt make up for the toll on my mental health. My days have become really exhausting because of the amount of things i’ve been asked to do, while my lead teachers’ only feedback when asked has been hurtful and microaggressive (I’m the only Black teacher at the school). 

I feel stuck. I cannot stop thinking and talking about school after I leave. I wake up sobbing and I try to find ways to make things better but I have no energy and nothing is working. I’m depressed and haven’t felt truly happy since winter break. I know I don’t want to do this but I feel bad quitting because the kids really really love me (I’m a naturally empathetic and fun person to be around, and I talk to them like people) and so do the parents. Can anyone help me in any way?"

(5081),"So, I need to take the 5081 exam to get into graduate school to become a teacher. I was quite worried based off of what I read here on how hard/easy it was and so I bought some resources including the practice exams.

I just took one to see where I might be and how hard it theoretically is.. I got 77 right and 58 wrong (lol). But, according to Google, I take 77 right out of 130 and get 59.23% which to get to the out of 200 scale they do, you simply add 100 and so I'd have gotten 159 (or 160 or 158 depending on up or down rounding) and in the state of Kansas all you need is 158.

That's cutting it close and I know the practice exam isn't the actual test but it's a major confidence boost that without studying for one minute, I passed the practice exam.. albeit barely. It's also shocking you could miss 58 questions and still pass.

Is this accurate? Thoughts?

I'm also circling the room like a helpful shark, giving praise and advice.

It's such a lovely way to start the day, you guys. It seems to help them get into the learning mindset first thing - cursive is a very grown-up skill, and progress is easy for them to discern. Plus, not only do the kids love learning it, I've had at least a half dozen parents thank me for teaching it.

dunkinqueef,2021-02-24 22:58:33+00:00,Horrible student teaching experience,"Ah, the joys of student teaching during covid. As if teaching virtually through this experience isn't bad enough, my mentor teacher is a bitch from hell who only ever tells me what I'm doing wrong and never what I'm doing right.

The school district doesn't have the budget to give student teachers school-issued laptops, which is already annoying enough in itself that I have to use my own technology for work. My shitty macbook only has one USB-C port so it's very difficult to use the elmo document camera because when I use the converter with it, my computer dies since I can't be simultaneously charging. Because of this, my computer died mid-instruction and I had to borrow my mentor's laptop to finish the math lesson. She was extremely angry and said I made her ""very frustrated"" and ""needed to stop asking for so much help."" This is a common pattern - critiquing things like the technology aspect (which I'm learning and doing my goddamn best with) and gives me no feedback on my actual teaching. I KNOW I'm a qualified teacher because my mentor at my last placement (and all others I've worked with) have told me so, yet my current woman writes me horrible reviews for making innocent mistakes with things like technology. How am I supposed to learn if she gets so angry with me every time I make a mistake? Student teaching is supposed to be about taking risks and learning, not constantly feeling like I'm walking on eggshells and terrified of disappointing.

After the incident, I said ""I'm so sorry this happened. It won't happen again"" to which she responded ""How can you know that? You can never predict when you're going to make a mistake. Don't say that to me."" Like...? What else do you want me to say then? And if you acknowledge that it's a 'mistake' why are you yelling at me and writing me horrible feedback reviews?

I am very discouraged. And also nervous that this bitch is going to ruin all of my job prospects and all I've worked towards for years will be for nothing. \*pours wine\*"

I had an unannounced 90 minute observation yesterday.  The notes I got were horrendous.  
I am teaching hybrid (13 in person, 9 online simultaneously).  We’ve been hybrid for a month. The first half of the year was completely remote. 
Some of the highlights were that I was “fluctuating between the in class kids and the computer kids” (um
Yea.  That’s how it works.  Don’t get the choice of words though...)
That kids didn’t raise their hands enough (there was some calling out but it was a discussion &amp; I wasn’t concerned).  I have the toughest group in the building (as mentioned by the rest of the staff). 
There were so many negative things he pointed out.  It was truly disheartening.  He said the floor was messy (we have art in the room and the teacher ran over her time- so they hadn’t cleaned up yet).  
He commented on the fact that all of my “polices and procedures” are not listed or posted on the wall.  And that one kid got pissy and put his head down on his desk.  (I’ll take that over an outburst any day). He also noted that three kids were on their computers (which is seen as a negative- yet it’s required for the math program we have.) 

No mention of the fact that we just started working on some new things and the last two days have been the best my kids have had since we’ve been back.  No mention of the fact that a kid that has outbursts almost daily had an amazing day with his new “work for chart”.  No mention that the kids were excited about their math skills. 
Did he not see same lessons I saw?  The kids were working, answering questions, working on multiplication and getting excited that they got it. We were quietly laughing and joking a bit.  They all handed in their work, aside from one kid.  Then for reading they did a great job with learning how to use a new reading notebook. They came up with great points about the character from our mentor text .  They took notes and shared their ideas.   
Sigh.  It’s never enough.  This just sucks.  I have over 15 years experience as a teacher.  Yet I find myself truly wondering what other jobs to apply for."

I have signed up for the NES Subtests, and I just took the practice test for II. I got about \~87% in each section, but I only missed one out of 7-8 Qs in each section. How do you think that will translate to the actual NES test? I'm just wondering how much preparation I should be looking at to ensure a passing score. Anybody else score around the \~85% range on the practice tests? How'd your score look on the real thing? Thanks!"

Difficulty-Boring,2021-02-22 17:41:04+00:00,"Hey fellow teachers, I gotta get this off my chest","Hi. This is long, but I just need to do it. I’ve posted here before. 24, teacher from the US; IL to be exact. I’ve just gotta vent. Currently we are on lunch break and I’m just feeling so so so defeated this year. I feel like a terrible teacher, I feel like my poor firsties are going to go to second grade unprepared. I feel like I’m doing everything I can, but still not enough. 

It’s so frustrating to be a teacher because the pressure is insane— a lot of people don’t realize this. The pressure to move kids further along academically, even amongst ALL OF THE BARRIERS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. Like come on and give me a break here. Internet issues, connection, digital exhaustion, parent schedules and availability, lack of resources, and just the fact that we are still experiencing and trying to survive through a pandemic here!!! It’s all so tough to navigate and while I know it’s out of my control somehow it still seems like I’m at fault. ON TOP OF THE SHIT PAY. I mean come on. I feel like I work my life away sometimes for the barest of the bare minimum. From admin, parents, hell even my own friends and family still think I’m a babysitter. It’s infuriating because I think to myself: do you want to work that hard and burn yourself out year after year after year just to be paid shit and at the same time be looked down on by society?? I’m not looking for praise, just respect. I feel like we deserve more, so much more. It just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the mental strain, the constant scrutiny, the constant criticism from those that have NO IDEA what’s it’s like to be us. 

I’m in my 3rd year and I’m already questioning how much more I can take. I’m not sure this profession is even good for my mental health at this point. It sucks because this is what I wanted my WHOLE life (in 1st grade I decided I was gonna do this) and now I’m wondering why I didn’t choose a different path. I LOVE the kids and the bonds, my coworkers are great, but at some point burn out really does set in. This is not to discourage pre-service teachers either. Fight the good fight for sure, I’m just tired man. Just tired. I’m all over the place. I guess I just needed to say that. Would love some words of encouragement or positivity. Also if I need to get out while I can, you can say that too. Take care friends, I hope you are all well!"

uhohoreolas,2021-02-22 16:28:46+00:00,Considering moving from classroom to counseling and would like advice,"I'll get right down to it: I am not thrilled with the way schools and school systems are handling mental health. I definitely think there has been a large step in the right direction, but as an elementary classroom teacher, I am often frustrated by the lack of time and resources that students with mental health issues are being given. I could go on about how I wish I personally had more time and resources to help, but to keep it brief, I would like advice on whether or not going the route of a counselor is worth it and if anyone has found success with the process. 
I have a bachelor's in K-6, so I would definitely need to go back to school to get my masters in counseling. I like the idea that I could stay in education but also be able to move into private counseling as I get older (I'm in my 3rd year teaching). 

I tend to be an impulsive person and really would appreciate some advice! I know many of us have been thinking of career changes after this year and I'm hoping this isn't a ""grass is greener"" moment for me. If there is a better sub to ask this, please let me know that too. Thanks!"

I have no formal degree or training around education.

I have been unable to find a crystal clear resource that outlines the path to become a teacher when I have degrees, but not in education.

This appears to be a 2-year program where ""candidates teach full time for two school years under the mentorship and coaching of an experienced teacher.""

Is the above program all I need to do? Do I get paid for the two years I am teaching in the program? Are there any quicker alternatives? Do I need this license to teach at private schools/would they hire someone without it?

Lonely_Bit_6844,2021-02-22 08:26:31+00:00,Not sure about teaching. What else can I do?,"I am having a bit of a career path crisis. I studied journalism and worked in that field for a few years, while I love writing, I found my job in newspaper journalism (where I ended up) too stressful. I taught English abroad for a few years and though it was also quite chaotic I enjoyed working with children and being a bit fun and theatrical. Came home and didn't know what to do, after some deliberation I decided to do a postgraduate certificate in teaching (2 years). For some reason I imagined teaching as a relatively calm profession, with kind and gentle colleagues. I suffer from generalized anxiety and OCD and am trying to learn to work with myself and not put myself in situations that are not good for me. Through practical work I have found teaching to be more stressful than I thought, and people that work with children less kind and supportive than I thought. I am tempted to quit my studies (I am halfway though), but reluctant to throw away the last year of hard work, so now I am wondering, is there any alternative for someone like me, with a writing background and teaching certification? Like some kind of educational writer/textbook author etc? Please, any suggestions are welcome :)

honey__vee,2021-02-20 06:05:47+00:00,TEA gave every school in the state of Texas 3 free bad weather days that we wouldn't have to make up at the end of the year. My district didn't take any of them.,"I'm a first year teacher in a small school located in West Texas. As most everyone has heard by now, Texas was hit with an insane snow storm that has caused water outages, rolling blackouts due to an energy crisis, and many deaths across the state. The area I live in has had a consistent 6+ inches of snow on the ground for an entire week (which is record breaking in Texas). The roads have been iced over and slushy at best. People in the surrounding area have lost power and/or water in these extreme low temps.

Due to this extreme weather, TEA gave everyone 3 free bad weather days so that we could stay home and stay safe. But what did my school do? Made everyone come in at 8:00 for a full day of school on Tuesday morning after Presidents day and drive through the ice and snow. Not even a late start!! So then, when we get news that we're next on the list of possible blackouts to conserve power, the school tells us we'll have a late start on Wednesday and we'll only go home if the power is off for more than an hour. Well that's great! We only have to freeze our butts off for an hour before we get to go home. So the snowmageddon continues, but we never lose power (thankfully, but the weather was still horrible) and administration decides we don't need a late start for Thursday, so come on in at 8:00 again! It's not like the roads are even slushier than before due to the melting and refreezing that's been occurring for the past week! Today was the first day that the sun actually came out and I didn't have to pry my garage door open just to get to school on time. We could have stayed home and stayed safe Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and NEVER have to make up those days and then showed up on Friday when it was warm and safe!!! Literally every other school in a hundred mile radius closed for at least one day and most did late starts for the rest.

And to top it all off, when one of my fellow teachers asked my principal why we weren't using the free bad weather days, he said he'd never heard of those until she mentioned them. This means either 1- The superintendent never told the principals about them to keep it under wraps and hope no one noticed or 2- He absolutely knew about them and lied to her face to make it seem like he's not the bad guy.

I'm exhausted, I'm cold, I'm emotionally drained, and most of all, I'm tired of getting jerked around by a school that doesn't give a shit about protecting it's teachers and students."
calitay18,2021-02-20 02:12:33+00:00,Masters degree?,"This is my 2nd year of teaching and I’m not 100% sure it’s for me. Mainly, because I’ve been teaching middle school when my heart is more with primary. So I hope when I get a primary position my love for education is sparked again. HOWEVER, I’m curious about keeping my options open. I want to get my masters as it helps with getting a higher pay, especially in the long run if I stick with teaching as a life long career. What I’m curious about is does your masters have to be related to education to get that bump up on the pay scale? Or could you essentially have a masters in anything and still move up on the salary schedule? Does anyone have a masters in something not education related and can speak to this?"

I now fully understand the money I make, will make, and what my future will hold with a career as a teacher. I don’t have a “plush” life, I get by paycheck to paycheck with a little to save. Frankly, I’d really like to make more money and I don’t want to go back to college. 

I love teaching! It really does make me happy to work with kids and feel like I am making a difference. With that being said, recently I was approached by a good friend. He owns and operates a boys group home that serves at risk youth and loves it! He loves it for all of the same reasons I love teaching:helping kids, teaching them to be better, and doing something meaningful. It’s a vastly different job but I feel holds a lot of similarities to teaching. 
He is looking to expand his agency and open more homes. He said he immediately thought of me when he wanted to expand and felt I’d be great at this. He broke down the numbers and I’d be making double what I make as a teacher! 

I am curious what you’d do if given an opportunity like this?

I know that I can always teach if I keep my license current. I do love teaching, I really do, but with the poor pay and the current online environment I am constantly thinking of ways I can make more money because what I (we) make now isn’t enough. I couldn’t support a family on what I make now."
peterpanalot,2021-02-18 16:47:47+00:00,My philosophy is changing,"I can feel my philosophy towards education changing and I think it is taking a cynical turn. 

I am a math teacher for a high school setting and I teach a class that is basically an advanced version of Algebra 2. The students that are in that class should be students trying to get prepared for higher math, but it's a mix of students with a variety of needs. 

Today, they were talking to me about a student that wants to drop out of school and make music. He says he is going to be in the studio with Kanye in a month and he is going to make it big. It becomes a joke with my students in my class and I definitely overreacted to that situation and started ranting to them about how rap only really gets good if the person is educated or if the rap actually says something meaningful about the life that they live. My students looked surprised that I got so passionate about this topic and I apologized for taking up that time and getting carried away. Then, of course, my students were trying to get me to say more and take up more time, but instead, I told them that we needed to get started with our material today. 

I looked at the board and we were working with graphing lines and I just said to myself ""This seems so stupid now."" Like, I started to think about myself in high school struggling with my sexuality and my friend group. I was so worried about all of that and it caused me to be distracted from my school work, but I haven't thought about that in years. After that moment up at the board, I could tell students were not paying attention to me and were concerned with their own drama in their heads. I felt so worthless standing up there talking about lines. I felt like they honestly didn't care about anything I had to say and I know that is me spiraling, but I just can't get out of my head that anything I do won't even stick in their heads. 

I just felt so defeated in 47 minutes even though my students didn't say/do anything disrespectful and it was all me. Sorry if this didn't make any sense, I just needed a place to vent."
tkcal,2021-02-18 16:32:24+00:00,(Help). Looking for advice on running a discussion moderation class,"Hi everyone

I'm teaching at a university looking to change things up in a class that hasn't been running as well as I'd like. It's a content/skills based class where the main piece of assessment is the moderation of a discussion topic.

We spend time discussing key skills - paraphrasing, reflecting, active listening, inviting participation, open ended questioning...but last semester - especially in an online environment - this really didn't work.

Typically what would happen is that the student/s moderating that week's discussion come with their topic, introduce it and then - however is appropriate for them - invite participation. Might be a controversial statement or question, an ethical conundrum.. a straight up ""how do you feel about this?""...whatever.

It was a very quiet semester. From the safety of their own study's/lounge rooms and behind their screens, the students didn't feel any huge necessity to contribute and as such, a lot of the moderation turned into monologues or increasingly frazzled yes/no questioning.  


It's a model i'd like to change - i just don't quite know how.

I'm toying with the idea of somehow introducing topics myself and then choosing a few students at random to demonstrate skills - but I can see this not being interactive at all. I like and I want a little chaos - it's a good chance to demonstrate some of the key skills - but that's not going to work if I'm steering the ship from the front each week.

Unique_Importance_94,2021-02-18 15:18:19+00:00,TA Should I become a teacher?,"So I graduated with a BS in Middle school math and received a nc teaching license in 2016.  I had anot so good student teaching experience. I got a C+. I tried hard to get a teaching job in one of the biggest counties but faced obstacles and limitations due to not having a car.

 I finally secured amid year TA job that year and continued in that position until the june 2018. I again tried to get a teaching job and had interviews. I was able to secure a long term math sub position for 7th grade. I basically did all the teacher work for sub pay with little support. It was hell especially after the kids found out i was a sub. I ended up switching positions mid year back to a TA at that same school until june 2019. My teaching license expired that month and was non renewable. 

I then had some mental health problems and moved back to eastern nc where i secured various part time jobs. Finally in nov 2020 i was able to get back into the school system as a TA again in a smaller district. I want to try teaching again but it is unlikely I will find a job in this small district as teachers tend to stay until retirement.

Should i continue being a TA for another year and save money so I can move and get a teaching job in a bigger district? Should I consider going outof state to GA maybe?

Basically i think im ready to be a teacher but i also have anxiety about trying to teach so many years after i have been out of my subject and have barely any teaching experience."

belladisordine,2021-02-15 21:06:11+00:00,How do you compartmentalize and care less?,"Hi all, 

I am recovering from another anxiety attack / mental break down because of teaching. 

For the fourth time this school year, my admin has micromanaged and undermined what I teach and how I keep my grades. And I just can't anymore. 

At first, admin extended late work acceptance from one day to five days. OK. 

Then, we were told to drop the three lowest grades (1 day before grades were due and most of us had already submitted final grades.) Awesome. 

Next, we are being told to accept late work up until the week before grades were due and no grades lower than 59% on late work. 

I accepted all of these changes with minimal rebuff because they don't really impact my group of students. I don't have many students failing. 

Where I lost my beans was being told to change my extra credit so that it is the same across 7th grade science grade level. I am the only 7th grade science gifted teacher. So my lessons will cover the same topics as regular level, but obviously I do things a little differently. My extra credit was for students to find four news articles related to our content and summarize them. I think that is worthy of 5 percentage points, which is the value of extra credit. The regular class teacher wants the kids to do ONE take home lab. I do not think that is challenging/engaging enough for my kids. She went to admin, and I'm now being told to do the lab and not my current events. 

I don't know how to let this one go y'all. This other teacher said in private emails that she wants to do the lab because it's easy to grade. She doesn't want to do something that has 4 parts to it. I feel this lab is a disservice to my students. I think it is crucial for them to make connections from our content to the real world. 

I have been continually told to lower my standards for my students this year and I've just had it. I can't let this extra credit thing go. 

I feel like I've disconnected as much as I can already. I don't take work home with me. I don't answer emails outside of school time. I take mental health days for myself.  I've let go my frustrations with the other grading policies. But honestly, this is the proverbial straw that broke my teaching back. 

Any advice?"
Muxika,2021-02-15 21:01:01+00:00,I Teach ELA/Reading Online. I have 75 Students. I have 80 Fs.,"Hi everyone,

I've been teaching in the States for 6 years now and I feel so embarrassed about the performance of my 8th Grade ELA and Intensive Reading students. The majority of my students are failing because they're either not turning in the work or they don't know *how* to turn in the work.

I really want to post the grades as-is for this interim period, so hopefully I can scare some of these students straight, but I believe some think they're going straight to high school, no matter how their semester grades or EOC assessments turn out. Also, admin will NEVER let those grades get published as they are.

I've been collaborating on lesson planning with 2-3 other teachers, and I'd think that my students would perform just as well as the other classes, but they're four times worse!

I don't know what's giving them trouble because I don't see the problems in the work that gets turned in. It's the missing work that's causing the failures.

I've already excluded several assignments from the quarterly interims, so they won't negatively affect those scores, but the failures are still there.

Is anyone else dealing with these similar problems, where you're trying to cut corners and trim the fat from your grade book, but nothing's working?

I'm just so deflated right now."

Finding-Internal,2021-02-13 21:01:25+00:00,"We need more cute, educational videos to drown out the useless banal garbage our kids watch","As a parent, I am so frustrated by the useless garbage my children will park themselves in front of. They are getting too old for the educational kiddie stuff and now I have to contend with puberty-focused shows that are too old for my children, or just let them watch mindless videos of animals doing silly things.  Which are kinda funny and entertaining, but there is a void for things on their mental level (grade school).  

I tried to get my children to actively participate in solving this problem. I told them they might be famous YouTubers one day if they did it, so they agreed. For me it was just good for them to being doing something of variety during quarantine.   

We used their pet parakeet budgies to make videos that combined the ""cute animals"" concept with ""educational"".  The birds are Professor and Student, and they go through trying to teach different things. 

So far as the pilot, we've only touched on basic math. It takes a lot of work to make these videos and to keep the kids engaged. I have them doing all the voices and even doing the recording of the scenes.

But, they're losing momentum. In the beginning they were excited because we sent it off to a bunch of teachers in the local school systems, but apparently that is ""spam"".  So I am turning to our community here.

FIRST off -- I'm sharing so that teachers can perhaps use this as entertaining brain breaks for the students. I've seen what my kids get assigned during virtual learning. I've also seen what they watch at home. The idea is to just give them something educational and entertaining at the same time.

SECOND -- I want our community to subscribe to the channel so I can motivate the kids to do more videos. Once the subscriber numbers start climbing, I'll pitch to them how their fans want more good content and it is their responsibility to produce quality videos to help other kids.

&amp;#x200B;

So I hope this helps others, but of course I hope it helps us too. It is self-promotion, but I am under no delusions that the kids are going to become internet sensations by recording videos of their birds. I just like the idea of the ethic it teaches the kids and showing them amount of work involved in any venture. I am teaching them about video editing as well. I want them to stay as far away from the snapchat, instagram, tiktok ""selfies"" -- producing a good quality video without shamelessly promoting oneself. That said, before I get flamed, people have sent me some really good/beneficial/educational videos from tiktok, so I understand it is not all bad. We just have to work in the general sense and do our best to equip these young ones."

Teaching remotely has been difficult for me, subject-wise.  My field is hands-on and even the best simulations aren’t even passable, in my opinion. 

Prior to covid I had been all for moving some material online but making sure student have the kinesthetic experience that is a required and expected component of the course.  When developing this years ago all my colleagues in the field were like “as long as you don’t put it FULLY online!” Which no prob, I agree with

But after a year of teaching remotely they have all suddenly changed their minds.  This can all be taught fully online, going forward, so they say, with no loss of content quality.

....these are physical things. Like, do you want a nurse or a surgeon who has *only* studied online working on you?

My colleagues say, “well they don’t really need this” (then why is it in the class in the first place?!) or “they’re sure to get that in this other class” (what if that other class is saying the same thing, but if this class?!)

I’m just so frustrated because NONE of the discussion is how these tools could make learning better - NONE- just how it could make scheduling and workload easier.  

When asked point blank how this helps students the most I’ve gotten is a vague “online is the future”

....Kay, but we’re supposed to be training them for the jobs of today, too.

It just drives me up the wall that they don’t realize or don’t care what they are doing not just in regards to the futures of our students, but to the reputation of teachers in general."

Due to living at home with two elderly parents during the pandemic and a desire to stay around here for at least a couple more years until my SO finishes school, as well as admittedly poor networking skills, I haven't been able to secure a job in engineering. Throughout school, I always thought I was more suited to being a teacher, but went for engineering because of family pressure. Now I want to seriously consider becoming a HS math or physics teacher, and am looking for some answers from general teachers and those who went down a similar path.

1) With the pandemic on, is this a really stupid time to start as a teacher. 

2) Will the fact that I never had a job in industry hurt my pay or employment chances. Would a school looking to hire someone from an engineering into teaching background want to see experience in engineering.

3) Is the alternative route the best option, and does it matter what kind of program I use to get the CE.

I don't doubt this isn't an effective way of learning but shouldn't there be some sort of peer to peer engagement, especially when learning has moved online recently? I think teaching platforms like Quizlet should have some social learning involved. That's just my thinking, looking forward to any input."

If you need to grab your kids in order to get your point across, don't be a teacher.  
  
I'm a firm believer in leading by example. So, if we want to raise kind, patient, and compassionate kids, we need to be kind, patient and compassionate ourselves. Yes, be stern when needed. Lord knows I have to be stern on occasion. But not once have I ever had to yell at a child, nor would I. It is poor behavior and sets a bad example.

A lot of different aspects have come into play for the career path I set myself on that are making me reconsider a career change from engineering to teaching (I originally considered it when I was graduating high school in 2014, but my parents strongly disapproved of it).

When you work in the computational side of the imaging sciences industry, where you have to create a visual representation of biological phenomena, you are expected to be self-motivated to create that picture that can convey a deeper meaning for doctors and researchers. In order to do this, you have to take part of two industries: biomedical engineering and software development. I love the theory behind it all, but I'm getting burnt out by the environment and the job search/grad school search I have been on. It's partly due to the specific company I work for, where there has been a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a caste-like system of roles in the lab depending on how many degrees you have. There's so many politics and cockiness about whether you have a PhD or not. My job is in this weird, obscure intermediate level where I get to interact a lot more with private investigators and be in touch with pretty high up professionals and scientists, but **I also teach technicians and engineers that are the 'lower' (hate saying that) level how to use a software development kit from a start-up company that we started a contract/collaboration with right before I started in August of 2019. This is the part that I enjoy the most out of my job, and I've gotten so many remarks about how I'm good at helping others learn and to feel motivated.**

**This is what I would want to get out of something I do 40 hours a week. That was about 20% of my job before, and now, because of a shift in responsibilities, pretty much 100% is writing software to translate some imaging analyses into the aforementioned start-up company's cloud service that I had to take on and learn and teach others about. Both the primary lab I work for and the start-up are overly ambitious and get so caught up in it, that there is a lack of documentation on how their commands and software work and I find myself just cranking out test commands and scripts and going back and forth on StackOverflow and suggesting what to write up in their documentation for a niche programming solution that best fits the needs at a very present time. It feels like I am working for two companies that just get a kick out of me doing their grunt work, and it's been very draining. Sometimes I'm not treated well about it either because I sometimes don't fully understand their original intentions behind the specific command.**

I still really like engineering and learning about how the research comes together, but so far in my path, I have to force myself to be a professional whose purpose is to only fulfill the grants of a select few rather than the growth of potentially a higher amount of others. I'm also realizing I'm at my happiest when I'm not on the computer as much anymore except for when I'm interacting with others. I'm isolated in my niche position and even more so as the result of my shift and the general direction in which I am headed (and COVID as well making everything remote). Looking around at jobs hasn't been any more hopeful for me, and I'm not as invigorated by the prospects as I used to be. Especially if the research is what kept me going, but I know I'm not the one to go for a PhD already (so don't recommend that for me). I know I can still read papers about it in free time.

Would going back to getting a teaching certification in HS Science (probably chemistry) be a good step? Is that a crazy, unrealistic move? Because of the initial reaction I had with my parents scoffing at me (and wasting my 'potential') I worry what others may think, as shallow as that sounds. I'm thinking of doing a MS that couples the student teaching and getting a degree and cert at the same time. I'm from PA in case anyone needs to know either.

Thanks in advance for reading my novel :)

**TL:DR; I'm not getting what I originally envisioned in software development/neuroimaging because of my tasks and the environments I have been in. But I have enjoyed being somewhat of an 'instructor' role in my positions, and have in the past considered being a HS teacher. Is this a crazy move? And what would you recommend?**"

_______________77,2021-02-11 00:31:03+00:00,I don’t what level I want to teach...and I’m wondering if it’s worth it to teach at all.,"I’m a college sophomore and I’m at a crossroads when it comes to what I want to do as a career.

I’ve been interested in teaching for a while, specifically history as I love the subject and sharing that love and also helping students learn and grow seems like a very fulfilling job. However I’m unsure. When it comes to grade school teaching (I would be interested to teach on the high school level) I hear and read so much about how it’s awful.( It doesn’t pay enough, you’re overworked, disposable, parents and administrators don’t respect you, burn out is very likely etc.)  so I’m kinda rethinking teaching high schoolers. 

I am more interested, however, to teach at the post-secondary level yet I read that getting a full time job is near impossible as most institutions are hiring at only the part time level and tenure positions are highly competitive.I’m honestly not picky, I’d be fully content teaching at a community college but even that doesn’t seem likely. Teaching at a college would also leave me torn because I’m extremely against the cost of college in the US and teaching at an institution that (in my personal opinion) is completely taking advantage of students financially wouldn’t sit well with me. 

I would also strongly prefer to teach in a larger city (like Chicago, LA, NYC etc. I prefer urban over rural) I feel like that might not help me either.

I could use some advice if possible."

thesadoptomist,2021-02-10 22:57:11+00:00,What are your Policies for late work?,"I just started teaching in a classroom this November. I teach 6th grade science and my classes are hybrid (about 7 kids in person and 20 on zoom). My schools science department is pretty strict on not allowing kids to turn in work late. They tell me I shouldn't give extra credit or let kids redo tests or even do corrections. And if the kids turn in things late, they say I have to take off points or not accept it at all. 

I disagree with that philosophy. These kids are 11 and are having a way more difficult time than any of us have ever had due to COVID. My goal as a teacher is to have my kids learn and I think they'd be able to do that better in a stress free environment. I never take off points for late work and allow them to do corrections occasionally. Of course some may take advantage of this, but in my limited experience most have not. They respect me because I respect them. 

However, I recognize that this may be naive of me. I am in florida so I didnt have to go to school for teaching or even get a masters in order to teach in the classroom, so I dont have a formal teaching education. Plus, my coworkers have way more years of experience than I do so I cannot deny they know more than me. 

I was wondering what your thoughts on this was and how you handle late work and test corrections in your classrooms. Any thoughts would be appreciated :)

Tldr; what is your classroom policy on latework/test corrections? Do you think it is bad to let kids turn in work late with no penalties."

- in the same period, I made a student cry because I said she’s a kind, warm person who’s doing a great job
- another student in that class who has been feeling low because her friend died a month ago. She talked to her very supportive mum after school who called me to ask how to support her
- in my period 2 class, I managed to get 1:1 time with a highly anxious student who loves my Japanese classes. By lunchtime she was practicing her Japanese with strangers.
- in my free period, I checked in on a student who I spent an hour with the other day organising his books and I was very happy to see he took all his new books to class
- at lunch I helped a current student who will certainly be a future teacher to run a Japanese club- her first time doing so
- in my last period of the day, I spoke to a boy who’s been having trouble with his friends feel that he has a teacher who cares about him
- and during all that I helped train a new teacher who did a really good job

I recently graduated with a BS in Fisheries and Wildlife. After much consideration and research, I’ve decided I want to pursue the middle-high route, specially in biology. 
All applications for Oregon programs, however, require teaching experience and many of those applications require a reference to back up the teaching experience. I have worked as a wildlife educator at a zoo where I talked about animals on stage, but it was a weird situation where my supervisor never saw me teach. I also volunteered VERY briefly a few years as a “mentor” where I helped kids after school with their homework. I only volunteered for a couple of months, once a week, before I went back to college. Would these positions count towards this “teaching experience” that’s required?
Also, if you went through a Masters program in Oregon, which school did you attend and how was you experience?

Thank you!"

I currently work at a charter school that is essentially a sinking ship. Lots of layoffs, declining enrollment rate, all the fun stuff that pretty much has this school ready to close in the next few years if things don’t change. 
My mother in law told me that there are jobs at a local public school opening up this coming fall as a bunch of teachers are retiring. I want to throw my name in the hat, but I’m unsure of how to do so since the jobs technically hasn’t been posted yet, but from the sounds of it people are already applying. 
Some people have told me I should just send my resume to them anyways, some say I should mail it, and some people have told me I should go in person. I have a few questions about this:
1. Is it bad to send my resume and stuff in in the middle of the school year? Does it show I’m unprofessional or noncommittal?
2. If I do send it in, do I take it in person or mail it? Should I give it to the district office or directly to the principal?
3. If by some chance I get an interview, how do I explain why I’m leaving my current school?

Aside from the hybrid teaching, and general covid stuff, this woman has been a NIGHTMARE this year. We started the year with her having a sort of mental breakdown of sorts over a breakup. Now let me fill you in, this woman is my mother’s age, mid 60s. I had really looked up to her as  a mentor and professional last year, so I gave her some grace. But every day or the first two months of school my team members and I were subjected to wailing, crying, screaming, and tantrums when we weren’t teaching virtually. It got to the point where we all stopped coming and taught from home to avoid the drama and hysterics. We even all confronted her and said we were worried about her mental state. She was late to meetings or completely forgot about them, looked disheveled and was coming in wearing the same clothes multiple days in a row. It was shocking to watch and anxiety inducing to listen to her rant and cry on and on about this man she was only with for 6 months. Once that was over she turned her attention to the election and ranting about Qanon conspiracies she was reading about on Facebook. When we went back to F2F instruction I would hide in my classroom with the door locked and the lights off during planning so she wouldn’t come bother me. She noticed I was avoiding her and has now taken to questioning me about everything I am doing. What am I doing in my classes and what am I teaching? Trying to assert her dominance over me by quizzing me about all of my choices and instruction methods. Walking into my classroom while I’m teaching and listening in to my lessons outside the door. Quizzing my students outside in the hallway to make sure I am teaching them the standards. It’s not real harassment so I can’t go and complain. And I don’t want to be that whiny person who’s tattling to my boss but she’s making my job unbearable. I want to quit every day because I want to get away from her. I do t know what to do at this point. After having to stay home with my daughter today and getting a text from another team member that she was throwing a fit because I didn’t alert her and she’s the team lead, I sent a very passive aggressive email to my team about how I’m so sorry that while taking care of my sick child after not having slept all night and trying to pull together a sub plan I did not contact her directly. I’m just over it. And I don’t care what happens for sending that email. I’m just tired of her and her shit and almost wish I would get fired so I won’t have to deal with her anymore.

Here's the email they sent me:

""I am excited for your visit and interview on Friday, February 12th. We have you scheduled for 10:00-10:45 We love our elective roles at XXXXX, so this is a time to really demonstrate how engaging your class could be.

For example, Theater 1, Theater 2, and Poetry. This, however, could be 3 completely unrelated courses like Business, Yoga, and Intro to Engineering.

Please do not try to pitch ideas you think the students will like. Instead, pitch ideas that you are passionate about and can make come to life for our students. We want our students to have a great variety of choice with their electives and we want them to be taught well and with energy.

I attached a Course Catalog from the first XXXXXX. They did a great job of creating a robust course catalog. Please reference it as you are crafting your pitch.

If you have any questions or need to reach out in advance, my number is. Thank you again, and we can’t wait to see your presentation.""

Basically, I'm thinking of pitching them improv, theater - maybe a combo of both? Definitely debate since I still have all of my materials for that, and I'm kind of unsure about what else. Any ideas are welcome, but moreso any ideas about how I should pitch this or if anyone else has ever had an interview like this before and has any advice.

anaaki,2021-02-08 20:13:41+00:00,In desperate need of a lesson on getting along with others who have different beliefs/lifestyles than you,"We have some VERY STRONG personalities this year in our middle school group. I teach specials so I have a mix of kids from the ages of 11 (very young 6th graders) to 15 (9th grade). We are a very small group, even smaller this year due to families opting out for covid (didn't want to force their kids to wear masks).

As you can see from that last statement, I teach in a very conservative district. Not just conservative, but also very religious.

This year I had a couple students get very into LGBTQ+ rights, one came out as non-binary, the other as gay. I also have an third student who is openly trans.

To say this has caused a disruption to learning is an understatement.

I, along with the rest of my staff and admin, lean towards the more progressive and liberal side of things. We welcome out LGBTQ+ students and want to make sure they are not being harassed.

However, they've been VERY antagonistic and very forward about bringing attention to their lifestyles.

For example, they will out loud stop my class to make an announcement about what pronouns they use. I am fine with them asking peers during lunch or break to use their pronouns, but disrupting work time in class is not acceptable.

During class discussion, they will find ways to make things about being gay. Whether it's a clip art of two men on a worksheet, or just loudly conversing so the class can hear about their tastes, such as gay music or gay characters.

This gets the other students riled up. To the point where a debate on religion breaks out in class as the conservative kids break out the ""well God made you a GIRL therefore you are a GIRL."" Or the old classic, ""being gay is a sin.""

I am trying to keep peace. We've talked about respecting intellectual boundaries, we've discussed empathy, and respect.

Yet they just can't help but bring shit up that they know will get the other kids going. 

I've discussed it with their mom, who says she will not ask her kids to not be gay at school. When I tried to explain that is not the issue, the issue is they bring up sexuality in class and it causes arguments and disruption, she says it's their right to discuss whatever they want. For example, if they can't discuss boyfriends/girlfriends, then straight students shouldn't be able to either (the fact is, my cis-het students DON'T ever talk about this kind of stuff, because they are so sheltered). 

However, I also feel it is the rights of the other students to not have to constantly be barraged by the LGBTQ students. (In all fairness, I also shut down conversations of murder, weapons, drugs, etc. I also cut off any arguments on politics or mask wearing, as these turn into heated debates)

Mom wants us to use their pronouns more often, because as her child said, the other students are not using their new pronouns. I DO use the pronouns asked in front of other students, however, I don't know if legally I can force the other students to use them as well? Because doesn't that go against their beliefs?

I really feel that I am stuck between a rock and a hard place.

I just want everyone to get along, or agree to disagree, and show each other respect.

It's gotten to the point where the conservative families are pulling their kids out of our program because they don't want them learning about sexuality and gender at school.

I’m turning 29 soon and promised myself that if I didn’t get into a better district or closer to home by the time I was 30, I would leave teaching and seek something else that can better support my family financially and bring me some happiness (ideally).

As a teacher, there is a definitive narrow hiring season of only a few months. Many non-teaching careers require that you move around geographically from time to time to advance. The larger part of the professional world does not observe the restrictive hiring cycle that teachers must follow and living that way (especially in geographically spread out areas) means stifling your own (non-teacher) career.

Join us this Friday at Sunset (in solidarity) and take a 24 hour break from the hustle and bustle of technology. You deserve it. With love - from OfflineDay","Dear r/teaching

It's really hard to draw tech boundaries.Now with the pandemic, we are communicating that extra amount online for work, with family and friends and even relaxing online looking at screens. I'm sure that nobody is a stranger anymore to understanding some of the impacts it can have on mind and body.

I found that taking a 24 hour break, once a month, from Friday evening until Saturday evening (yes, just like shabbat)  makes a big enough difference, yet doesn't  interfere with my professional life all too much. It definitely made me feel refreshed, energised and I always ended up doing things that felt more meaningful, like learning an instrument, reading books that I never got to reading, spending time with loved ones, or being in nature.

The other thing is that I noticed it effected other aspects of my relationship with habits to the screen in the long run, in that I stopped looking at my phone before going to bed, was more conscious of the phone and how it was impacting my daily life etc. Taking that break heightened my sensitivity to knowing the difference it makes. It really makes a difference.

So, here I am, offering some of my time online to raise awareness that it can really make a difference to take a break like this. I started r/OfflineDay as a place for resources in sharing info about best practices or so that we an answer any questions you have if you'd like to try.

This Friday at Sunset, 24 hours- around the world. Enjoy!"
Spirited-Lychee,2021-02-02 09:44:16+00:00,In my senior year practicum and I just don’t feel passionate about this. I’m not enjoying this and I just need advice,"Hi, I have always wanted to be a teacher. I used to be so passionate about teaching, having my own classroom, empowering students, etc. but when junior year of college started I lost all interest. I considered changing my major but it was too late so I stuck with it. My family advised me to stick with it and finish. So I did that. I graduate in May, but I am not particularly enjoying my practicum. I am an elementary education major. I know being virtual is not ideal but I felt this way even before we went virtual. Teaching kids is very hard work. It takes patience and a special person and sometimes I feel that I am not that. The work does not seem intellectually stimulating sometimes. I just feel like such a fake, like someone better than me could do this job. As of right now I am hoping that I will somehow regain my love for teaching and will end up loving it. 

I am not enjoying my coursework. Instead of doing the work, I research other career options. I know it sounds really bad. I avoid waking up for my placements sometimes because I’d rather be sleeping. I clearly do have mental health problems that I need to sort out. It’s been hard to get out of bed. I get jealous of my classmates that are clearly so passionate about being teachers. I wish I could be like them. 

I have been searching for other career paths but I don’t know what fits me. I’ve looked into nursing, social work, counseling, even computer science. I just feel like I’m not that great with people. Nothing seems right. 

Sorry to be depressing. I like the idea of creating interesting lessons and things and I do enjoy my courses sometimes when we talk about how to teach and the activities. But the thought of doing this job in the future isn’t bringing me much joy. Kids deserve teachers who feel ecstatic about their jobs."

In terms of teaching in my career, I have disagreed with parents.

Other staff.

Other teachers.

Admin.

And yet, we have always come to an amicable conclusion that satisfies both parties.

But this year, there was a new challenger. One of my students has been coming to school lately with his homework less than half filled out. When asked why this was, he told me that it was because his home tutor teaches him and his 2 siblings at once. The home tutor doesn't let anyone see their in-class book to check for answers.

what?

The student explained that the tutor at home does the homework and reviews with the student, but expects the student to memorise and remember the work from class that we have done. So after one class, the student is expected to fully remember the work.

The tutor claims that it would be ""cheating"" to look back at the class book to find the answers.

I told the student that it is fine in my class to use the in-class book. I also wrote a note to the tutor explaining that the in-class book is crucial for their learning.

The tutor has not yet responded and my student is still coming with his homework half completed.

Am I in the wrong here? Information literacy and the ability to look up information is crucial and is an excellent 21st century skill. For context, I teach ESL/EAL."

wanderer_0z4,2021-02-01 12:55:53+00:00,Teaching someone a language without being able to speak their native language,"This might seem more like a rant, but I really need an advice. 

 I've been teaching English (online) for around 6 months. My students are Japanese, but I can speak Japanese so I was able to explain things without any issues. A week ago, however, my boss asked me to teach both English and Japanese to one Chinese student. He can't understand English at all and is able to speak Japanese just a little bit (he can read katakana and hiragana, and knows some common phrases but we can't communicate). Personally, I don't think it's a good idea to start two different languages from the scratch at the same time (he will have two classes a week, one English and one Japanese class), but they both believe it won't be a problem.

So far, I had only one English class with him last Friday. For the beginning, I tried teaching him how to introduce himself, taught him some useful phrases that he should use during classes (""Please repeat"", ""Please speak slowly"" etc) and practiced pronouncing some words with him. It was really more like a class to get to know him and estimate his language skills. 

He, however, kept asking a lot of questions during the class using google translate. Sometimes the machine translation was such that I wasn't able to easily understand what he meant. And sometimes he would stop me to ask something that I was just about to explain. When I tried to move on with my explanation and showed pictures and repeated it so he could easily understand even if I said it in English, he wouldn't really listen and instead repeatedly showed his translated question. Just random example to explain it; if I explained him what ""a man"" means, he would stop me and type in translator ""how do you say a woman?"" and when I said ""a woman"", he would still point to google translate on his phone for me to type it too. Sometimes I would just send him a picture and type ""woman"" in our chat, and he would then understand that I'm answering his question. Other times he wouldn't budge. Not to mention that I was feeling a little bit troubled for being stopped because if I've just told him how to pronounce ""a man"", it's only natural (is it not?) that I'll teach him how to say ""a woman"" next. He also stopped to ask me if ""a man"" can mean ""two or more people"", and I've explained that it's only singular, but also added that I will explain plural and singular nouns during some of our next classes. If Chinese is any similar to Japanese, then it lacks plurals in the normal English sense and it really deserves its separate class for him to learn how to properly use it. He would still, however, stop me and ask further questions regarding some other grammar, and in order to answer it, I had to use English to Chinese translator as well (he can't understand me at all when I speak English). 

I do usually appreciate when students show interest and ask a lot of questions, but it's really difficult to just skip to explain to someone how to say ""I am taller than you"", when they still don't even understand what ""I am a student"" means or even how to use a verb to be. It was all around the place and I think it was difficult for the both of us. I also don't think I could teach him anything if we need to keep using google translator, which he insists on. I did prepare a class that I thought was easy to understand for a beginner, and I used a lot of photos and was mimicking gestures. 

From what I could see, his English skills are really low. The most of the students I've taught knew to say some stuff, like ""a man"", ""a woman"", ""a table"", but it seemed he heard these for the first time. I planned to start with the verb to be on our next class, but my boss told me (he can speak Chinese) that this student requested lessons for more advanced English after our first one.

I am obviously failing at this badly, and I'm not sure about how to approach it. If he requested more advanced lessons, than maybe he understood more than I thought he did. It is easier to estimate how much the student knows and to explain things when I am able to speak their native language. I am also very against communicating via google translator during the class. The translations aren't accurate, it takes too much time to type and communicate that way, and I really tried to make the class as simple as possible for him to be able to understand, but I might have not done it so well.  

Can you please give me some advice? I've got a Japanese lesson with him tomorrow, and I've prepared the material, but I am worried it'll go as badly as the English class. How should I teach someone a language properly without being able to speak their native language and especially without using google translator?"

I also understand that in the pandemic more students are doing less work which means my amount of time spent grading is much lower than it will normally be. Due to my situation, I wouldn't read to much into the fact that I manage to leave work on time every day without working in the evenings or on weekends. Thing is, my wife who is an elementary teacher with 5 preps has worked the same rate the last 5 years. I also have colleagues with a fuller work load that manage to keep their hours ~40 per week.

This is such a huge contrast to the types of discussions I see teachers having online I routinely see teachers complaining about 60 plus hour weeks, teachers saying that they work in the summer (what, why???). So what gives? Why do some teachers have these miserable long work weeks, while others manage to get the job done as a regular 9-5? 

Is it that some teachers are better working smarter than harder?

Is it the different expectations of teachers by state?

is it just teachers getting tired of people constantly saying things like ""oh you're so lucky  you get so much time off, you hardly even have to work throughout the year"". They want to be appreciated so they exaggerate how much time they work each year?

I'm genuinely just trying to figure out why there seems to be such an insane variance on how much teachers across the country are working."
cactusglasses,2021-01-31 03:44:08+00:00,"(Pre-service teacher) How would you structure an English lesson for Year 3s? What would a typical lesson look like? (how much time on one task, what kind of tasks, etc.)","Hi, 

I’m a pre-service teacher.  I’m writing a unit plan for 16 English lessons as one of my assignments.

I’m getting stuck because I’ve never worked in a mainstream Year 3 classroom.  I don’t know kids’ attention spans and the kinds of activities that would be best suited to them.

I’ve got some cool, (hopefully) age-appropriate texts and videos I can use to explain the concept.  I’ve downloaded some sample unit plans and lesson plans to give me guidance.  I’ve got access to a bunch of textbooks to help with the theory side of things.  I’ve got some example work samples from the Department of Education’s website so I can see what standard of work to expect from a typically developing 8-year-old.  

Still, it’s very hard to visualise exactly what a lesson might look like when I haven’t yet entered a mainstream classroom.  I’d love some more concrete guidance on how to approach actual lesson structure.  Would 20 minutes of class discussion and then 30 minutes of group-work be appropriate?  How much independent writing do year 3s do?  These kinds of things are sticking points for me.  

I know these questions are very basic, but any more concrete advice at all on what a typical Year 3 English lesson might look like would be such a huge help.  

Thanks in advance.  :)"

Ohwhatabeautifulview,2021-01-30 18:45:28+00:00,Experiences with difficult admin?,"Hey all,

First-time post for me here. I've always had really positive relationships with my principals in my career. Sure, there have been many duds along the way but none of them ever had a personal problem with me and generally knew I was good at my job and trusted me. I am super passionate about teaching and do a lot of PD, re-invent my program constantly and take a strong passion for equity and a variety of global issues that weave their way into my program. 

Enough about me though, what I want to talk about is difficult administrators. Have any of you had an experience with an admin where they made assumptions about you and/or picked on you constantly? We recently got a new principal and this person seems to have come into our school ""guns a blazing"" so to speak, peeing all over everything in sight (metaphorically) to assert their dominance over staff. Every time an issue is brought up, they are quick to turn it onto me and ask me what I've done, why I haven't done enough, etc. when I feel personally that I only speak up when I am at the end of my rope and cannot manage with whatever the situation is. I feel in these situations I've done enough to support that student. I've also heard through the grapevine that this admin has made very unfair assumptions about me as a person when they literally do not know me, have never even watched me teach. It almost feels like this person is threatened and any time they feel like anyone knows MORE than they do about a situation (which we all know more than this person does right now about our students, as they just started at our school), they turn it around and claim that the teacher is stupid, unqualified to be speaking. 

I'm super concerned about how to move forward with this person. I don't want to have a bad relationship or years of battling with them ahead but I also won't tolerate being belittled. I don't know how to get through years with a boss that straight up doesn't like me for no reason? I'm used to having good relationships with my admin. If you've had experience with this before, are there any strategies or things you did to get through it? 

&amp;#x200B;

TY in advance!"
Healingbyhikin,2021-01-30 18:30:15+00:00,Teaching in urban areas and white savior complex,"Hello fellow educators , this post will be about some social and political issues and if you are uncomfortable with conversations about race keep scrolling. If you are offended by what I say I am so sorry and please send me a private message so we can hash it out. I am only writing from my own experience and limited knowledge! 

I’ve been really struggling with feeling like a “white savior” lately. My current position is working with Baltimore’s vulnerable youth and the majority of our students are black. I struggle because as a staff there is only about 20% people of color, and maybe 2% of us are from Baltimore if any? I want to help these students so bad, I love them, I believe in them. But sometimes I feel so out of my element, which is often good but also who am I as a white woman to tell these kids how to act. I don’t know what a day in their community looks like. I don’t what it feels like to grow up poor and black in Baltimore. I’m trying to educate myself, read books, but I still can’t shake the feeling that this program would be more beneficial coming from the students community members. We’re funded by John Hopkins university and I wonder why John Hopkins Is funding An outdoor school in Northeast  and not schools and organizations in Baltimore city run by people from Baltimore. 

In my elementary school I remember taking a reading level test on the computer and I had a 12th grade reading level in like 5th grade. Many of current students read at a second grade level or lower. I sat with an extremely intelligent student who still struggled with reading words like cake and cause. She did really well when I patiently sat with her and it was soon apparent she was dyslexic. Are you getting help for this in school I asked? “Well they just put me in a special ed class” another student I was helping (6th grade) was struggling with fractions and when I drew out a number line for her it seemed as though she had never seen fractions before or never had someone make her accountable for really looking at them. I am blown away by how much Baltimore schools are struggling. How high the turn over rate is in teachers, how much the students seem to be just passed along, the lack of support these students have the lack of support these teachers have. I am reminded of my privilege on a daily basis. 

I recently interviewed for teach for America and the last question was how will you contribute to ending racial inequality in schools across America. Wow. How will I as a single white woman end racial inequality in schools when our societies are so deeply flawed. I struggled with this question. I spoke in circles for awhile mostly talking about how I would provide an equal education for all of my students in my classroom. how I would meet them where they’re at, not let them fall behind, make sure they believed in themselves. I would make damned sure these kids knew how to read and I would be asking everyday to make sure their hierarchy or needs were being met. That they felt safe that they weren’t hungry. Later I wonder if should have said I would learn from the educators of color around me. That I would ask them how to best use my privilege to help these students. To ask them what they need from me. I need more resources more training more of a look into the communities that my students grow up in. Or maybe that I would advocate for my students of color to later become teachers to represent their communities. 79% of teachers in this country are white that’s a big problem. A huge problem. 

I don’t want to be a savior but I want love and support my students who need it most to the best of my ability. I am learning. I would love any insight."

I love the energy of the kids, being able to connect with them and see their faces (even with the masks!) and just feel the joy that they get from being able to engage with each other and our material is just - ahhhhhhh! It’s so good! They’re smiling and laughing and just being kids. I can’t wait for life to return to some sort of regular.

&amp;#x200B;

New teacher here, first year, \*\*zero experience\*\* (I wasn't an education major or minor, so no student teacher experience) - ELA/11th &amp; 12th. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year is immensely crazy but I've managed to bond with my kids and I've gotten a lot of feedback when it comes from them saying how they enjoy my class, like that I check up on them, etc. However, I feel that when it comes to my actual lessons...I'm a bit of a mess. I wasn't given a mentor (I'm an interim teacher, so we don't get a mentor teacher in my district), and I've been winging it. But...differentiated instruction, scaffolding, chunking...I know these are basic things but I've only taken  one education course as an elective. I simply just go through the novels/plays, kahoot, quiz/exam, and even go over things I feel juniors &amp; seniors should be prepared for when it comes to the ""real world"" (once every two weeks I have a special ""college &amp; career prep"" unit where there's a new topic such as interviews, student loans, college/majors, resumes, e-mail, cover letters, etc.) along with the topic they're supposed to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone in my school says that I'm doing a kickass job but...I'm a bit concerned that I don't properly know how to set up a unit. While these kids like me and they're doing a great job, I'm concerned that I'm not teaching them correctly. I feel I could be doing more and I don't feel I'm being effective. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I'm an interim ELA high school teacher in his first year. They threw me to the wolves and while I'm kicking ass, deep down I feel I'm winging it and not doing these kids any favors. Thoughts?"
gerbering,2021-01-30 00:44:25+00:00,Stop being lazy!!!,"Uggghh. I gave a quiz this week. I teach Algebra at a high school that is hybrid for the time being.

Some students didn’t do their classwork until after the quiz because they realized eligibility check for athletics was this Friday. “Why did I do so bad on the quiz??” Well you didn’t learn the material, at all!

Others complain that they don’t know how to do the classwork and it’s too hard. These are the same students who skip class all the time.

We spent the whole class period today reviewing for a test next time. Five kids started yelling at me because we had a quiz this week!! This is school! What did you think we were gonna do?? Yes, we are going to have tests and quizzes! 

Kids complain that they didn’t know how to do the problems. I ask them where their notes are. “I don’t take notes.” Uh huh. 

I’m pretty sure most students are going to fail the test.   Nearly half failed the quiz, despite me providing instructional videos outside of class and going over the exact type of problems (read: just replaced the freaking numbers with other numbers) in class.

Someone please give me some kind of comfort or inclination that I’m not alone before I smash my head into the wall."
lukef31,2021-01-30 00:06:54+00:00,Advice needed,"For some background, I'm an elementary teacher with a class with several (about 5) class clowns.

Last year I sought advice on dealing with classroom management. I've found several ways since then to keep it under control. However, I have one student in particular (we'll call him student A) who is constantly disrupting class. He gets upset because of some sort of negative consequence, and he just loses it. He'll yell over me while teaching, leaves his desk to go mess with another kid, and calls out constantly.  He's gone to admin several times and even received in-school suspension. I have reason to believe, that I'm not going to elaborate on here, that home life isn't great.

Admin pulled him out the other day, and he says he's just trying to be funny like student B and student C, but no one ever laughs at his jokes. 

What is some advice you can give me for dealing with this student?"

I figure maybe I could use the time to help them learn in a fun way. Does anyone have any games I could play? I was using Jeopardy to reinforce vocab and literary elements, which is good, but it's become a bit repetitive for them and it takes a while to write out all the slides etc. The class is online so nothing tactile would work. And although I have a lot of flexibility, they do have to be learning-based. The students are in 7th grade (but on a 9th-grade level). Every time I look for games online I get elementary based games or Jeopardy, but there must be something else.  Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated."
Xoxo_Idjey,2021-01-29 21:51:35+00:00,Why did I become a teacher?,"I am a fifth grade teacher and it’s my first year with my own classroom. I am also the only fifth grade teacher. My mentor has never taught fifth grade and always tells me she is sorry she can’t help me. There are 2 other schools in my district, both with 4-5 fifth grade teachers in them but I have zero help with planning and materials. We have been hybrid since the beginning of the year, which is super challenging. I have 26 students total, with 10 in class everyday and 10 online. The other 6 just come to school when they want to, and go on zoom when they want to with zero notice or notifications. 

Annoyance 1: Yesterday my secretary(who is working from home), emailed me about my new student. She included that she hoped she wasn’t the first to tell me(she was), but she had zero info. She told me my principal would be in contact, I receive his information today at 4:30 PM. It’s Friday, he starts fucking Monday. He has a behavior plan, but I haven’t seen it. He has violent behaviors is all I was told. 

Annoyance 2: We had parent teacher conferences scheduled for one and a half days this week, so no students. The other elementary schools only had half a day for conferences and then were able to have second day off. We were then told on the half day that if we scheduled any conferences for after school hours throughout the week, we could have off Friday. Obviously since none of us knew this, we couldn’t have off. 

Annoyance 3: So, since the other schools had off I asked if we were allowed to work from home. We would be on zoom all day anyway, there was no need to be in building. I was told we were only allowed to do conferences at home if they were after school hours. Then, I received an email from my boss saying she would be working from home that day. 

Annoyance 4: we all worked our contracted day (8-3:30), and were told at 3:15 we could leave after working 6 hours! So, we could have left at 2:00. Fuck my district"

I have been providing orchestral lessons to kids for the past few years; however, due to COVID, I found there to be a huge disconnect between myself and the students, and it is something I am struggling with. I always try to make our lessons something to look forward to, not dread, and be as helpful as possible by suiting their personal learning styles. Now, I struggle to create fun activities to hook their interest and the kids seem unexcited for yet another day of playing a foreign instrument. I always try to put the kids’ needs before mine (of course); however, I can’t help but feel disheartened at the end of the day because I feel as though I am letting them down.

An example of this is how a student I work with is a visual learner, from what they have told me when I asked, so I have been filming videos of me playing through the music, creating worksheets/guides, and attaching helpful YouTube video links; however, the student does not seem invested in the instrument, and often does not practice. 

What are some ways you all got your students excited to learn remotely? If there are any music teachers on here, how have you been able to tackle the struggle of introducing an instrument to a youth without being able to guide them firsthand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

reed12321,2021-01-29 00:16:58+00:00,Today was a bad day,"I’m a special ed teacher, and a pretty heartbreaking thing that a mom said to me once was, “When my son comes home, and I see that he drew all over his pants, I ask him, ‘How was your day?’ and he always responds, ‘Today was a bad day.’” 

That student of mine was in 8th grade, had an autism and ADHD diagnosis, and thus had a pretty rough go of middle school. 

While I will never ever equate myself and my struggles to those with disabilities, I have a newfound understanding of what he meant when he said, “Today was a bad day.” 

Covid has finally taken grip and its toll on me emotionally and spiritually. At the beginning of quarantine, I was actually excited. I felt liberated knowing that performance was no longer being observed and that my primary job was to connect with  my kids. I made fun, interactive online videos for my middle school kids showing them how to bake some cookies while messing up the recipe, and building a planter box. I taught them what I thought was some valuable life lessons and was excited to know that I got to forge my own path and bring my students along for a little bit. 

Then school started up as hybrid in the fall, and everything still felt like it had a positive tint to it while masking the doom and gloom that hid behind unsuspecting masks. Responsibility after responsibility piled on top of each other. Scheduling IEP meetings so we can play catch-up for those we missed in the spring, creating temporary programming solutions for students and families who chose to keep their children home full time, crating temporary programming solutions for families that chose to allow their students to engage in the hybrid model, rearranging staff coverage every time someone had an exposure and needed to quarantine, rearranging long-term staff coverage every time someone that worked with my students tested positive, juggling hybrid classes where students were home and in school at the same time, writing new IEPs, scheduling zoom meetings for everything, grading assignments, adding progress marks on IEP goals/objectives, creating lesson plans, and attending staff meetings that were veiled as a positive “pep rally” while slyly adding more responsibilities. This is not sustainable. 

Today I realized I missed an important deadline. The deadline should have been today and this is the first time in my 7 years as a teacher that I missed something like this. I’m not even the only SPED teacher this month that has missed this. My district and my coworkers are not slackers, or negligent what so ever. The responsibilities that teachers are dealing with are infinitely more than a normal school year, which is still infinitely more than what we should have to deal with. As I said, this is not sustainable. I can’t handle having a near-panic attack on an almost daily basis thinking I missed submitting something that seems like a waste of my time. However, what I missed today was a big deal. 

I called my boss today and thankfully I was able to finagle this situation in a more favorable way, but this is still not a good look. I don’t feel good about this. I feel like a failure because I’m doing everything I can while juggling so many other things. I literally can’t do any more of the things that my district wants us to do. 

I feel like a failure. Today was a bad day. And what you can’t see is that my pants are now totally black with all of the pen I wish I could have drawn all over them."

daedricelf,2021-01-28 15:47:07+00:00,Thoughts on student teachers and pay?,"Hi everyone - I just wanted to share a (potentially unpopular) opinion and see what thoughts everyone else has on this. This is probably mostly rant, and for that I do apologize.

For context, I'm a student teacher right now working to get my license to teach HS. Myself and a few student teachers I know put in 40+ hours a week towards our internships (grading, planning, teaching, attending meetings, all that fun stuff). We are also told to avoid working as much as possible to focus on our internships.

I completely understand how having a job is just added stress - I moved my own work schedule to work 12 hr shifts on the weekends to free up my weekdays but also pay my bills, because I'm also an adult who lives on their own. However, I do feel that if we are going to be asked to not work, we should at least recieve a stipend of some sorts.

Do we deserve full pay? Absolutely not. I am not licensed and the teacher I'm under is still carrying me through this, working just as hard (especially during COVID). I recognize and understand that I'm not a ""real"" teacher yet, so getting full pay would be absolutely ridiculous. Again, though - I am teaching, planning, supporting my kids, attending the meetings, and doing all of the teacher things, for free. I'm appreciative of the opportunity and I adore teaching, but believe student teaching being a paid internship would be fair.

(I also recognize that there's no way in Hades that a state/school/district would ever support this, but I needed to rant to someone other than my poor husband)."

It will be at least a month before I start since the background check has to clear. Is there anything you would recommend bringing my first day on the job? Or things I might be interested at some point? 

Effective classroom management strategies? When I was subbing I used the “1, 2, 3” method with the younger children. Usually worked, but I think it was also partly because they would get a lap at recess. 

There will be 1-2 teacher aides with me, 20 kids. Though because of the pandemic theyre mainly virtual right now, but anything for going back to in person would be great as well!

Sorry if the post was all over, I’m still excited that they are moving forward with the process and trying to be prepared as much as I can!"

Our system is at first hour, kids unplug their devices and they tote them from class to class.  At the end of the day they return to their first hour and plug them back in.  They are not allowed to take them home.

&amp;#x200B;

Really appreciate whatever help can be offered and time is somewhat of the essence because I need to decide whether to follow a path I've been accepted to (don't want to talk shit on any programs that deigned to accept me so keeping it vague).

I live in Florida, just graduated from college with a BS in Psych and want to teach badly. I did an educational mentorship for over a year with a program for poor kids in trouble with the juvenile justice system to differing degrees usually multiple grade levels behind, got told to kick dust by TFA and now just super want to teach in one of these 4 states (or city) because I have family and/or friends in each of them and know I'll want at least some support. 

I've been applying to tons of things since being rejected by TFA: Master's programs in those states, CAS programs, etc. I'm just not sure which is the most ""legit""/""best use of my time and money path"". 

From people who actually live in and know what it's like in the topsy-turvy system, how should I best go about this? 

Also, I'm sure everything's crazy during COVID (I have been working in the restaurant industry since it began, it's cuckoo there), so advice or experience may not perfectly map onto the present, but any anecdotal paths or ways people wish they had done it would be beautiful. 

**TL;DR: I just really want to find out the most efficient time-wise and success-wise path to teaching in one of those general locations. Open to all teaching conditions.**"

capybaramelhor,2021-01-26 00:15:59+00:00,"A small, simple breakthrough with remote teaching","Like many of you here, here, I have been very frustrated this year. I have been remote the entire year and I teach middle school science. 

I have had many of the same struggles… Students not attending, not talking, no cameras, just a complete lack of connection. It has been very frustrating. 

I have started to do one thing recently that has seemed to help individual classes somewhat. Sometimes, when I start class with a small anecdote or a story about myself, it really increases participation and engagement throughout the class. 

For example, once a student mentioned that they were going to a surprise party for their sibling that weekend. I told them about a time (years ago) that I threw a surprise party for my husband and how his friend pretended to be locked out of the apartment. Another time I told them I stayed up way too late over the weekend and asked them to guess what I was doing (reading a book).

You can decide what kinds of stories you’re comfortable sharing! 

I know this is a really small thing, and many of you probably do it already. But I have found that it is a way to get the students to open up, laugh, participate, and has seemed to help and keep that vibe throughout most of the rest of the period. 

Let me know if you have any other small tips or wins that make remote learning better!"

With that, we’re also putting a ton of trust in parents and kids who a lot of times could not care less about us and our well being. 

Today, a student showed up with a doctor’s note after missing 3 of the last 4 days of school. Ok, no biggie. She said she had allergies. Fair enough. Until I started to did deeper. I asked this student if they had any other symptoms last week, and low and behold they had a fever, body aches, stomach issues, and a constant cough. She was still coughing frequently today. I asked her if she was tested for covid, and she said, very quickly, “no.”

That did not make me happy to hear in any sense so I called the school nurse and spoke with the principal as well. The local health department told us that she was in the clear because she had a doctor’s note from within the last five days, UNLESS she complains about not feeling well. So after hearing this, I mentioned to the student that I would like for her to let me know if she’s not feeling well at all today. Her response was “but my parents told me not to saying anything” and “they’ll be mad if I have to go home.”

Sure enough, an hour later she told me she was not feeling well (and it was legitimate, she looked miserable). 

The point is, there truly are people who don’t give a shit about teachers or their families. I have people that I go home to that I love very much. I don’t want them getting sick. I feel awful for the kid to have parents teaching her such shit morals.

We have a hybrid model learning at our school. All instructions and assignments are on Canvas and we’re required to have synchronous learning twice a week. Some students are learning from home and some are sitting in my classroom on their school issued chromebooks. I teach 7th grade English. 


So, all year I have had just a few students who don’t log in or complete much work. The students who regularly log in put a decent amount of effort into their assignments. But this semester, each English teacher were forced to take in new kids because another English teacher left and her class was dissolved. I feel as though this is what sparked a lot of the issues I currently have in class. On top of that, admin randomly decided students were required to have Google folders shared with their english teachers which compiled all of their writing assignments. So in essence, they have to go back and forth between google drive and Canvas to do work. 😐


Last Thursday, I assigned them an essay. We’ve done 5+ essays in my class over the last semester, and they did decently. This time, I only gave them 1 day to plan and 1 day to write their rough draft in prep for an upcoming benchmark. Only 1/4 of my students actually submitted the rough draft. Another 1/4 told me they’re still struggling with the rough draft (this is not day 3 of the essay), and the rest of the students have not even began it. On top of that, only half my students created and shared a Google folder with me, and only a few of those students are actually putting their writing in that folder. AND the at-home students have been impossible to reach, as they refuse to answer my Teams calls. With the in-person learners, some refuse to do their work as well and calling home to parents after several warnings has not been effective. 


Of the few drafts that I have been able to ready, I am appalled at their writing, especially the new students. I cannot understand how a student has made it to 7th grade without being able to write a complete simple sentence.  These students aren’t even ESL or LEP. They are actually incapable of forming a thought in a complete sentence and putting that down on paper or a google document. They don’t know what paragraphs are......


I have no idea what to do. I am a first year teacher. I feel so stressed that none of the kids are doing their work and worried about the new generation... I am especially frustrated with the students who are not new to my class and who have done well before but now are suddenly saying they don’t know how to write an essay. 😭"

gauchelygraceful,2021-01-24 17:24:10+00:00,Advice for teaching young children who have difficulties concentrating,"Hey all! I am currently tutoring a 4-year-old girl in my building and helping her learn to read and write. She's a very sweet kid and has lots of energy and imagination (she loves telling stories and drawing). However, I have difficulty making her concentrate on one task at once, especially when it involves reading or writing. Sometimes, I'm able to get her excited about learning, but after a few minutes, she quickly gets bored and wants to do something else. I've tried to orient lessons towards her preferences (e.g. writing letters/words on cards and hiding them around the house in a treasure hunt style, writing words down and having her read and then draw the word), and I try to kind of go with the flow so she doesn't feel like I'm forcing her to sit down and study for an hour straight, because that seems unrealistic for a 4-year-old (i.e. if she says she's bored of an activity, I ask her what I can do to make it less boring, or if she says she wants a break to play hide-and-seek, I play with her before turning back to reading/writing). While these strategies sometimes works for a short while, it's hard to get her to focus on reading/writing in the long run. I am also afraid that by making my lessons so play-oriented, I'm kind of indulging her lack of concentration.

I'm going to be an elementary school teacher next school year, so I consider this practice in taking students' needs and interests into account when helping them learn. While I love spending time with her and I feel like she *is* learning to read and write new words to a certain extent, I also feel somewhat discouraged at the fact that I'm unable to get her interested in reading/writing for a prolonged period of time.

Does anyone have any advice on how to get her more interested in reading/writing, or on how to manage children in general who quickly get bored of tasks/lessons? What can I do to help her become more engaged while not encouraging her to view reading/writing as a chore?

Thank you so much!"
slk_thor9,2021-01-24 16:55:11+00:00,Teacher prep programs - useful?,"**TL;DR Is it common to hate teacher prep programs and feel like it isn't actually preparing you for real-life teaching?**

I'm currently enrolled in a Master of Arts in teaching program. I have never felt less engaged or unstimulated while learning than I do now. I already have a graduate degree and two undergrad degrees, so it's not that I hate school or don't enjoy learning. **Is this common?**

Granted, it may be because I'm in a fully online program (WGU). BUT, I've taken numerous other online courses and I felt engaged and eager to learn, so I don't think it's the solitary aspect.

I find it ironic that we're learning about different learning theories, teaching strategies, and assessment methods, but we're taught via **one** strategy (basically a shit ton of reading supplemented by a few YouTube videos) and assessed via **one** method (papers or summative exams at the end of the course). So basically we're expected to memorize and regurgitate, which I think we can all agree is about as boring and meaningless as it gets.

I thought this program would be a good fit for me because I work full time, it's affordable, and got good reviews when I researched it. However, I'm starting to think that maybe 1) this program just isn't for me, 2) maybe teaching isn't for me, or 3) I just have pursued an alternative path to licensing.

The teacher I am replacing left without any notice due to a family emergency. The school gave me 2 days of training that really only covered stuff about the general school rules, benefits, stuff like that. 

They threw me into the classroom without any lesson plans whatsoever. They couldn’t even tell me where the students left off. I had to go through each topic and standard with my classes to see what they remembered learning. 

The school said they don’t have any lesson plans literally at all for my class because the teacher had her chalk account removed, which is where her lesson plans were. I am also the only science teacher for this grade. There’s no grade above me and the science teacher in the grade below me quit as well. All I have pretty much is a list of standards. 

I have friends who started teaching midway through the year and they all have partner teachers that give them lessons plans and help.  My coworkers are super nice and helpful, but they can only do so much on top of their own work, especially when they’ve never taught science and don’t have any plans either.

Obviously not all at the same time but within a couple of weeks. One possession and one public intox were dismissed/deferred disposition. So I have two guilty misdemeanors now. Like I said that was all two and a half years ago and I've grown up a ton since then. I am 23 now. By the time I finish my degree and actually start applying for jobs the charges will be about 4 years old. How will this affect me seeking employment in teaching? Thank you in advance!!!

GallhadtheGreat123,2021-01-22 19:37:39+00:00,Advice?,"I recently considered becoming a high school history teacher for my career. It had been something in the back of my mind for years, and I'm 90% sure it is what I want to do now. However, I've heard it is very difficult to get a job as such. My plans are very loose and subject to change, but just wanted to ask about things I should keep in mind going forward.

Now me personally, I am coming from a well-off background so money isn't really an issue for me. I've also very strongly thought about teaching in inner-city public schools.

So I wanted to ask veteran teachers, what would help me land a job? I assume a willingness to teach at multiple grades, schools, and subjects would help. Would experience teaching in less competitive positions for a while help if I wanted to land a more specific position that I'd prefer to teach later on? Are positions easier to find at public schools in the inner-city?

Also considering a special ed job as well, and wondering if that is also in high demand and if there is any advice that teachers have in preparing myself for it (what classes I should take to educate myself, what to expect, etc.).

(I feel like this comes off as cynical and very ""white savior""-like, but I'm basically just asking as someone who wants to be a public servant and how I could both serve communities in the ways most needed, while also feeling satisfied personally.)"

I don’t even have a classroom and have to teach in the cafeteria, meanwhile still prepping the kids for the state test teaching hybrid during covid.

anyway, the only reason I’m still at this school is because I’ve applied for dozens of other teaching jobs in my area in every district around me and have had no luck getting a new job. I’ve had a couple of interviews, each with hundreds of applicants. I’m beginning to feel hopeless, and have no idea how I’m supposed to stand out in that large of an applicant pool with so few positions opening up.

is there anything I can do to make myself more marketable (I already have my reading endorsement and a PK-3 license)? I’ve been teaching for 3 years, 2 of those in kindergarten, and I was a daycare teacher for 1.5 years before that. What specific positions are school districts looking to hire most? At this point I’m considering going back to school to do special ed, TESOL, or counseling. Do I just need more experience? Help! Thank you!"

Dobbys_Other_Sock,2021-01-22 00:42:20+00:00,Why do I even bother talking?,"Today I hit a mental wall. I teach high school ELA for Freshman and Seniors. My freshman seem to believe that doing work is optional? It’s been a problem the whole year but the last few weeks it’s gotten significantly worse. 

Today was a practice day for the writing section of their end of the year testing. We’ve done it a few other times during the year and they’ve all taken the actual test several times so it’s nothing new to them. Three sources and a prompt question, write an essay. I talk them through the prompt, what it’s asking, and what they need to include. I give them 10 minutes then start circling the room. I approach students they seem to be doing nothing (usually on their phones) to get them focused on the work. 

Student: “we’re supposed to be doing something?” 

Me: “Yes (explains whole assignment again and help them find it on classroom) start working and I’ll come back to check on you” Have this conversation about 15 more times. 

I look around a see at least 3 kids don’t even have computers open any more. I approach those students.

Student: I’m gonna work on it later at home. 

Me: “this needs to be done during class today so you need to work on it now.” 

Repeat 4 times, 7 students are now not working, two of them are playing games, 4 on their phones. I got to those students ask them to put their phones away and work, they don’t even acknowledge that I said anything. 

We get to the last 10 minutes of class, students pack up and stand by the door, I talk, demand, beg, yell, and harass them to sit back down, they ignore me and continue on. 

If it was one class I would understand and I’ve talked to other teachers and they are experiencing the same issue right now as well. It’s just so disheartening to stand in a room and talk to myself. 

To;dr: my students don’t do anything and don’t care that I’m even in the room."

Leomonade_For_Bears,2021-01-21 22:18:25+00:00,Other teachers not following policies making us all look bad.,"I know this is not exclusively during covid,  but it has certainly highlighted the worst of it. A large portion of our switch back to in person was due to outcry that ""the teachers are on vacation "" which isn't true.  Except for the teachers that went to their family cabins, wear hoodies/lounge clothes during zooms, have a TV playing in the background, and even one who zoomed their classes while ice fishing. Some teachers (although not publicly) even talk about how they picked up day drinking and would just have a beer sitting off camera while working.       
       
Now due to public outcry we're in person again.  Those same teachers that gave us a bad rep during online learning are continuing it.  Not enforcing social distancing, masks, etc.  Not reading mandatory protocol for their first hour classes, and not playing the daily announcements which there is time built in to the schedule for.  These are the same teachers who make me look like a villain for enforcing our regular school policies, like cell phones.

I couldn't hate it more.

I thought being at home would be a dream - plenty of time, no distractions, coffee when I want, and toilet trips when you need them (not an hour later). I couldn't have been more wrong and I miss my class.

Which other job are people gutted they missed a Zoom call?

Which other jobs will someone purely do work because they've seen your face?

Where else does someone get excited to complete work because they know it will make you happy?

Where else do you hear at work someone's happy purely because you're there?

Don't get me wrong the job can be hard but seeing my most challenging child get up early, purely to do a call with me so he could do some writing (which he hates) really reset my view on teaching.

I hope this helps you to just reflect on some of those positives that make you smile. Who's that kid that just says something nice to you for no reason? Who thanks you for spending that little extra time with them? Who's just happy because you're their one solid element in an otherwise crazy world?

So I’ve been meaning to write this post for awhile, I just didn’t really know how to put all of this out there. 

I’m in my first few years of teaching (sorry for being vague) and I absolutely LOVE the students at my school and admin... however I’m not a fan of the district as a whole sometimes and my immediate team members drive me up a wall. 

We don’t have much in the way of curriculum, and so it has been up to us to “figure it out” which has somehow been twisted to me being the only one figuring it out. I work with veteran teachers who have been at the same school for many years who for some reason can’t be bothered to make a lesson.

If they do make anything, they don’t share it. 
If I make something and don’t share it, I get shamed in a super passive aggressive way. 

One teacher in particular that I work with, takes personal offense if I do not greet them every morning and spend time during plan in their classroom... even when I have things to grade and lessons to plan... to the point of them often coming in my room and saying things like, “it’s just so nice when people come and say hi to me in the morning.” They also have had tantrums during planning time and have wasted an entire plan. 

When admin found out about this, I was supported in the decisions for lessons that I was making, but also was told to start being a leader... which has resulted in me sharing more of my stuff than before while still getting nothing in return.

I am able to get along with my coworkers in my department on a super surface level, but it just feels super toxic. 

I really like working with the kids, and admin is usually very supportive so I just don’t know what to do... and will it actually be better at a different school?"

BananaBean7,2021-01-20 04:24:32+00:00,How to know whether to switch schools/positions as a first year teacher?,"I'm wondering about how you knew whether to stay in your current position or try to pursue a new one, and what the process is like. For reference, I teach 11/12th English as part of an integrated ""lab"" (classroom) at a technical high school, with two co-teachers who teach science. It's my first year teaching and we've been fully online this year.

I don't have much to compare it to, but I know that in some ways I'm very lucky -- our admin is very supportive, I work with two veteran teachers who know a lot, it's a hands-on program that offers the kids a lot of opportunities. The school culture is great and my co-teachers and I get to design our own curriculum.

Unfortunately, there are some fundamental elements of the position that make it feel like not a great fit for me. I'm not very interested in teaching English through the context of science, which has effected my motivation to design curriculum (which I would normally love). While I'm grateful that I wasn't alone for this year and I have learned a lot from my co-teachers, I'm a very independent person/teacher and I don't like always having to run things by them or work together to build curriculum. We have different perspectives on some things that I think are really important (discussing current events, culturally sustaining pedagogy, etc). Also, one of my co-teachers is very toxic in the way she talks about coworkers and students, and her negative attitude has started to influence the way I view our kids and their potential.

How did you know whether your position was right for you? Am I being too selective? Is it normal to prefer not to work in such a collaborative setting, or am I just not being a good sport?

Most importantly, when would I need to start looking for other positions? What is the process like for changing to a different school within the same district? How do I let my boss know I'm looking for other positions? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I am currently employed as a teachers assistant in a public elementary school. I am in a REACH program Special Education classroom. At the same time, I am currently attending Hofstra University to get my masters in Elementary Special Education in inclusive settings, as well as general education. 

Talking to a lot of teachers at my school have gotten me very stressed out and anxious. They keep telling me how hard it is to get a teaching job (your own classroom). I graduate in a year, student teach the upcoming fall semester. I graduate in the middle of next year, so it may be hard to get a job.. which I’m worried about. 

My question is: is getting a full time teachers job at a public school terribly hard? I know I have a year to go but I am very stressed and it’s currently keeping me up a night.

I busted my ass for 6 months to get good at doing assignments on Canvas. I’ve been carrying our long term sub through the ridiculous learning process that is Canvas ( no, my district didn’t offer any training! Just watch a video, duh). I was just finishing my assignments on Canvas for the week YESTERDAY. Nothing seemed amiss, no notification or announcement or email from Canvas telling me they were going to rock my world with a crazy-ass update.
Today, everything looks the same until you go to edit a page or assignment. The rich content editor is COMPLETELY FUCKING DIFFERENT. It’s so different that I had to just give a link for an assignment. I feel like I have to learn Canvas all over again IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR. 
Of course, I got ahold of the Canvas help desk and they can’t do anything but give me a link to retrain myself on using their rich content editor. I don’t know who the asshole or assholes at Canvas are that made this call, but I’d just like to thank that person or people for making an already hard and shitty year worse. Maybe this new content editor is somehow magically easier and I’m just so fucking stunned that such a major change would be made in the middle of the year that I can’t see the value of this change just yet.

But to say I've spent the past year and a half with Impostor Syndrome would be an understatement.  I am surrounded by experts, and I constantly worry about what I'm teaching when or how I'm teaching it.  Or that I'm not doing enough.

I've heard that you don't really ""teach"" until your third or fourth year; you're just surviving and learning until then.  Is that true?"
ediblethrowaway1991,2021-01-20 00:43:57+00:00,Feeling called out as the only white male teacher during my our school's leadership and equity meeting,"Hey /r/teaching, I would really appreciate someone to provide some perspective for me here.

For context, I'm a second year elementary school teacher at a pretty nice school in Berkeley CA. Most families are fairly affluent and about 30-40% of our students are minorities. I'm the only male teacher at this site. 

I signed up for the Leadership Committee and the Tech Team this year because I knew that I would have a lot more time with distance learning and I wanted to get my feet wet in leadership positions. We have been meeting twice a month with an anti-racist coach (hired from outside of our district) to talk about anti-racism, white supremacy, and equity policy. 

I consider myself pretty far on the left, maybe would classify myself as a democratic socialist if that matters. I'm open to new ideas and certainly open to learning about habits or tendencies that I'm doing or notice that are systemically oppressive in one way or another. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I'm definitely trying to put my best foot forward.

The issue is, I felt like I was being singled out and attacked by the anti-racist coach during today's meeting. We were all asked to reflect on questions related to white normalcy within and outside of the classroom that we notice or perpetuate, as well as potential policies that we could consider to combat these issues. All great stuff, truly! The 8 other teachers in the meeting had really eye opening stories to share that really enlightened me to some of the things that were happening behind the scenes. One black teacher shared how parents would follow up with her after a meeting to bullet point ""these are thing that you said you would do"" but completely code switch when they were in a shared meeting with the teacher and the principle, acting much less threatening. Other issues of white parents leaving multiple paragraph emails to try and make the class work around their child, teachers noticing that black students are unfairly punished for small rule breaking, and the like. 

Every teacher had shared something but I was taking it all in. I was learning a lot from the perspectives of these teachers, and I was really surprised to hear how different their experience was to mine. It was never the norm that everyone had to share, and I didn't really feel like I had anything else to contribute after the rest of the teachers had. Still, the coach stopped another teacher mid sentence to have me chime in on what I was thinking (I at first thought this was a kind gesture from her to allow me to speak in case I was feeling shy or something). I let her and the group know that I didn't have much to add, seeing as I'm only a 2nd year teacher, both of my teaching years have been abnormal due to 1st year teaching and covid this year, and that I just really appreciated getting the insights from everyone that had shared and that I needed to think about how these questions applied to me. I also admitted that I realized that I probably didn't share these experiences because I was a new, white male teacher. 

Even after this, the coach (in my eyes) started to attack what I was saying and asked me to ""really dig deep to find your white racism"" as if what I was saying earlier was an attempt at deflection. I was honestly a little taken aback, and asked her what she was trying to get at. She said ""I know if you think hard enough there are a lot of things that you are probably doing as a white male teacher that are upholding white normalcy, and I think you should reflect on that"". I kinda nodded and put myself on mute. 

There was a long silence, and then I realized she wanted me to do this type of ""soul searching"" right here, live! I just want to stress again, I'm the youngest, least experienced, only male teacher in this group and I thought I had very politely answered just as adequately as any other teacher in the call. I felt a little emarassed and said ""Ohh, you want me to do that now? Like I said, I don't think this is something that I can just ""admit to"" without thinking about first. As for noticing these patterns at school, as a 1st year teacher I was only thinking about getting through the next day. This year, we are all isolated in our own Zoom bubbles, so of course I'm not going to notice these practices unless they are shared from other teachers like in this meeting - which is why I joined. I will definitely reflect more on the prompts, which is what I said I wanted to do when you first asked for my input"". 

I hoped that was the end of it, but she kind of turned to address the group and said ""See, we all need to learn to be vulnerable and honest about how we are all contributing to this. It started with admitting there is a problem. This kind of work takes time"". It felt like I was being singled out and put on trial! She didn't do this to ANY other teacher. 

I honestly am a little lost for words. I am not perfect by any stretch, but my intentions are genuine. I just can't comfortably sit here and be painted as some perpetrator of racism and white supremacy because what I shared was my truth wasn't good enough for her to hear. I feel like this woke attitude of everyone is the perpetrator of these actions regardless if you are doing everything you can to make a positive change is extremely disheartening and goes against the very purpose of this type of work. 

Well /r/teaching, what do you think? Is my white privilege showing from this post, or do I actually have a right to feel phased by this?"

I made a free website called Dashbrain that creates a better chat experience for Zoom in just a couple of clicks, with clearer raise-hand notifications, one-click polls, Q&amp;A features, custom group-chats (instead of just ""everyone""), and exporting the chat to a PDF. It works similarly to Kahoot, where you tell students a short 5-digit code, and then they can join the group. If you're interested in it, you can find it here: [school.dashbrain.us](https://school.dashbrain.us). It's entirely free, and has helped many hosts I know, so I hope you find it helpful as well.

This student was behind and needed to catch up, but I often catch them goofing off during class and work time. They’ll be in another meet with friends while also in class, editing google docs with friends, won’t open assignments during work time even with prompts. On Friday I point blank said “do this assignment, it’s the easiest to do and you’ll finish within 20 mins”. Nope. Fine, there’s other kids who need my help. 


 I was working from home so I had one laptop open in google meets with my classes, and another I used to watch their screens and answer questions through chat. I’m answering questions through chat and helping students through google docs, also talking to kids verbally so they knew I was still there (a true juggling act) when I hear an email notification. The parent of the student mentioned earlier accuses me of being on social media instead of teaching. They also say their student could really use my help getting caught up rather than sitting on my computer. 


I am.... still enraged. Responded respectfully explaining that while it may look like I’m slacking, I’m helping students work on another laptop. I mentioned their student declined to work that day.


Even when I know and have proof that I’m in the right, these parent emails are still so hurtful. Do we eventually get over this?"

I’m an MBA student and my Economics professor is using a hybrid-delivery teaching method where 50% of students will be attending class via Zoom and the other 50% in-person. This also goes for exams, which are closed-book, closed-note and taken real-time during class. There aren’t any deterrents to cheating other than the honor code. 

The exams are curved based on class averages and I’m deeply worried about the online students using their notes and computers on the exams and killing the curve for the in-person students (not to mention the honest virtual ones). Spoiler Alert: **this is what happens Every. Single. Time.** It’s made even worse because looking at the course roster, most of the poorly-performing students opted to be online while most of the strong students are in-person.

I really want to update him and tell him about how I'm doing in college, so I asked my brother who is in the same school as him to ask him for an email so I could email him. Is that weird?

That being said, I have a degree in history, and minor/concentration in sustainable food education and climate change management, so I haven’t studied the pedagogy and techniques for teaching. 


I teach/assist in lower elementary (1st-3rd grade) and, while my co-teachers are wonderful, they are overworked and have a lot to do all the time. We also don’t have an in school counselor (long story - this has been a rough year, as you all know) and because of that, we don’t have any help with the neuroatypical students we have.

LadyCitlalicue,2021-01-18 17:17:08+00:00,Am I wrong for being extremely annoyed at this one student and his mom for this?,"A little bit of context. I’m a paraed and our school hours go up till about 1 and then I have office hours until 200. We are all virtual btw. From those school hours I work with 3 different teachers and their classes. A big part of my job is helping lower kids learn to read and help non English speaking students learn English and what’s going on in the classroom. There’s one particular class I spend more time in because that’s how my school made my schedule. And in this particular class I have a student who still has not learned much English.

I completely understand students like this, because I was a struggling English learner myself and completely empathize with them. 

After our school hours end, I have office hours where I contact parents who have reached out to me if they have questions regarding their student, problems with their computers or logging in, and just helping them with any problem or question that comes to them. 

Since the beginning of the school year, I knew how great this students need to learn English was and the need to catch up with our class because he had just came from Mexico back in February of last year. I worked with him when school was still open, and for some reason after really trying to socialize and open up to him, he never opened up to me or liked talking to me, which is different because a lot of students who don’t speak English but spanish as I do, have found a connection to me and feel very comfortable in speaking to me, he never did. Instead of gravitating towards the students who did speak Spanish and were very polite and playful kids, he gravitated towards the 2 REALLY AWFUL students and was basically a little punk. Then school shut down and here were are months later starting virtual school.

His mom starts telling me how he is so low, he needs more translating which I was already providing for but apparently because our school isn’t Dual Immersion, we can’t translate everything and plus, some parents have already complained about not translating everything as it takes a lot of time away which is understandable. 

I then start taking time from my office hours and I make my own zoom meeting for him, just to come up with a lesson plan for every day of the week and meet up with him so he could be better in his English and everything else. He was pretty bright in math but ELA was hard for him. My classes with him started in September and went on until right before we went on winter break. 

After that I just feel so over it and here’s why. The last week before break, I was trying to be fun and showing him a video of Christmas English words and I’m like “okay we’re gonna review the words okay so look at the screen and we’ll say the words too okay!” And eventually after the first video played, I showed him another video and he was just looking down not paying attention. I’d catch him do that plenty of times but I guess seeing him every flipping day of the school year really bothered me. He never really was interested in talking to me or socializing like the other kids I work with, also he rarely made an effort to try and speak the little English he knew like yes and no, until finally I told him he should practice answering in English and constantly kept correcting his response to English. I know you may think that’s a bit harsh but for me, the yes and no words are simple, and not saying this until December when we started in September kinda annoyed me. And it also bothered me that I would tell his mom I see progress in him but she’s then say oh really oh it’s cuz sometimes he can’t understand what’s going on in class and he throws tantrums and I’m like lady I literally tell you every time he doesn’t understand something to tell me in my class or else I’ll help him in other areas. It’s like she didn’t really show much appreciation which other times she did, but that really annoyed me like I’m taking time out of my work day to help him one on one and I’m doing it as a favor, EVERYDAY. I didn’t tell her this but that’s what I thought. Other times I just felt like he just didn’t put as much effort in to the class as he could have. I just feel like he doesn’t care. I caught his dad telling him this same thing which was what I needed to hear, he said that I do this out of a favor to him and he feels like he doesn’t care to try. And I’ve gone over so many letters, sounds, sight words with him and just so many things and I’m just so over the fact that I feel he doesn’t care to try to really know these things and he has a dad and aunt there who speak English so it bothers me that by now especially after spending so many months one on one day by day he still doesn’t remember much. I see him really trying when either his aunt that speaks English is there or his dad. Other than that he’s like whatever’s. I just don’t want to keep having a class with him. I told his mom I don’t have time to have class yet since she asked last week but ugh I’m just so frustrated with them. I feel like they could do a lot more at home and act like they can’t.

jennyjenjen23,2021-01-18 14:16:45+00:00,My favorite two points a parent made in an email to me and my humble responses.,"1.) “You need to reconsider the grades you’re giving these kids...” (edited for punctuation and spelling)

Hmmm...last I knew, I wasn’t giving grades out willy nilly but seeing if students were able to answer questions correctly when asked. If a student leaves that question blank, meaning there is nothing written for it, even the most lax of graders would count off. Also, if I was just giving out grades, they’d be on some weird scale no one else understands (Maebe’s crocodile in spelling would seem normal).

2.) “I know all these kids deserve zeros.” 

Take a moment to stifle your laughter. If we got into who “deserved” what, it would be a bloodbath, especially since the particular class I have this year cheats as naturally as breathing. I’ve watched students pass around one person’s completed work and then everyone turns it in. Those assignments go straight to the trash because I’m not taking my time grading it if they didn’t take time to do it.

I’m pretty lenient when it comes to grading assignments other than manor grades. For homework, I call it Completion+. Since homework is practice, I don’t want to hit a student who is still learning, so if I can tell they made a real effort to answer correctly, they get the points. If it’s one word that has no connection to the topic, is skipped, or is the definition off Google with zero thought to how it would tie into the class (for example, if they were asked to define “bow” and we were learning about the Battle of Agincourt, if they define it as a piece of ribbon tied to the end of a child’s pigtail, it would be wrong) no credit is awarded.

Last semester I was supposed to go to Ireland and teach for 2 weeks as a way of getting insight into the culture of an actual English speaking classroom. This was sadly not possible because of the covid pandemic. As a way of replacing that experience, I am searching for a teacher that would be willing to let me participate virtually in one of their lessons and maybe also have a small conversation about cultural differences in teaching approach and the school system in your English-speaking country. I am very interested in learning more about different teaching cultures and approaches around the world. I know this costs time and effort but as a small replacement I could provide an input for the class and tell them about life in Switzerland or if you give German lessons it would be an opportunity for your pupils to speak to a native speaker."

I am very comfortable teaching the normal calculus curriculum but what these students need is not MORE calculus, but harder calculus problems that test their problem solving and lateral thinking, not just higher skill sets like what is found at university. Scholarship papers don't stray outside of curriculum but instead test their understanding of calculus with uniquely challenging problems that require ""tricks"" to solve.

So my closing question is; where can I find some of these types of problems that I can distribute in class and tutorials to give them that higher level problem solving experience.

Thanks!"

It's my favorite and my students' favorite because they can finally give me some very strong opinions! Last week we looked at The Great Debaters and the debate over whether civil disobedience is moral or not. In order to understand the text, we had to go over what exactly civil disobedience is and is NOT, and various times during American history where it was used.

During discussions, one of my students mentioned that civil disobedience or, at a minimum, peaceful protesting, is the only way positive social change has ever happened. I'm not a history teacher, but I couldn't think of a counter argument for that, and I try to always push back, no matter what side they take (that way I'm not ""pushing an agenda""). In fairness, I told them I'd try to find some times where social change hasn't had a period of  some amount of civil disobedience or peaceful protest just prior. Any ideas?"
newsieducks0506,2021-01-17 04:41:27+00:00,"New teacher jitters, I guess??","So, I was pretty emotional today after the truth just sunk into me that I am not a college student anymore and that I am a newly-licensed high school math teacher. What’s more amazing is that I got hired in a magnet school as my very first teaching job and I don’t know if I should be excited or terrified, but I’m very terrified knowing that I will probably have the whole admin watching me from time to time.

However, I also had to make a quick, maybe life-changing, decision on stepping back on my tutoring job at my local college I work at for 8 years now. I guess my rationale was that it’s time for me to grow as a professional and person, like spreading my wings and fly....but a part of me just doesn’t want to let go of that comfort zone that I had for a long time, where I know what to do in my job and being on auto pilot as a math tutor. I guess it’s because I felt way more confident as a tutor than as a new teacher. I knew the ins and out and the rules in my old workplace like the back of my hand, but with this new upcoming job, I feel like I’m going to do a lot of my own research and digging since we’re all still in remote learning. I really enjoyed my work while tutoring college students since they’re mostly adults now and I don’t have to be always worried about what I should or shouldn’t wear or the way I talk because my workplace really encourage us to be business casual. I know this new teaching job is only temporary because I’m taking over another teacher who’s on maternity leave, but there’s just so many uncertainties I’m feeling that I also ask myself what did I get into. Also, I’m now responsible of these children’s education and that’s a pretty scary thought. 

I’m proud myself on taking a huge risk on this gradual transition from a math tutor to a high school teacher, but I’m also pretty scared on what lies ahead during this pandemic. (Also, knowing that my first teacher paycheck won’t come in until next month and I kinda need the extra income after not having a paid job for months due to student teaching.) Anyways, sorry about this long rant/vent. Any tips or advice for a new teacher is welcome. I’m going to need it very soon."

Vallena816,2021-01-16 22:43:03+00:00,Looking for just the right song to use as an example for an intro to poetry,"In my 5th grade class, I would like to introduce poetry as a new genre for students to be creative and share personal feelings/experiences.

Most of them know nothing about poetry, but, naturally, they all like music. I would like to begin by showing students the parallels between music and poetry. I'm looking for some example songs that have somewhat traditional verse/refrain structures so students can see how stanzas work. I would also like the poem to have repeated phrases (just like how the example poem has the anaphora ""I'm from..."" at the beginning of almost every line).

I [M, 28] am a Primary school teacher currently teaching Year 3 in London, UK. 

I have got an undergrad degree in politics, a years experience as a HLTA at an Academy, a years experience as an unqualified teacher, a PGCE from UCL and 2 years of qualified teaching experience (NQT year and this current academic year) 

I’ve always wanted to teach abroad and think that this is the year that I want to go. 

My main reason for this is a change in environment and financial motivation. 

I’ve always fancied the Middle East (preferably Kuwait, Saudi, Qatar, UAE) and wanted to seek advice from fellow teachers that have embarked upon this route. 
What is the best steps to take? Is it via agency? If so, are there any agencies you can recommend? 

I have a certain salary in mind which is around £4000 a month (which I have read and been told is pretty standard for expat teachers) and wanted to ask whether this is realistic and feasible. 

I understand the whole world is on standstill due to COVID, but I feel that this is the period in which I’d like to capitalise and finally take the step to move out and embark upon my own journey. 

I have seen some adverts that are offering these positions for August, but wanted to clarify whether there are any major and minor things I should look out for before I submit my applications and go ahead with this process. 

Any and all advice is appreciated.

thebeeboy,2021-01-15 19:02:32+00:00,Working 9 hours a day with no break is getting a little tiring.,"I recently took over our ""MVP"" program, which is basically just a partnership with local public schools to enlist their students at our daycare during their remote learning days while their parents work. First, none of the teachers here get paid enough for any of the positions we work. The DOE and executive director of our school have a set salary, so their wages aren't effected by working from home or leaving school early (which they do often). Second, I haven't had a mandated break since September. To ease the scheduling issues while we were understaffed due to COVID-19, I was asked if I could skip my break on the days that I work (part-time). I initially said yes because I really needed the extra money and didn't mind since I had just returned back to work and was weary about losing any more hours or pay because of the pandemic. Despite the fact that our school is pretty much back to regular staff numbers now, I am literally the only person in the building who doesn't receive a break even though there is at least one teacher available, in addition to my executive director, who can easily come to my classroom and break me.

To make matters worse, I also had a rough time receiving my FMLA pay from the company after asking to quarantine due to a potential exposure at my school. I received no income for an entire month waiting for my FMLA pay in between pay periods.

I'm finally looking for other teaching positions in the area. Having to ask to use the bathroom at work is getting pretty obnoxious, and I seriously just don't get paid enough for this.

I have been a long term sub for this school since the fall, where I finished out my student teaching with a full time position being full on, real life teacher. I was originally told they would probably need me until the end of the school year. 

Fast forward to yesterday. As I was leaving, the principal stopped me and said, “Oh by the way the teacher you’re covering for is returning to work.” So I of course ask when so I can start applying elsewhere. And he told me he wasn’t sure. Well I walk into work today, and to my surprise, the teacher is back, here, and ready to work. She told me she didn’t know I would still be here. The principal tells me today that I can stay for another week under sub pay (what I’ve been making this whole time) and basically be an aid for the returning teacher. 

I am just pretty upset. I could have spent all winter break applying elsewhere and getting prepared to have to find a new teaching job. Now I have no time, no job, loads of student debt, and bills. Why wouldn’t anyone tell me? And does anyone have any advice going forward? Should I stay for the next week? I mostly just needed to rant. 

Lastly, the part that hurts the most is how much I’m going to miss the kids. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to comment."

(Some of the more experienced teachers, and maybe even the ones who are just starting out, can relate). And here’s why ...

Not every parent agrees with the way in which we manage our classrooms. I wish I could paint a generic picture to describe just how challenging this role is (in general) let alone during a pandemic. Don’t forget, we’ve gone virtual now too. But I suppose the best way to sum it up, would look something like this:

Your child is in front of a screen with limited range of mobility and a lack of real-world social interaction. This happens for 6-8 hours in a day and for 5 days in a week. They are becoming EXHAUSTED and irritable. 

Now, I am no doctor, but I did complete an undergraduate degree, published a senior thesis, and earned a teaching certificate by studying Behavioural Psychology and specializing in the field of Childhood Development. I might know a thing or two about this topic ...

To be blunt - your kid is pissed, sometimes downright depressed. In fact, I’ve developed a trusting relationship with your little one. My judgement as their instructor, teammate, mentor, shoulder to cry on, and any other label that carries the meaning, “I have your child’s best interests at heart” should perhaps be taken into consideration before you choose to approach my superiors with a concern that (quite frankly) is lacking in credibility. 

Teachers, have you ever sensed a vibe in your classroom? Have you listened to your instincts and exercised your best judgement to better serve the needs of the young minds that were right in front of you, begging (in not so many words) to be given a break? 

Have you ever been called out by a parent whose energies would be better spent cutting their child (and maybe us) some slack? Perhaps giving him or her a pat on the back for doing their best in this day and age (maybe giving us one too)? Or recognizing that there are LIMITATIONS to a child’s brain, patience, and tolerance? (come to think of it ... I’m a human with these sorts of limitations too) 🤔 hmmm. 

It doesn’t take a neurologist to find any recent TED talk, scholarly article, or research study on the effects of increased screen-time on our ability to absorb information. But here, let me fill you in on what I’ve* been learning this year: 

Increased screen-time equals decreased sleep (especially REM), which equals a decline in cognitive function, leading to a decrease in attention, retention as well as memory recall. Simply put - your child is not going to learn anything in the last 10 minutes of class on a 6-8 hour school day at the end of a 5 day work week, despite the number of times that you email my boss to make it happen. 
But hey, I only studied for 7 years, in preparation for this role, to know what’s going on between their ears. 

These are the real struggles of every teacher, even more so the ones who deliver online. We know that you want the best for your child, and guess what? So do we. 
I have been doing everything that I can to teach my students - but with your presence in our virtual classrooms, reaching them can be so much harder.

Please step away from the camera lens. Trust the process. And trust your children.
Maybe even trust me. 

I will be less effective as their teacher and they will be less comfortable as my students if you don’t."
RichardATravels,2021-01-15 06:14:55+00:00,Why Make Fun of ESL and Kindergarten Teachers??,"I've taught a wide variety of things in my career: sciences, math, kindergarten, and ESL.

I have noticed that whenever I brought up that I am an ESL or kindergarten teacher, it is usually looked down on:

""Playing hide and seek isn't teaching!""

""Oh no, like... a real teacher."" 

""How much of an impact can you really make at that age?""

""Playing with 5 year olds isn't teaching...""



These things come from normal people, but they also occasionally come from other teachers. It was something that was really surprising to me when I got into the profession.

Am I a lone case? Maybe I just ran into a few bad apples. What has your guys's experience been?"
dcsprings,2021-01-15 00:37:16+00:00,Last semester I've been handing out exams 4 days before test day because they start asking questions. Should I change?,"Cheating: The worst cheating (several years ago) I've ever had was in a Geography class where the question was ""Why isn't the Earth a perfect sphere."" and a few students answered ""The Earth is an oblate spheroid."" For a number of reasons it was clear that this answer came from their phones. At a minimum it didn't answer why, but even if I gave these particular students credit for that question the still would have scored below 50%. So the cheating I've personally encountered hasn't helped the students and wasn't worth my time to report.

The benefits I see: The ELL's in the class get to clear up any language confusion. The native English speakers get to clear up any language confusion. They ask questions they wouldn't otherwise ask. I teach AP classes, and I'm using questions from the question bank, and past tests so students get accustomed to the style, some of the ""style"" elements are difficult for me to figure out alone, and talking about them in class brings clarity to the students and myself.

Edit: I know I screwed up the title :S"
purplecouchthrowaway,2021-01-15 00:26:27+00:00,Please help me foster better relationships with my entitled parents.,"This is my first year teaching. I teach 2nd grade at a tiny private school and I have a co-teacher/mentor who helps me develop curriculum/work through problems but due to covid I am otherwise on my own in my cohort with 10 students. 

I love my students. I love what we're learning, I love their smiles, I love seeing them grow. I love my co-workers. I feel supported and appreciated by admin. 

But the parents won't. stop. complaining. 

For the past 2 months, there have been non-stop waves of parent complaints (usually the same 3 families). I get at least angry 2 emails at the end of every week. Weeks that I think went great and were successful. 

One parent called the principal on me because I took too long to respond to her email asking me to replace the command hook her son broke that hangs his coat. 

One parent emailed with 10 attachments of her daughter doing multiplication problems at home to say that the math I was teaching was too easy for her and to ask why I wasn't giving her more challenging work. 

One parent's son lies constantly and she believes everything he comes home and says about how mean me and his classmates were to him.

I am trying not to take these to heart. Both my principal and my co-teacher are unphased and say I am doing a good job and not to worry about them, but I take them extremely personally. They are KILLING the joy that I have for my job. Now I walk around all day with parents nagging in the back of my mind, thinking about what they'll say to me later instead of what I can do to better educate their children.

What can I do to stop this? Or at least stop letting it affect me so much? I have started to hate a job I love since it has become so absolutely thankless and full of unhappiness from those I am trying to work together with."
mattashcraft,2021-01-14 22:59:48+00:00,Please give me advice for my 7 year old nephews inability to read/write,"Hello! This is my first time on this sub, but I am desperate. My nephew is 7 years old and has an inability to read and write properly. He was put into a special program at the school but due to covid things didn't stick. He can sing his ABCs and point to the corresponding letter with a few hiccups, particularly the letter H.  


His parents are busy and due to weird circumstances he stays with me and my wife frequently, but we have been ineffective. We have become desperate.  


I am not sure if it is worth noting, but just recently i've discovered he potentially cannot see/hear things in his head. For example, how most of us can 'think' the word, cat. We hear it in our head and we can 'see' a cat. He states that he cannot, and I am not sure if its that I am unable to properly describe how it feels/is, or if he really cant. Outside of a standard potential learning disorder (due to covid he hasn't been able to get evaluated by his teacher for the doctor to diagnose him), I wonder if that could stunt his ability to learn and remember.  


I know that this has been lengthy, but we are desperate and need advice on how we could potentially stimulate him to learn.  


Thanks"
denz88,2021-01-14 20:56:31+00:00,A tool for adding quizzes to online videos,"For the past few months, I’ve been building a tool, Quizbi, that lets anyone create and take quizzes on videos online. The goal is to help people learn more effectively from content that already exists on places like YouTube.

I’ve toyed with this concept for a while now, but the pandemic presented a clearer reason to go and build it. Two observations in particular encouraged me to give this a try.

The first is that remote learning (or any learning for that matter) is really hard for students, their parents, and educators. It’s not uncommon for students to disengage and fall behind. Parents, already stretched thin, have little time to help with their children’s studies.

The second is that most people enjoy watching online videos and they’ve only watched more during the lockdowns. These videos, educational ones included, are by nature engaging and entertaining. Most are optimized for views, likes, and subscribes.

Quizbi puts these well-crafted videos in front of students and gives structure to them. Students receive immediate feedback on their quizzes and can review past results. For an added challenge, quiz takers can also try to submit their own questions that may show up in future quizzes.

I’d love to hear your feedback on [Quizbi](https://quizbi.com) and ideas for how you might use this. And if there’s a topic you’re passionate about, please come and [create a quiz](https://quizbi.com/create)!"
Blair_A,2021-01-14 19:59:47+00:00,Question: do you ever abandon projects in your class?,"Some background: I am a mild moderate special education English teacher and I am teaching 7th and 8th grade. I have self contained English classes. The way our school is set up during covid-19 craziness is I see my students online on Mondays for 45 minutes (a lot are no shows) and then I see them once a week in class for 90 minutes. Prior to winter break we had spent close to a month (or four 90 minute sessions) prepping for a research essay. The kids have been on winter break for 3 weeks and the thought of re-energizing them to write the essay feels daunting. They weren't exactly looking forward to writing it before break either.
Do you ever abandon projects? I don't want all that prep to have been for nothing but I am also not looking forward to pulling teeth for the next 3 weeks to get them writing. Thoughts? Advice?"

Our ACT aspire reading scores went down 6%. Because we have had so many kids quarantined, in and out of the classroom. It’s been hard to keep instruction consistent when I’m having to reteach so much. 

Admin just grilled my team today. I provided 3 solutions. Great! They loved it, but after the meeting, they came back and said “But really, why do you think they went down so far? ”

I’m a professional volunteering in the community, creating and giving an exam to Jr. High and High School Students.  The material lends itself to “Check all that apply” questions, but I’m at a loss as to the mathematically appropriate method of grading these questions.  Obviously, it can’t just be a point for every correct selection, as then the student can just select every answer without penalty.  

I figure there must be some formula that takes into account the number of correct responses and incorrect responses, and perhaps how many total correct and incorrect choices there are in the question.  

&gt; As an example…


&gt; Q) Which of the following letters has at least one curved segment? [Check all that apply]  {Let's assume the question is worth 3 points, or ""V"" points}


&gt; A) A


&gt; B) B


&gt; C) C


&gt; D) D


&gt; E) E


&gt; F) F

Obviously, the answers are B, C, and D, for 3 points.  But if an examinee selected B, C, and E, what would the score be?  What if they selected just B and C?  


Thanks so much."

Jozrows,2021-01-14 01:38:36+00:00,Anyone made the move from elementary to preschool?,"I have taught elementary for 9 years. Mainly the upper grades but I did a year in first. I took this year off mainly because I didn't want to experience whatever mess came of covid, but also to be with my toddler son. 

I enjoy my time with my son and I did enjoy teaching before I had him. I didn't like teaching anymore because of all of the extra time it took from my son due to grading, planning, meetings, anxiety attacks, etc. 

I think that (a private) pre-k would give me more freedom and allow me to allow my kids to be the kids they are. I have fallen in love with my son at this age and how much he loves to learn. Also, it's really actually part time. My fears are: whiners and their parents.

Due to reasons relating to my generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD and just my personality in general,  I would prefer to teach students in small groups(please don’t judge me I know myself very well and this is best for me and any of my future students). I don’t want a classroom of my own. I’d rather pull students for support or push in and support them that way. I love working with children and helping them succeed. I love working in a field of service and it brings me joy. I just don’t want to be a regular classroom teacher. 

I’m wondering what positions in education I can work in that allows for pulling out and pushing in. I’m also wondering what additional certifications, schooling or anything I would need to be able to work in these positions. 

Right now I’m certified to teach in NY state. My certifications are childhood &amp; students with disabilities (birth-6).I also have my masters in educational technology and an educational technology specialist certification. I’m thinking of also taking some classes and getting the TESOL certification - but I don’t speak any other languages...I’d like to learn some basic Spanish to help with this.

Ex: my colleague asks him what his homework is, he asks her if she wants to see his dog. She asks again and he starts to tell her but then will get distracted again and show her something, etc. (He also moves around a LOT and doesn't grasp how to show her things over Zoom). Ideally he needs an adult in the room with him to help him focus but that can't happen at the moment.

I have a full time job, so I would need to do online. I've found SUNY Empire which offers a BA or BS in Educational Studies. Would this be the way to go for a bachelor's for education? Then get all of my certificates and what not after I get my BA or BS? 

I would first like to get my Childhood Education because it seems that's the most surefire way to get your foot in the door and get a job as a teacher. Eventually, I would like to specialize in Earth Science/Environmental Science and the likes and get certificates for these. 

My cousin is a teacher and he said the best route would be to get Childhood Education then get additional certs after. 

I guess I'm just trying to make sure I have a general understanding of what needs to be done before I decide whether to proceed with getting more information from them. 


Thank you!"
slk_thor9,2021-01-12 14:47:36+00:00,Starting pay,"TL;DR one bachelor degree, two masters, what's my starting pay step/lane?

Morning all, question about pay. 

I'm pursuing a career change from environmental planning to teaching. I already have a master of science in environmental education (did not include a teaching certificate at the time I was at the university). I'm now enrolled in a master of arts in teaching. I'll be pursuing endorsements in both secondary English and secondary science. 

For pay - will my first masters degree count toward education in the steps/lanes, or will it only be the new masters? Ex: will I come in at the MA + 36 (or whatever the number is, I've seen it range from 30-36 units), or will I come in at MA only? Or does it depend on district?

Many thanks!"

I've been teaching at an international school in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia for 5 years now. Because of COVID, I've stayed in the country for a year longer than I planned and I might be staying for another year. The job is comfortable, not very demanding, and the kids are great--but the pay is stagnant. I'm able to save a great deal of money and I've paid down over $25k of student loans over the past few years.   


However, I know that this isn't where I really want to be the rest of my life. There's no upward potential. There's no possibility of an increase in salary staying at this school. I didn't intend to become a career teacher, but when I look at my resume now, my 20s have basically been spent in education (2 years in Peace Corps teaching English as well). 

I'm dating a girl now who I'm serious about and she's looking at Master's programs abroad in England and Canada. What worries me is that in an English speaking country, I don't think I'll be able to get a job. I have a BA in an unrelated field (International Relations) and all I have for teaching credentials is an online TEFL certificate. To teach in an English speaking country, I imagine that I'd need a degree and/or a teaching license. 

I suffered from impostor syndrome in my first couple years of teaching, but now I believe that I'm actually quite good at it. I enjoy being in the classroom, I just don't enjoy all the paperwork involved with being a teacher. I'm just wondering what my next steps should be to secure a higher paying job in the future--do I go for a Master's degree? If so, is an online degree enough?

If anyone has any insight, please help!"

I desperately need some suggestions and advice!!

I teach 6th grade social studies near inner city Detroit. I have one class in particular that thrives on group/partner work and has incredibly poor performance and behavior for individual work.

We went virtual in early December and it's been a huge blessing. I'm able to put them in breakout rooms every single day for a healthy mixture of independent/partner/group work. And hey, I was an English major. I love collaboration and discussion!!

The kids are coming back in person next week and I'm stressing about how to keep up the positive attitudes we've had since going virtual. I don't want to cut them off from partners and group work; I already know it'll cause behavioral issues and be so much more stressful for all of us.

I just don't know how to do it right now. We are still in a pandemic. We still have six-foot distance between desks (not that they listen anyways, but I cannot grant them permission). If they're not next to each other though, they'll be shouting.

Is there some sort of online platform I can use for them to be in chat rooms with one another or something?

pushupbra22,2021-01-11 02:19:16+00:00,First year teacher not wanting to return next year,"Hi everyone 

I’m looking to hear from other teachers how they’re feeling about returning next year.

I’m a first year teacher. Graduated in a middle of a pandemic and teach at an amazing school with kindergarteners. The first half of year had its ups and downs but even through all the craziness I believed I would 100% be back next year. Now it’s January, and I feel strongly that I can not do this again next school year.
I know that this was a strange year especially for a first year teacher, but I want to explore other opportunities that have been presented to me. This opportunity would mean getting the hell out of this state and doing something that would pay more as well as improve my mental health.
All year I’ve been told how amazing I was doing and have been given all the support I could ask for. I love my kindergarteners so much and they are definitely not why I even started considering to not return next year. 

The issue is I feel extreme guilt. Guilt that I went to school for 4 years and pulled out loans. Guilt that my parents will think I’m a disappointment. Guilt that I’ve literally been handed the best school and staff, but still don’t want to return. Guilt that it seems like I’m “quitting” on the kids.

I just want to know how everyone else is feeling right now and if anyone is in the same shoes. How are you handling this? Where is your head at right now? 

I also know that I could always go back to teaching in the future or do other things with my degree. Since I don’t have any kids or mortgage and recently have been engaged I feel like this is the best time for me to go out and explore new career opportunities. I would have been terrified to ever take a risk like this before, but this year has opened my eyes so much that I feel like if I don’t then I will regret it."

I feel rude answering the email with anything other than the answer to his question since my thoughts would be “if my teacher had the time to answer the email by telling me to ask a classmate, they could have had the time to just answer my question”, but I also do not want to encourage the emails by responding to them!!!

Ideally id love to say “you email me too much and these questions can easily be resolved on your own, or at the minimum could wait for next class” but I can’t actually do that lol

(I want to guard against potentially being ‘dined-and-dashed’, since there aren’t any legal protections in place, as this is private tutoring).","Hey guys,

I’m a formally certified private tutor for various academic subjects (certified by the Canadian university I graduated from). I’m beginner to private tutoring, and I recently posted a Craigslist ad for $30 CAD/hour (online tutoring and NOT in-person, due to COVID).

I haven’t specified any options for session-length in my ad. I’ve so far only indicated, “$30 CAD per hour (payment currently only via Interac e-Transfer or PayPal, due to the coronavirus pandemic and lack of in-person meeting).” (I just thought I might earn more money if prospective students inquired about session length, where I might have them inclined to pay for more session time, given the open-endedness of the conversation and choice of session length. At the end of the day, I am trying to earn money, right?)

So far, interested students have generally been unsure how long they want their sessions to be. Popular consensus seems to be along the lines of, “I’d like to decide, along the way, how much more time I’d need during the sessions, because I’m not sure yet. Can I let you know as the session plays out, and then pay afterwards?”

I was just worried that with no formal legal protections in place (since this is a private tutoring side job on Craigslist), students may not pay after the session and ghost me (cutting off contact). 

I also don’t want to seem untrusting of them either, or ask them to decide on a session length ahead of time so that they can pay ahead of time (because I want to maximize session length where possible); so, I’m not quite sure how to approach this.

In most cases, the only details I have are their first and last names, and their email address (I usually get these once we’ve confirmed their interest to actually commit to a session). I also have their phone number they’ve texted me from (if it’s not a burner number). I would also know what their face looks like since I’m using video-conferencing software for the sessions.

What they know about me: My first/last names, my email address (I’m reusing my valid university email address which still works fine), and my face due to the webcam during sessions. I actually use a burner number (which is where they contact me in the first place; email is my secondary option) which isn’t tied to me.

How can I protect against tutoring and potentially not being paid by students in my situation? (I realize I may have included lots of extraneous information in this post as well! Lol.)

Thanks in advance."

lyrasorial,2021-01-09 15:29:21+00:00,How to teach unofficial sex ed in the age of Zoom school?,"Hi! I'm filling in for a middle school science teacher on leave during their genetics and reproduction unit. Our students are legally required to have a sex ed course during health class but our school doesn't have a health class so it normally falls on the science teacher during this unit. Their prior strategy was to do an anonymous question box weekly, so they could say ""I was just answering a question!"" Parents aren't always comfortable thinking of their teens as sexual beings, but that's why sex ed needs to be in schools in the first place.

I completely agree with this strategy but I'm worried about doing it digitally. I'm worried their parents might hear me talking about sex when they wouldn't expect it as part of the curriculum (again, even though it's legally part of the curriculum). Although it's a public school in a liberal area, some of our parents are conservative. In person, you can just close the door and say what you need to directly to the kids but now there's a chance I'll be recorded or a parent will disagree with me educating their child on the topic.

Also, in the past if a kid revealed something we need to mandatory report, we could do hand writing analysis to figure out who asked. But if I do a proper anonymous question online, I won't be able to do that. On the other hand, if it isn't anonymous, the students won't ask the questions they need to, and the unit won't be as helpful. 

This is the only sex ed the kids get, and I'm all for preventing teen pregnancies so I really want this to work out. Any tips for how to handle zoom school sex-ed and/or the question box? Thanks!"

Here’s a little (unnecessary) background information: I am an elementary special education teacher so I tend to have close relationships with the parents of my students. This year has been challenging for myself and my students because we started out remotely, then went to hybrid and are now back with remote instruction. Parents have been great about reaching out to me with issues and concerns. Our communication has been very helpful!

Now here’s the actually purpose of my post. Yesterday I had a team meeting with a parent to go over cognitive and academic evaluation results. Without giving any specifics, the student’s scores were neither very low or very high. Going into the meeting, I was looking forward to discuss these scores. Understandably, it can be difficult for parents to hear evaluation results when a child is performing far below grade level. 

Anyway, the parent was very unhappy with his child’s scores. He started ranting about the many things that we, as teachers, were doing wrong. THEN he went on to suggest that we do whatever we can to help his kid get caught up, even tutoring his son until midnight! 🤣

I taught abroad for some language training centers and online. I was making about $3600 a month with just the language center alone. It’s not licensed teaching but you get a classroom full of consistent kids and classroom management is important and you follow a curriculum so the jobs are similar. 

I come back to the US and I find this program for getting my Masters. Here is some of the ridiculous bullshit I’m seeing:

1. You PAY for a 6-8 week unpaid training program that runs from 8-5 every day. Why the fuck.

2. They accepted me into the program without ever having a phone conversation or face to face/virtual meeting with me. Why the fuck.

3. You PAY for your degree, take classes part time, and work full time in an at-risk school where risk of burn out for first year teachers extremely high if you don’t manage yourself well.

Why the fuck does this company suck the life out of its teachers, yet portray the message that they’re helping at risk schools by sending these broke teachers into their schools? 

And then once you’re teaching, you’ll be making about $40000 a year, which is about what I’m making teaching online where I don’t have to put up with bullshit from admin nor issues that students or parents bring from their home life. Plus, I clock in, teach my classes, and clock out, whereas with this, I’d see myself burdened beyond belief trying to manage a seemingly impossible case load for shit pay.

After having had close contact with someone with COVID, I've had to be out all week and part of next week. After three days in my classroom, my sub went to my principal and said she didn't know if she could come back tomorrow because the kids are so disrespectful and never listen to her.

I feel awful. I know I have a hard class, but I know I've also exacerbated the issue- I've been available to my students on Google Meet all day every day to help them if they need it because, as I am not sick, I feel like I SHOULD be doing something, and ultimately it seems to have undermined the sub somewhat. To be fair, it would have been a shitshow even without me making it worse, but I'm sick thinking that this poor sub is so defeated because of me and my misbehaved students.

I'm not getting on Google Meets tomorrow or for the rest of the time I will be out, the principal and vice principal will be dropping in my class tomorrow to remind my students of expectations and make sure they're not being disrespectful. But does anyone have any advice on what more I can do to make this right for my guest teacher? I almost want to write a letter, but I'm not sure how I would phrase it... Any and all advice would be welcome."

I’m a reading specialist and I teach K-5. We started our mid-year DIBELS testing this week (I know, I know, not my favorite measure of reading ability either) and I’ve been testing 3rd-5th grade including my reading support students. They actually made so much growth from September to now! One of my favorite kiddos, a 5th grader from India, especially improved. She came to us in 2nd or 3rd grade I think, and mom and dad speak mostly Hindi at home. I worked with her last year, and she was just stuck in the same place, barely making growth. Then this year, something clicked.

This rockstar of a child punched through that language barrier she struggled with and went from her words correct per minute being borderline intensive in September, to ON GRADE LEVEL yesterday! I’m only in my 2nd year teaching, so I still feel like an imposter and I feel like I can’t take any credit, even though I can.

I’m elated and I adore her. Also, a 3rd grader I work with gave me a sweet ceramic travel thermos, so it’s been a good day!"

mascara_,2021-01-06 02:42:48+00:00,Advice needed for a tired and burnt out young teacher. Please.,"Hi all! I hope everyone who went back to school on Monday had a great first two days!!! 

I just need some words of advice from people who understand where I’m coming from. A little background, I work in a small k-12 district. We have a k-6 building and a 7-12 building. Each grade has roughly 50 Students. This is my third year teaching freshman English, 4 year overall. Last year I loved my job with everything I had; I truly thought I had my life planned out and started working on my masters in curriculum design. This year has completely broken me. Despite living in a county with one of the highest transmission rates in the state my school district decided we would go back hybrid in person. We were the only district in the county that started in person. We were told we would not go 4 days a week because our classroom numbers would be too high and no one would be able to social distance (we were barely social distanced going hybrid).  Two weeks after that we were pretty much told to get over it and we were going 4 days a week. No one was given the option to teach remotely no matter their circumstances. We had teachers who are high risk health wise and pregnant who have been teaching since august. We had 3 outbreaks after going 4 days a week and each time they brought us back immediately after a week of quarantine ( this is not following cdc guidelines for quarantining at the time). Then, they allowed students who were fully remote to return to school making our class sizes even larger. When students chose to go remote they agreed to be remote until the end of first semester. Two weeks later they allowed more students to return. 

We had a larger number of failures than usual ( 12 kids failed freshman classes and 10 of them were fully remote all semester). So they decided to change our master schedule for second semester to accommodate failures. We are now teaching 1st semester classes again, but those kids who are repeating first semester English 1 are also taking second semester of English 1. They made our class sizes even larger and I was told I will be teaching a class I have never taught before with two weeks notice. They did however create a fully remote class which I thought was a great idea because parents kept yelling at me for not paying enough attention to remote students. It’s very hard and I am doing my best. My principal assured me that no in person students would be in my remote only class. That was yesterday, and today I was told a bunch of in person students will be in my remote class. I have 27 students in that class. I feel truly broken by this profession. Almost every Sunday I cry at the thought of going to school on Monday and I am having panic attacks in the morning and driving to work. I don’t know what to do to get me through this year. May seems so far away and I just don’t know how to make it to that point. Please any advice is welcome. 

I feel so alone right now."

therealchrestomanci,2021-01-05 23:56:23+00:00,Student with a stutter: did I do the wrong thing?,"Hello. I've just begun teaching a writing class for adults in which I asked adult students to read a few sentences of their work aloud. I made it clear this was optional. 

One of my students has a pronounced stutter, and tried a few times to read his work aloud before he gave up, seeming defeated, and said, ""I think I just won't read it.""

I asked him in front of the class: ""Do you mind if I read it instead?"" and he agreed. 

I'm now worried this was in some way impolite as it may have marked him out as ""different"" to the rest of the class. He's been fine speaking in class ever since.

In future, should I avoid ""stepping in"" if the student is unable to read out his own work? Or is this an individual matter which is best discussed in private with him?"

I got into education not just to teach (art and drama) but to help fix problems like those that would have seen myself, as an ADHD, dyslexic, twice gifted student, fail out of high school were I not lucky enogh to afford a private school.

STEMforall,2021-01-05 17:17:56+00:00,Please review your salary schedule yearly! You might be missing out on a lot of money,"I'll use a salary schedule near me in SoCal. [This is the salary schedule](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1593153031/losalorg/ab6qmwjs77xzsn0ia3st/18-19Certificated-Reopener.pdf). 

I was recently talking to a coworker who has a year more of teaching experience as me and she found my salary on a public database and was wondering how I made 20k+ more than she did. she currently had a bachelor's degree and a masters degree with 30 units. Her salary was around $76,886 with 7 years of teaching. 

I was making around $105k because I had content/department work stipends. However, with 6 years of experience and a BA+60 &amp; Masters, I'd be making more than her without any extra work at $85,731. 

She's now enrolled in WGU to get those remaining 30 units because if she spends 5k-10k more on 30 units, her salary would immediately bump $12,000 just by topping out the pay scale. She didn't realize this because she didn't look at the salary schedule since she got hired. Back then, it wasn't worth getting the extra 30 units because the pay bump wasn't as large, but now it is.

So... just a reminder to check your salary schedule because you might be only 15 units, or an extra certification away from a larger pay bump. But then again, I understand that this is specific to state and district, so double check if it's been a while :)"

I have always wanted to move away from Ireland, I might as well do it now whilst I'm in my, admittedly late, 20s. The UK seems to have so many other options compared to Ireland where the PME is just a 2 year course you pay to do. I've seen options on tuition free traineeships, salaried traineeships, doing it at Uni, and tbh I'm so confused and cannot make head nor tail of it. 

I had a look at the university of oxford, I know I would never be accepted there I just decided to have a look as I visited it during my UG for a college competition, and the fees were like 10k in pounds, but then when I hit the apply via UCAS button all those other options appeared, I clicked one but they said the program was suspended-the salaried option, so I'm just confused. Could someone do like a crash course and just tell me what the option are and what the best option might be? Getting paid vs splashing out 10k on fees sounds like an obvious choice :P I would be looking to teach science/biology at 2nd level.

I had been actively searching for a full-time position since then and was a substitute teacher full-time for two years.  I have had multiple interviews and I had a few job offers, mostly areas that I could not afford to live like San Francisco.  

Finally I landed a full-time position right before the pandemic in the E Bay CA. and though it was in a demographic that had a high cost of living the pay scale was pretty decent so I accepted and moved for the position, but I still had to have a second job on the weekends because I had a lot of moving expenses from moving there for the job. 

I was a midyear hire and I only worked for two months before I was  terminated without cause.  I’ll never know why I was released but it was two weeks before the shelter in place order back in March.  I was represented by the union and they gave me a lawyer who really said I had no recourse because I was a temporary status. She also said it was a terrible district. 

I moved our of the area right after I was fired and struggled on unemployment among other issues like getting really sick. 

Anyway fast forward now to nearly 11 months later and I feel like I’m going to give up on teaching altogether. I’ve been through so much this past year. I’m currently working in my other field, hospitality  (but I’m prescribed furloughed for the second time this year ) and which I’ve been trying to get out of due to repetitive injuries (dual licensed esthetician and massage therapist )     which is why I became a teacher. 

Also my preliminary credential
expires on June 2021. I can apply for an extension. 

My content area is Art- single subject. I know this is a very competitive position and there are not many jobs  out there but I’m not sure what to do ! Should I leave teaching entirely or maybe pursue something else entirely ? Im very depressed and feeling hopeless. 
I’m just really at a loss and if any of you could give me any advice or if you’ve ever been through this experience I would love to hear anything at all.

MmAaVvAa,2021-01-04 15:59:25+00:00,"Defensive, angry student","Sorry if my english isn't the best. I live in a european country. 

So, I have this student who seems like he's constantly angry. He keeps getting into fights/ arguments with other students and doing and saying things that are not okay. 

The problem is that when I try to talk with him, he just gets really defensive. He blames everyone else,  and doesen't take responsibility for his own actions and words. Of course I'm aware that other students might have done things that are not okay also, and of course I talk with them as well. I always ask what happened, who did what, I understand that you got angry, but you can't kick/hit/ say bad words. I tell him to say stop, go away, find an adult... Sometimes he says that there were no adults nearby, when clearly it was. So he chooses not to follow my tips about what to do when he can't solve a conflict on his own. 

When I talk with him, he sometimes tries to walk away, gets angry, doesen't really manage to explain what happened. Just says that ""Bob is an idiot, he did this and that, so he is just a fucking idiot"". If I finally get him to explain exactly what happened, I ask him what he could have done differently... He just says ""i dont know/ nothing"", or just says that he did the right thing by kicking/ saying bad words, because Bob or whoever it was started it, and they're an idiot. 
If I give him suggestions about how to solve similar problems the next time, he just finds excuses about how impossible it is to follow my suggestions. He just dont want to listen. It's like talking to a wall. 

I have called home, but he hasn't really improved. He was beeing a bit disrespectful towards me in the beginning of the school year (august). I called home a couple of times, and things improved. But now he is letting his anger(?) out on some of the other students. And some of the other students gets really hurt about what he is doing and saying. 

Any tips?
The kids are 9-10 years old.

Many of my students are homeless and couch surfing. It fucking PISSES me off that our system allows kids to grow up like this.

The thing is... there’s a fairly large plot of land near our school. 

WHAT IF we build a dorm. And students could go there if they have no place to go and have a room and food and a caregiver and peers. Like a safe place. Pay students $15 to sustain the dorm  doing jobs like cooking food, doing laundry, cleaning, tutor younger students. Allow them to save up."

WelshDionysus,2021-01-03 12:57:57+00:00,I’m a lazy teacher looking for even more time off,"Okay! I confess it! I’m just lazy!

In the UK right now, there are a lot of crafty people arguing that schools should temporarily close due to covid. These cunning teachers have concocted the brilliant lie that schools are ‘unsafe’ and that there’s ‘no PPE’ or ‘social distancing’. Unfortunately for us, a number of keen-eyed Twitter experts have seen through our lies.

It’s remarkable that despite never working in a school themselves, they have managed to deduce that schools are actually 100% safe. That hundreds of kids jumping on each other at playtime and then going home to their parents and grandparents doesn’t actually put anyone at risk after all!

I thought that when the independent scientific bodies came out and stated that schools are one of the biggest transmitters for the virus which has spiralled rapidly out of control due to government inaction over the past few months, we had them. But alas! They’ve seen through our efforts.

The jig is up comrades. Those fumbling fucking fuckwits have seen through us. I don’t know how these people who don’t work in schools managed to find out our secret that we actually spend the holidays sipping pina coladas while all the marking, planning and lesson prep magically does itself but I confess it to be all true!

I’m ready to admit that it isn’t the case that I’ve very reluctantly come to the view that schools should shut because they’re unsafe and care about the kids’ and their families’ safeties. I’m just fucking lazy and don’t want to work. 

Obviously.

I can only hope they don’t also uncover the secret about how we all go home at 3pm and watch TV all evening before waking up at 8:45 ready for the next day of non-work."

Since fall, thousands of people from around the world have called the Just Scream line and recorded themselves screaming. The line will be open until January 21, and I want to give teachers a chance to share how they're feeling in this strange year.

Here's how to share your teacher scream with the world:

1. Call 561-567-8431. Don't worry, there's no live human on the other end of the line!
2. Wait for the beep, then scream! Make sure to say you're a teacher so I can put your recording in a new collection of submissions from teachers.
3. Hang up when you're done.
4. Check back in 1-2 days to hear your recording [here] (https://justscream.baby/listen).

## Tips

* Start your recording with something like, ""Hi, I'm a teacher in (place)..."" or ""This is (first name) from (place), and I teach (grade/subject)...
* Please don't share full names or the name of your school.
* Follow this project on Instagram or Facebook at @justscream.baby
* Share with your colleagues, friends, and family but not students!"

I’m starting to think no one is. There’s too much. I feel like there is not enough time in the day to fill their emotional needs and academic needs and grade and individualize lessons and tests and the list goes on. I have been fantasizing being a nanny. I’d still be with kids and make the same money (if not better) and just lose the benefits and retirement. I’ve been trying really hard to allow myself to remember I can pick it up again later in life and to just finish out this year but part of me also thinks who cares if I don’t.. maybe whoever fills my place might stand a better chance of helping them get to 4th grade. They are sooo low. And they do nottt care and I don’t know how to make them. I don’t know how to keep the mindset I had of helping my struggling kids prove everyone else wrong when it’s starting to seem like they’re not ever going to. I didn’t want to be the teacher who thought that way. I don’t think I’m cut out for this... and then there’s little moments that make me feel like I 100% am meant for this but I don’t think those moments outweigh everything else.

I need help. 

I started at a Private School when my former job did some layoffs due to covid. I got great vibes from the school, it made so many promises to keep me safe, discussed all the facilities and small class sizes -12 per class, teaching only 4 classes a day with some additional duties.

Well, the beginning of the year, I was put inside a house with 50 kids, 8 adults and told to separate. I taught outside in the rain with students and not teaching meant I was in charge of all recess and lunch duties when the rest of staff got breaks. We couldn't have kids sit in chairs, no desks, no internet, no printer and literally I had them copy things in notebook from a whiteboard like the 1 house schoolroom situation I was in. I shared a bathroom with all the kids because, it was a house, and it often was broken from overuse. The situation was unsafe, and it made me look for other employment, especially when we lost 3 teachers.

I have been interviewing at this other school for 1 month now, and though I started at this schoolhouse nightmare, they finally found a new place for us to go to, in a school that is being remote for the year. It has been so much better and resources and furniture makes it into a real school. I kept interviewing with this other school which has a good reputation but I'm finally feeling content being at my employment.

However, this is where I need help. The new school offered me a position with more money and want me to start in 5 days. I am nervous to switch midyear, thinking of resume and knowing the kids, but I was lied to in the beginning of the year and I am mad still I was put through all that. I need to give an answer by tomorrow and I already asked if I could give a proper 2 weeks and they can't afford to give me that. This raises red flags as well. I'm having serious trust issues with schools and need some perspective. Please help."

wadeboggsbosshoggs,2020-12-28 16:22:50+00:00,How to have fun and be fun?,"So I’ve been teaching for 3 years now.  I’m very academic and love my books and everything English related.  I love reading and writing and academia as a whole.  But I’m also a middle school ELA teacher.

My curriculum is fairy scripted and the lessons are straightforward reading strategies.  I teach the 10 minute mini-lesson and then kids read for 30 mins while I conference with each one and offer reading strategies, etc. 

Problem is, I’m a pretty serious guy.  At home and around others I’m really, really comfortable with, I can let loose.  I’m usually snarky, witty, and sometimes crude with my humor.  This doesn’t translate well for 12 year old children.

I’m finding my days to be very predictable.  Teach the lesson, conference.  Rinse, repeat.  It’s boring the hell out of me.  I teach a scripted lesson and then ask a kid why they aren’t reading at home or why they aren’t doing their journal and my days over.  5 periods a day, same shit.

I want to have fun and enjoy my work and enjoy the kids.  As soon as I start teaching their eyes glaze over.  I have energy and I talk to them very passionately about my lesson.  It’s not like I’m standing there droning on for 45 minutes.  My lesson is 10 mins, quick and easy.  Problem is, none of them listen or give a rats ass.  We are standard based grading so they don’t care if they get a “below basic” on their report card.  

I feel like they all just come to school and humor me by listening to me talk for 10 minutes and they read at school, but it’s so boring and draining.

I can’t really deviate from the curriculum or offer fun activities, my department head is up our ass making sure we do everything by the book and all teach the same lesson at the same time.  

When I taught HS (my first year) I was able to connect with the kids and have more fun with them.  But these MS children are so strange.  

Sorry, this is like 10 different issues wrapped up into one giant post.  

TLDR; teaching isn’t fun for me anymore, it’s boring and predictable and feeling stale.  Need to mix things up and have fun with the kids.  How to keep them more engaged without changing my personality or reading some asinine book like “Teach Like a Pirate.”

Thanks and enjoy what’s left of our break!"

Whether the groups are based on race, sexuality, or disability, there are stigmas associated with people who are different, and games can help students broaden their perspective on sensitive topics like these.

It’s frustrating. I want to be a reliable figure in these kids’ lives in such an unreliable and tumultuous time. They have so little that they can count on right now and I want them to know I am here for them. Communication at my center is abysmal, though. There are considerable language barriers and the place makes it a point to use minimal technology. 

I just want to be able to show my students that I’m here for them. Attachment means so much to kids. What are some ways I can do this even during these times?"

I also feel like it is something I need to do to get out of the rut I'm stuck in and I do want to travel!

I'm a relatively new grad and this is my third year of teaching. I had already been looking into teaching abroad and earlier this year I started to apply to work in Australia. I thought this would be a good fit for me as it's an English speaking country, I could still do all my hobbies, I like an active lifestyle, and even though it is mostly sub work so I may not make a ton (but tbh still more than where I currently live!) I would have opportunity for flexibility. 

However, I got a contract in my desired subject area so I put that idea on hold and then covid happened so I guess it was a good thing. My contract is ending soon and I feel uncertain about teaching during a pandemic here. Australia is pretty much back to normal but now you have to pay 3k to live in a hotel for 2 weeks!

I started looking into other opportunities in China, the UAE, Asia, and Europe. Lots with competitive salaries and who also provide housing, flights, visas, meals etc! However, after looking at a bunch of reviews for China and the UAE it seems like a lot would suck to work there!

Right now I think I would like the UAE, Shanghai, South Korea (I studied abroad there and do like it!), or perhaps somewhere in Europe though it doesn't look like there are a ton of opportunities. I would prefer to work in my subject area but I would also look into teaching English. 

Does anyone have any recommendations or advice as to where to work? I still feel like I would love Australia but with covid who knows when I could go over there and the 3k extra expense is a lot."

KitchenAvenger,2020-12-24 17:46:23+00:00,Am I within my rights or should I suck it up and do what my admin wants?,"Some background: I went to school for secondary ed, tried teaching, felt overwhelmed and unsupported, and since then I've opted for assistant positions instead. I enjoy being in a supporting role.

I applied for an assistant position with a kindergarten this fall. We have smaller class sizes so that we can continue to operate in person, and we do a deep clean every afternoon. Now my lead teacher is leaving for a new position (we had a rough time with some staff cuts and there was some tension between teachers and the board, so she applied for other jobs and was accepted). My director wants me to take over as the lead teacher. I do not want this position. I don't want to work 60 hours a week; I've got a small home business that I enjoy and I also enjoy my free time at home. I've been the lead teacher before and did not enjoy the seemingly endless planning at home (and my spouse did not enjoy it either). 

I told my director that I would be willing to stay on as the assistant, and I will teach the class until she hires a lead teacher, but if no one has been hired by Feb 1st I'm going to start sending homework with kids to ease some of my own workload (currently we don't send homework).

My director doesn't understand why I wouldn't want the position, even though I've explained my reasons to her. Her reaction makes me feel as though I'm being selfish and I should suck it up for the kids. But this isn't what I applied for.

On top of everything, my director wants me to schedule a zoom meeting with parents before we return from break, presumably to explain the situation. She has told me that she has already spoken to some parents and that parents are confused as to why I am not taking over as lead teacher, so I guess I will have to explain myself to the parents at the meeting (something which I am not looking forward to).

What should I do? Am I within my rights to stand my ground or should I ""get over myself?"""

I got my bachelors in communication studies because I didn’t really know what I wanted to do honestly. I always wanted to work with kids but always felt I was too shy and didn’t know if I wanted to get into OT or teaching. 

I worked at a daycare after getting my bachelors and I liked it!! But now I want further my education and teach broader subjects to children. 

Now that I am thinking about going back to school, I am getting nervous. I am not the most outgoing/confident person ever so I fear it will be a struggle for me. I love children and I feel that I am empathetic and caring. 

I believe I am making the right choice, but others fear I am too shy to become a teacher. And now I am having second thoughts."

From a young age I realised that teachers go through so much shit and it got worse the older I got. Every once in a while I'd ask myself what kept them from just saying ""fuck this!"" and quitting? 

Especially once I hit high school. 

And these days I'm even more confused. 

What keeps teachers from rage quitting? (Aside from ""I need a job."")"

I'm currently approaching 30 with MS in Intelligence.

I have a couple years of experience working with children as a swim instructor while going through college where I have gotten tremendous enjoyment/fulfilment. I also personally have had professors that have made an unimaginable impact on my life.

Long story short, I know people do switch careers and others in their later stages of separate career teach a couple classes as a side gig, but as far as the reality of transitioning into something like that is that going to be a very tough change with no financial incentive or more or less doable with the right dedication?"

Fine, no problem, I want a way to see if it's sinking in. Except I have one student (in my head he's Mr. Gortex)  knowledge beads up on the surface and rolls right off. When we were on lock down he joined the Zoom class, pointed the camera at a wall and played games (we could hear them). In class, he does the same thing in his head, he will look right at me and be completely absent. He doesn't do any homework, on exams he randomly chooses answers for multiple choice questions (I teach physics) and writes a random equation to ""show"" work. There are almost weekly parent contacts, and he's very confident (almost to the point of delusion) about graduating and going to college. I don't even need to document anything, just looking at one test tells the entire story. My problem is the quizzes, I don't want anything to suggest progress he hasn't made. I have felt my only option is to correct his quizzes but not put a grade on them (the 100 on the quizzes is a morale boost to most of the students). I don't want to give him anything that is a false mark of progress. Any suggestions?"

Am I crazy to consider taking this or is it reasonable?,"My school has been open full time in person all year. Our cases went up and we made more dangerous policy changes which, as a high risk person, crossed a safety line for my ability to teach in person. This was the point I put in for a work from home accommodation. Starting out I would have been happy to stick with leave provided I had insurance and don't mess up my career but also wanted to start negotiating from the stand point of still being remotely avalible for my students and being paid according to whatever that would look like. 

The district basicly said my insurance is $1500 a month so by working one day a week remotely they will cover that and then I can get paid like a sub if more time was needed for a particular lesson or something. I would have to get the extra time approved on a case by case basis. 

Does this seem reasonable? I'm just so supprised it's even an option that I'm not sure of it.
