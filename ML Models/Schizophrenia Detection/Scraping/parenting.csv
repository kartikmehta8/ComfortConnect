snarkyBtch,2021-04-30 18:25:36+00:00,Clumsy kid is frequently injured,"My twin girls C and A are active 10 year olds.  Both are somewhat accident prone, but C is just killing me with the injuries.  In the last year alone, she broke her wrist falling from her scooter, broke her foot on a trampoline, had such bad road rash from tripping in the parking lot at school that a doctor had to remove the rocks from her hands and knees, and just this week she was hit in the face with a softball (no broken nose but it did bleed for over an hour).  She has a face guard for softball but forgot it at home.  This is in addition to the typical childhood scrapes, bruises, rashes, etc that happen nearly constantly.  Medically she has VERY mild asthma but is quite healthy.  


She doesn’t always pay as much attention as she should to what she is doing, so I’m working with her on mindfulness and “being mentally present,” but it doesn’t seem to working.  

How can I keep this kid safer while letting her stay active?? She has (and except for this week’s softball incident, wears) all safety gear."
msira,2021-04-30 18:24:35+00:00,Parents who live in high rise buildings,"My husband and I have been contemplating on moving out of our current, single family rental which is 5,000 ft to moving into a high-rise building that has a lot of amenities and conveniences (still spacious, around 3,000sq ft). This is purely for the fun of it, because there is a lack of inventory of what we’re looking for in our area to buy (waterfront in Seattle, more specifically on Lake Washington). The building that we are considering is close to many restaurants and parks but I am worried that I’ll miss living in a single-family home even though this would not be permanent. 

Most importantly, I’m wondering if this living situation would be a good fit for a family, given that we have an almost 3yr old and a large dog. So for parents who may have experienced one or both, what are your thoughts? Did your family, especially kids, prefer one or the other? What were the challenges?"
WhosThis85,2021-04-30 18:14:12+00:00,Putting 1yo in her crib at night,"Me (36m) and my gf (31f) are at that stage where putting the baby in her crib at night. We don’t do it every night, maybe 2-3 nights a week. And when we do, she wakes up between 2-5am (8-10am if she sleeps in our bed) crying.  My gf always gets up to get her, but i try to let her know that she needs to learn to self soothe but she isn’t responsive to it. Saying she does not want our baby to hyperventilate or be in distress (which is bs in my opinion). She doesn’t cry hard, it’s more like a ‘come get me’ cry nor  hunger cry or anything like that. I’m at my wits end and don’t want my child sleeping with us until she’s 10 lol. I need tips please."
SadYogiSmiles,2021-04-30 17:59:18+00:00,7yo talking about “fat thighs.” Need help with appropriate response and learning resources,"Yesterday my boyfriends 7yo asked me if she had “fat thighs.” This is the first time I’d heard her ask about herself like that or use that type of language. I don’t want her to have a negative body image.

We asked her if someone said that or if she heard it from somewhere and she says she “made it up” which I don’t know if I believe, but it’s not a huge deal.

I’d love any advice you have on navigating this topic, or maybe some books that you think could resonate? I just know how much I struggled with poor self image and how much it negatively affected me and I don’t want that for her.

She doesn’t have access to social media or the internet without parental guidance FYI. And she is a very healthy weight for her age and size. My boyfriend will discuss the nutritious ness of foods with his kids but we don’t really discuss calories. I don’t shittalk my own body around them ever. 

When she asked the question I responded first by saying that no, she doesn’t have fat thighs. Then I followed up by saying having fat thighs isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I was wearing shorts so I did a little jiggle and said I have fat on my thighs and I think they’re wonderful.

Thanks!

Tl;dr: 7 y/o asked if she had fat thighs and I’d like advice on navigating this topic, including good books we could read together."

angeldeamor182,2021-04-30 17:46:47+00:00,Things I wish my parents would’ve done for me as a child with a disability,"I have cerebral palsy (spastic diplegia); although my case is relatively mild compared to others, I just wanted to share some things that Would have been helpful growing up as a child with CP, things that I wish my parents would’ve done for me, in hopes that it may help other parents of children with CP or with any other disability

Note: The point of this point isn’t to criticize my parents, I know they did the best they could given the circumstances, and I’m now a mom to a beautiful 7 year old boy myself.. so I am writing this from a parental perspective as well.

1. Teach your children (able-bodied or not), that every child is different in their own unique way.  Focus on acceptance instead on hoping for a “cure,” because the “cure” mentality often displayed by my parents and those around me, always made me feel like I was fundamentally broken. There’s a kids book by Sonia Sotomayor called “Just Ask! Be different, Be you.” It talks about the different ways that disabilities impact children, and how some are visible and others are not (ADHD, autism, deafness, etc). It’s a great book, in my opinion. 

Try not to be so pessimistic about your child’s condition, this doesn’t mean pretend like they don’t have cp,  let them know that CP is PART of them, but it’s not ALL of them, and it doesn’t have to define them. focus on acceptance  and highlight their strengths. 

2. research the type of CP your child has has, so that you can explain it to them and they can explain it to others,  for example.. did you know that children with CP tend to get startled more easier than their peers? I’m super jumpy and didn’t know this was related to CP until recently. I also have a poor sense of direction and tend to get lost easily.  Find out as much about their condition as you can, knowledge is power.. 

Growing up, I was constantly bullied in school for walking with a limp due to cp.. and kids (and even adults at times) asked me what was “wrong with my leg” or why I “walked funny”.. and I never knew what to say or how to react.. if I’d known more about my condition, I wouldn’t have felt so helpless or been so down on myself. I would have been able to explain to others what my condition is and how it affects me, and it would’ve made a world of difference.

3. Make sure your child receives any accommodations he or she needs in school. Ask them how their day at school was and if they’re struggling with anything in particular. CP affects us In so many ways than just what’s physically obvious... for example, I find that it takes me a while to Sort through my thoughts and get my ideas down on paper when writing an essay.. but as A child, I was too timid to advocate for myself, so didn’t get extra time on tests  and writing exercises til I was an adult in college, I also started to voice record lectures so I could go over them slowly on my own time... little things like these also make a huge difference. 

4. Teach them self-advocacy skills. Your child may also be too shy or afraid to ask for extra help, so you have to be their advocate.. but also teach them self-advocacy skills along the way. Make sure they know it’s ok to ask for help, it’s ok to ask for more time, etc..

5. Counseling would have also been helpful growing up, to help me accept my condition and be comfortable in my own skin, and teach adequate coping skills (learning to self advocate, voice my needs, be more assertive, how to deal with bullying, etc...)

6. Never underestimate, shelter or stop your child from trying something new. Tell them that they can do anything they put their mind to, even if they might need some extra help sometimes or some accommodations along the way.

I know that cp is different for every child, and some are much more affected cognitively and physically than others.. but the point is to approach the condition in a more positive manner, from a place of acceptance.
I have a much more positive self-image now than I did as a child.. but this is because I took the time to seek help (psychotherapy and medication) as an adult. I have anxiety and depression, and much of my issues stem from the way that having a disability was stigmatized and always viewed in a negative light.. as something that was “wrong” with me, instead of something thats just part of me. 

If they have social media, have them follow others who have thrived despite advertisities.. I’ve come across surfers, body trainers, therapists, actors, etc.. who have cp or similar conditions. It helps to know that you’re not alone and that there are others out there with your conditions who have thrived. Here are a few that I can think of off the top of my head:

Pronetoride on FB and IG (surfer with cp)
@realchelseabear on IG (disability advocate with cp)
@chrisruden on Instagram (powerlifter and model)
And the list goes on..

I also have an IG/YouTube channel where I teach people graphic design, cricut tutorials, how to make custom Tshirts, etc. it’s mostly voiceovers, but feel free to check it out if you’re interested (@NhelyDesigns)

I’m now a senior in college working toward my degree in communication sciences and disorders, to become a speech therapist (with a minor in psychology), and I’m able to see my disability in a much more positive light, but this took A LOT of reframing and conscious effort on my part (still a work in progress). Reframing the way you and others around you view and talk about disability (shifting toward a culture of acceptance) will ultimately help your child be more comfortable and accepting of his or herself."
DAmazingBlunderWoman,2021-04-30 17:35:39+00:00,Craniosynostosis and speech delay,"So my boy was born with a metopic craniosynostosis and underwent a cranial vault remodeling surgery at 13 months.
He's now a healthy 18month old. 

However i'm afraid he might have a speech delay. He's just not picking up any new words. He only uses about three words he picked up before he was one - mama, tata, ""no"" (we're not from an english speaking country). He seems to understand a great deal more - brings his shoes when we're talking about going to the playground, brings his books when i say i want to read him a story, points to things knows his way around a cell phone etc.

Any other parents dealing with speech delay in their child? How do you approach something like that? What can I do to help my son?"
Two_drei_cuatro,2021-04-30 16:54:04+00:00,I volunteered to coach T-Ball for Five year olds,"I was terrified out of my mind. I haven't played baseball since middle school. All those parents looking at me from the benches, watching me interact with their sincerely beloved children.   
I DONT KNOW WHAT I'MDOING!! When I was a kid, I thought adults had it all figured out. I thought they had plans, or at least a general direction. Nope. Adults just wing it.   


I'm not good at baseball, I'm not good at sports. I can't even remember where the players all stand on the field. I haven't played baseball in twenty-five years!! You know what I am good at thought? Being silly with little kids, and pumping them up with positive words. So I fell back on that, and acted silly with them, got them to laugh. Then I pumped them full of 'good jobs' and 'way to go!'. They couldn't see my smile, or could I see their smiles due to mask requirements out in the field, but I could see it in their eyes. Want to do some silly stretches and pretend like we're rocket ships? okay! Lets do it!!  


I did this crazy thing because no one else wanted to, and they were going to cancel the season if they didn't get more coaches. I couldn't do that to my son, who wanted to play, so I volunteered.   


Thank goodness I got paired with someone who at least remembers some basics, but she was just as afraid.   


Pray for me. Haha!"
vero_bero,2021-04-30 16:50:11+00:00,"Potential upcoming travel with 9 year old, how to keep them safe?","We have a relative who isn’t doing very well, we were supposed to visit last year and obviously that trip got cancelled. We don’t know how much time this relative has left and so I’m looking at travel dates right when school lets out. 
I’m still not comfortable with traveling at the moment but we don’t really have a choice in this situation and now it’s just deciding what is the best option. Flying would take two flights at two hours each to arrive and I would obviously have my child double mask, maybe even use a face shield on top of that. Driving will take 26 hours. 
I’ve made a list of pros and cons but I still can’t decide what would be safest. I’m fully vaccinated as is the family we’re visiting so I’m not concerned about once we’re there. Has anyone made a trip like this and what are some tips or suggestions you could pass along? Thanks in advance."
Momcantsleepthesaga,2021-04-30 16:48:52+00:00,Dad and I do not agree on how to parent!,"Before I start I just want to say that before we had a child I had similar parenting beliefs as him. Also I'm on mobile so excuse formatting. 


My husband and I have a 3 year old daughter. She is an absolute firecracker like I'm sure most 3 year olds are. 
Before she was born I was pro-spanking. It's how I was raised and I was in the mindset that it helps make better humans. But the first time I felt she needed any sort of discipline was when she was about 1.5 and starting hitting me a lot. My mom kept saying just give her a light smack on the butt and she will learn. But I kept thinking that it made zero sense to hit her for hitting me. I decided I wanted to follow a more gentle parenting approach. Time outs and discussions are my main things now. When shes older we can ground her or take privileges away of course. But I don't want to use any kind of physical punishments. 

My husband is the opposite. He yells and spanks. (Absolutely NOT abusive I want to point out). He has less patience than I do so I find myself bothered by how quickly he yells at her. He's also started to want to send her to bed hungry if she doesn't eat her dinners. I'm thinking she's too young for us to start this! Absolutely not going to have anything sugary or whatever but a healthy alternative should be okay. 

If I don't follow along with his desicsions he gets upset and says I don't let him have any authority. I'm scared as she gets older she's going to feel like she has to behave different ways with each parent and I don't want that! Any suggestions on how to work on our divide?"

dbthrowawayrowaway,2021-04-30 16:36:19+00:00,"Ugh, potty training","DD is three and started preschool a few months ago. (It was a tricky decision to put her in preschool during a pandemic, but there are very few cases where we live and we judged that the benefits of socialization, learning, etc. would be the worth the risk.) She was doing so well at potty training before preschool -- she was listening to her body cues and pretty much never had accidents anymore, except overnight, which is fine. Now, weirdly enough, she's continuing to do just fine in preschool (they said she's ready for underwear and don't want me to send spare pullups anymore) but she's WORSE at home! It's like she saves all her effort for school and then doesn't bother anymore. Accidents all the time. So frustrating! I guess we're going back to the old system of just making her sit on the potty every hour, no exceptions, until she starts listening to her body again. Anyway, it's not a big deal but I just wanted to let it out ... especially because I asked her ten minutes ago if she needed the potty, she said no, and then five minutes later she cheerfully announced, ""Mommy, I had an accident!"" &gt;:("

bamboodi,2021-04-30 16:20:13+00:00,Demon 8 year old,"Hi everyone. I’m need to this sub. Not sure if I have come to the right place but I’m in need of some good advice. 

So I’m living with my mom rn and she decided to take on my niece (my sisters daughter) when my sister moved out. (For mostly reasons along the lines of my sister isn’t stable yet and my niece has to be in school.) Anyways I’m currently doing online courses (bc COVID) and it’s on me to watch her all the time bc my mom works a lot to take care of us. 

This child is a monster. She never listens to me, talks back constantly. When I try to have a little heart to heart with her and be nice it always ends up coming back on me with her doing some fuck shit. I’ve made her do write offs, I’ve made her stand in a corner for HOURS. I haven’t spanked her (because I don’t feel comfortable nor want to do that) but that’s the only form of punishment my sister gave her so maybe that’s all that works ? 

Anyways she’s having bad behavioral issues at home and at school. But my mom just fucking ignores it, yells at her for like 2 minutes then lets her do whatever the fuck she wants regardless of what she’s done. 

It’s really really making me mad and I still have no clue what to do about it. Maybe I’ll just have to stick it out until my sister comes back to get her but fuck. I’m sick and tired of yelling and being mean all day every day because this child doesn’t wanna listen. Please help. I’m too young to be a mom lol."
PlasticEvidence1,2021-04-30 16:07:17+00:00,My daughters father has been absent for 9 years.,"Just popped up in my messages a month ago asking to talk to her. He has done this a handful of times (maybe 5 times) since her birth. I told him he can’t just randomly show up and ask to see her when he has never showed any kind of consistency, and that he needs to earn his relationship with her. My job is to protect her emotional health and entire being. 

He is now saying I’m unreasonable because it’s been a month of him texting to check in and I haven’t even had her call him. 

Which is true, I haven’t even told her that he reached out. I am afraid he will let her down. 

I do also want to give him a chance to have a relationship with her, if he is going to do so properly. They both deserve that. I just don’t want her getting hurt. 

He does seem more consistent than he’s ever been previously but I am apprehensive to talk to her about it yet and am so lost on the approach. 

Also, we live two states away. 

Have any of you ever been here? 

Why is parenting so fucking hard?"
mardeexmurder,2021-04-30 15:55:45+00:00,How do I talk to my 9 year old about appropriate boundaries with classmates?,"I have a 9 year old son in 3rd grade. My parents bought him a cell phone for his birthday back in December because he goes to karate and due to the pandemic, parents aren't allowed in the dojo, so we would have a way to reach him. He didn't use it very often and I would often find it turned off in a desk drawer or dead, so I never thought to check it. He has an iPad and a Switch and mostly used those for entertainment, so I truly figured he wasn't using the cell phone. 

My son has ADHD and severe sleep issues, so at night he usually puts his electronics in my room, so when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he doesn't jump on the games. When he gave me his electronics last night, he included his cell phone, which was on for once. Once I got him asleep in his bed, I noticed his phone had a notification for a new text message. I looked through his messages and saw that he regularly texts a couple kids in his class. 

Most of the messages were harmless, like asking a classmate if they could go online to play Fortnite or showing friends pictures of our cat.  One of the kids he is texting is a girl that he has talked to me about a lot and it's obvious he has a huge crush on her. He's always telling me about how him and this girl (along with other kids) are friends and hang out in school together. When looking at these messages, I saw that my son spams the HELL out of this poor girl's phone. He'll text her like 15 times in a row before she responds, and does that stupid thing where you send a paragraph, one word at a time, so the other person's phone was constantly blowing up. She'll respond every once in a while, and her texts seem like he's annoying her and she's too polite to say anything about it. One of the things that he does is he'll send her a selfie (nothing inappropriate thank God, just his face) and ask her over and over again to send him one back, which she doesn't do. This I feel like is my fault, because my long term boyfriend of 5 years and I (who my son ADORES and refers to as his stepdad) regularly send each other selfies as our way of checking in with each other since we live about an hour away from each other, and my son knows we do that because he usually jumps in the picture. My son probably thinks this is what normal couples do, and I don't think he realizes how creepy and annoying he's being to this poor girl. 

My son is a very sweet boy, but he is HUGE for his age and very strong (he's almost 5 feet tall and 100 pounds, and all the kids in town know he's in karate and has won tournaments for sparring and weapons training). I'm worried that my son is making this poor girl uncomfortable and doesn't understand proper boundaries, or that she may be intimidated by him. We've had talks before about respecting when someone says ""No"" (Side note: I manage a daycare and after school program, and my son comes to work with me every day after his school lets out. We have another student a little older than my son who attends my school, and the student has a huge crush on one of my teachers. The student regularly tries to flirt with the teacher and makes comments to her, and I have heard my son tell this kid several times ""Stop it (student's name), you're being creepy, she's a grown up and doesn't like you like that.""  Me and him have had talks about how the student's behavior to the teacher isn't okay, so he gets the concept of consent, but I don't think he sees that he is acting similar to the student in my school, because the girl he likes is his age and not an adult.) 

How can I bring this up to him in a way that won't shame or embarrass him, but will get the point across that he needs to back off on the texting and stop blowing up her phone? I want to nip this behavior in the bud now so he doesn't develop unhealthy behaviors towards women in the future. Is this something I can do as his mother, or would it be better coming from a man he trusts, like my boyfriend? My son has no relationship at all with his biological father and hasn't since he was an infant, because his father was very very abusive towards women and had undiagnosed personality disorders, so it's very possible that I am projecting my fears on him, because he tells me all the time about the games him and this girl play in school, and he has come home with hearts and smiley faces written on his arms that he says this girl drew on him. 

I know someone will recommend therapy, so I want to throw this out there now : I have wanted my son in therapy for years to help with his ADHD, anxiety and anger issues, but unfortunately, none of the child therapists that accept my insurance are local to me. The closest one is 45 minutes away, which is just not possible for me to take him to with our busy schedules, or the ones local to us charge about $300/session without insurance, which is completely out of my budget. My boyfriend and I are trying to get a house in another state by the end of this year, so I'm praying that once we move we can find a therapist for him. But until that comes, how can I best tackle this situation? Thank you for reading this wall of text. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Found my son blowing up a classmate's cell phone that he has a crush on, and her not reciprocating his texts. How can I reign him in without shaming him?"

I’m now a senior in college working toward my degree in communication sciences and disorders, to become a speech therapist (with a minor in psychology), and I’m able to see my disability in a much more positive light, but this took A LOT of reframing and conscious effort on my part (still a work in progress). Reframing the way you and others around you view and talk about disability (shifting toward a culture of acceptance) will ultimately help your child be more comfortable and accepting of his or herself.

Hammertime2938,2021-04-30 15:45:05+00:00,My ex husband involves my 10 y/o son in child support disputes - how to handle?,"Background: My ex husband and I divorced 8 years ago and have a 50/50 joint custody agreement. Back then, we both agreed on the amount of monthly child support. We did not have a custody battle. We came to an agreement with his lawyer as a mediator and submitted it to the court for approval. 

This has worked fine for 8 years. It is an agreement neither person is 100% happy with, a compromise that we fought over and hashed out for months. 

Recently my ex husband announced he was adopting his 11 y/o stepson. The boy’s mom, my son’s stepmom, refused to go after her son’s father for child support when her son was born (even though he is apparently well off) because she “doesn’t believe in child support”. The man is not involved in any way with my sons stepbrother. 

Then shortly after, the day I got home from the hospital from having twins last December, he starts harassing me about getting child support lowered. When he doesn’t get the answer he wants immediately because I’m sleep deprived and healing from double childbirth, he starts trashing my family and his wife joins in. (I should add, I am a stay at home mom and that’s what they keep attacking. While I do actually love being a stay at home mom and am very happy about the circumstances, I didn’t initially choose to stay home. I was working on my IT career last year when I got laid off and then we got pregnant with twins. My hourly pay isn’t enough to pay for 3 kids in full time childcare and my husband makes enough + wriggle room to support us.) I ended up just blocking her and didn’t respond.

Then my ex husband proceeds to tell my 10 y/o son how much he pays in child support and that if he wanted something, he just had to demand it from me and that I use all of the money on the new babies. He then refused to give him to me a day earlier like previously planned so my son could meet his new baby siblings. When my son came home, predictably questioning me, I set him straight that it was not “his money”, that it was inappropriate for his dad to speak to him of it, and that I wasn’t upset with him for bringing it up but that this was a subject that needed to stay between adults. I apologized to him for being pulled into it and he honestly seemed so relieved when I took that off his shoulders. I haven’t heard about it since from him. 

A couple months later, I reach out myself to my ex husband and offered him a deal - I’ll agree to lower child support to the requested amount if you let me claim our son every year since he has been with me more like 60/40 then 50/50 for years and because I do all of the main parenting (he just recently has started strictly adhering to his custody schedule but I did not document the past several years. I am documenting now.) He is also not involved in taking our son to his doctor appointments, he’s not involved with his schooling, and he refuses to be involved with the therapy my son is going through to manage his ADHD. My ex husband doesn’t actually co parent with me. He’s a weekend babysitter I’m not allowed to fire. My ex husband and his wife don’t even qualify for the child tax or earned income credits (I’ve heard him gripe about it) so I thought this was a fair deal. 

He ended up thinking about it and was thinking he was going to be okay with that deal. I then told him, after receiving advice from a friend, that I was ready to sign as long as it wasn’t considered a permanent change and that child support could be adjusted under extenuating circumstances. He then once again devolved into jabs and insults and eviscerating me and my husband. 

So finally I decided I’m DONE. I told my ex husband that if he couldn’t be civil with me and hash out a deal without insulting me repeatedly then I was just going to submit to the court for a child support review and let the courts handle it (something you can do every 36 months but I’ve never done once in 8 years since the original agreement). He tried bluffing me and saying “then you won’t get to claim him every year and you lose out on the 2021 child tax credit. My lawyer said I won’t even have to pay that much more anyway if we do it like that, so I don’t care what you do” 

So I said “Fine. I’d like to claim him every year but not at the cost of being repeatedly insulted by you”. He said 🤷🏻‍♂️. Still trying to bluff me I guess because he knows I wanted the new child tax credit for our son. 

So I faxed in the review request form so it can just get straightened out in court once and for all. My ex got his packet today so he knows about it now and is pissed. My son is going over there today after school for his weekend but I’ll have a small window of time to talk to him before his dad gets here because his bus stop is at my house. 

My question is: Do I say ANYTHING to my son? There’s a very high chance that my ex husband is going to pull him into this and try to turn him against me this weekend because he is short minded and doesn’t realize that the only person this will hurt is my son. He can’t touch me anymore but doesn’t seem to realize that. 

I was thinking maybe I should say something like “If your Dad tries to talk to you about adult matters like court and child support this weekend, just tell him you don’t want to put in the middle of Mom and Dad fighting” 

Advice? Bus gets here in a few hours."
angeldeamor182,2021-04-30 15:31:36+00:00,Things I wish my parents would’ve done for me as a child with a disability,"I have cerebral palsy (spastic diplegia); although my case is relatively mild compared to others, I just wanted to share some things that Would have been helpful growing up as a child with CP, things that I wish my parents would’ve done for me, in hopes that it may help other parents of children with CP or with any other disability (note, I’m not bashing on my parent, I know they did the best they could given the circumstances, and I’m now a mom to a beautiful 7 yr old boy myself).

1. Teach your children (able-bodied or not), that every child is different in their own unique way.  Focus on acceptance instead on hoping for a “cure,” because the “cure” mentality often displayed by my parents and those around me, always made me feel like I was fundamentally broken. There’s a kids book by Sonia Sotomayor called “Just Ask! Be different, Be you.” It talks about the different ways that disabilities impact children, and how some are visible and others are not (ADHD, autism, deafness, etc). It’s a great book, in my opinion. 

Try not to be so pessimistic about your child’s condition, this doesn’t mean pretend like they don’t have cp,  let them know that CP is PART of them, but it’s not ALL of them, and it doesn’t have to define them. focus on acceptance  and highlight their strengths. 

2. research the type of CP your child has has, so that you can explain it to them and they can explain it to others,  for example.. did you know that children with CP tend to get startled more easier than their peers? I’m super jumpy and didn’t know this was related to CP until recently. I also have a poor sense of direction and tend to get lost easily.  Find out as much about their condition as you can, knowledge is power.. 

Growing up, I was constantly bullied in school for walking with a limp due to cp.. and kids (and even adults at times) asked me what was “wrong with my leg” or why I “walked funny”.. and I never knew what to say or how to react.. if I’d known more about my condition, I wouldn’t have felt so helpless or been so down on myself. I would have been able to explain to others what my condition is and how it affects me, and it would’ve made a world of difference.

3. Make sure your child receives any accommodations he or she needs in school. Ask them how their day at school was and if they’re struggling with anything in particular. CP affects us In so many ways than just what’s physically obvious... for example, I find that it takes me a while to Sort through my thoughts and get my ideas down on paper when writing an essay.. but as A child, I was too timid to advocate for myself, so didn’t get extra time on tests  and writing exercises til I was an adult in college, I also started to voice record lectures so I could go over them slowly on my own time... little things like these also make a huge difference. 

4. Teach them self-advocacy skills. Your child may also be too shy or afraid to ask for extra help, so you have to be their advocate.. but also teach them self-advocacy skills along the way. Make sure they know it’s ok to ask for help, it’s ok to ask for more time, etc..

5. Counseling would have also been helpful growing up, to help me accept my condition and be comfortable in my own skin, and teach adequate coping skills (learning to self advocate, voice my needs, be more assertive, how to deal with bullying, etc...)

6. Never underestimate, shelter or stop your child from trying something new. Tell them that they can do anything they put their mind to, even if they might need some extra help sometimes or some accommodations along the way.

I know that cp is different for every child, and some are much more affected cognitively and physically than others.. but the point is to approach the condition in a more positive manner, from a place of acceptance.
I have a much more positive self-image now than I did as a child.. but this is because I took the time to seek help (psychotherapy and medication) as an adult. I have anxiety and depression, and much of my issues stem from the way that having a disability was stigmatized and always viewed in a negative light.. as something that was “wrong” with me, instead of something thats just part of me. 

If they have social media, have them follow others who have thrived despite advertisities.. I’ve come across surfers, body trainers, therapists, actors, etc.. who have cp or similar conditions. It helps to know that you’re not alone and that there are others out there with your conditions who have thrived. Here are a few that I can think of off the top of my head:

Pronetoride on FB and IG (surfer with cp)
@realchelseabear on IG (disability advocate with cp)
@chrisruden on Instagram (powerlifter and model)
And the list goes on...

SuperSpyRR,2021-04-30 15:29:00+00:00,Getting a Puppy shortly before having ours first child. Good or bad?,"We’re due with our first child in January, and we want to get a puppy. Is this a good or bad idea?

We’re aware puppies can be a lot to handle. To help with that, we plan to send our dog straight to a well respected trainer to potty train it and such before it enters our house.

Is this advisable, or are we crazy?"
jodikenn,2021-04-30 15:15:10+00:00,Parents of those with spina bifida occulta or polymicrogryia,"Hello everyone, my four-year-old son had an MRI last year that stated he had “spina bifida occulta on L5 and distal tip of conus of L2 which is at lower limits of normal”. Our neurologist never informed us of this but instead told us he had polymicrogyria. I happen to be reading over past MRIs yesterday (to understand his PMG since after a year later our neuro hasn’t made any plan for him)and Happened to catch that diagnosis. I’m just wondering if anybody else is in that same boat as far as diagnosis goes. 

My second issue is after we receive this MRI and although my neurosurgeon never told me this or neurologist for that matter my son was seen by a physiatrist at a different local hospital and with the information they had at the time they decided to give my son Botox two times under anesthesia in his legs because we thought it was just a tonal issue. Now I can’t help but be angry because with the new knowledge of the spina bifida diagnosis I’m pretty positive that Botox would have been no help given the circumstances. I wouldn’t have put him under two times if I knew this diagnosis before hand. I’m just trying to have some feedback from maybe somebody who has been in a similar situation and have some advice. It’s very clear I’m getting a new neurologist and neurosurgeon team but should I be looking at a lawyer for them not telling me about this diagnosis and him having that procedure after? 

I hate to be that person but my sons been under a significant amount of surgery for such a small age that any anesthesia is so crucial for him to receive and the fact that this wasn’t even a helpful procedure makes me so upset. I hope this makes sense."

I gained a bit of weight since lockdown and being out of my usual office routine, which included an exercising commute and different breakfasts/lunches. I am about 5-10 lbs overweight, which isn’t a lot, and I don’t feel that I look bad. I would like to fit in my work clothes again and get back the energy I had. Our family eats healthy and has daily low-moderate intensity workouts.

I started IF this week, skipping eating dinners, to get back to the middle of my healthy BMI range. The problem is my husband keeps commenting in front of our son that I look great and don’t need to lose any weight. My son repeats the same thing now. 

Any recommendations how to have a healthy discussion about getting back on track?"
Midwestmamax2,2021-04-30 15:02:49+00:00,Do you think school district really matters?,"I’m curious what others think about the topic of school districts.

I was reading a report about the top school districts in my state. All of them are in well off suburban areas.

My husband and I would probably never be able to afford to buy real estate in those districts.

We live in a working class suburb that has average schools. They’re better than the schools in our urban area but not as good as those in the fancy suburbs.

Part of me thinks that kids from those top rated schools perform better because of their better socioeconomic status and the benefits that are allowed by that.

What do you think?"

We can’t a say much as it’s their kid but me and my wife wonder if we will also be like that when our kid is that old. I wonder if kids that age needs to be disciplined such a way that they understand disappointment in life and learn to let go of stuff sometimes?
DogeManin,2021-04-30 14:49:36+00:00,Teen cut her arm this morning and I'm not quite sure what to do.,"We have twin 13 year old girls and they really struggled during covid. Their fighting went off the charts and they've been doing therapy for several months now. It seemed to help the fighting but other things are getting out of hand. 

Yesterday we caught one of them (we'll call her A) stealing cash from us to buy vapes. Disappointing but not entirely unexpected. The second we find out, she runs away. She wasn't getting yelled at, we don't have a history of freaking out or hitting, we didn't even have a chance to talk about. She just ran and this is not the first time. We called the police but ended up hearing from her friend a few hours later. Mom picked her up and we talked about the stealing. The money must be earned back and she loses her phone. We moved on and she even did her chores.

This morning she refuses to get up, finally gets up way too late, and is in a rush to get ready for school. She can't find her nails. She starts crying and throwing a tantrum about how her sister must have stolen them. She grabs a knife and starts slicing her arm in the kitchen. I stop her and her mom guides her outside and they leave for school with her screaming about how her life is over and she's not going to school without her nails. 

And that's where we're at. This 100% will continue at some point today. It always does. The nail thing is not new behavior. But the arm slice is. Not sure what to do about that part."
Delimadeluxe,2021-04-30 14:43:56+00:00,Parents are real life ninjas,"It takes some serious muscle control to quietly move away from your baby that has fallen asleep against your body. 
Mattress can’t move and there should be absolutely no sound cause if baby wakes up the world ends... 

And then you have to flex extra hard when you in mid-movement lose control of the situation and your abbs have to save you by keeping you in this tai chi looking vertical position until you regain your balance and do a parkour roll off the bed and kind of have to keep rolling while you have reached the floor to avoid any noise. 

Parents rock.

TegiePie,2021-04-30 14:37:37+00:00,Autism and sleep,"Hi all
Looking for some advice regarding autism and sleep in toddlers.

My 2yo has recently been assessed for ASD (waiting for official diagnosis). It really doesn't bother me, just gave us an understanding to his odd behaviours.

His sleep patterns have always been irregular, but the last 2 months have been pretty bad. He goes to bed at 8.30pm but can be up at 12, and stay up til 6/7am.
If he has a nap during the day (1 hour at most) he doesn't want to sleep until midnight, and will be up at 5am.
His daily routine doesn't alter very much, same with the bedtime routine. Dinner at 5.30-6pm, play until 7.30, has some milk, bath, brushes His teeth and then we start the process of getting him to sleep. Unless he gets really upset, we try to get him to fall asleep in his bed.
He gets heaps of exercise during the day, and we avoid sugar and processed foods.

Some advice would be great. I'm a bit stuck as to what else we can do to help him sleep better.
We've tried all kinds of night lights, sleep-aid fragrances, blankets, changing little things in his bedtime routine. Our paediatrician even prescribed some melatonin, but that only lasted one night. He had a mild reaction to it, which left him screaming all night.

I'm worried his sleep is starting to effect his energy levels during the day, in turn his learning abilities.

Thanks in advance"
itsfrankgrimesyo,2021-04-30 14:30:19+00:00,Kids NEED to go back to school and be around their friends!,"We’re going through a 3rd  wave so still on lockdown. My kids (F5, M7) are home doing distance learning. Just like most parents out there, I’ve had enough. 

My daughter is very shy, more than your typical child. When she started JK, she had a hard time adjusting. She started to make progress around end of the year, teacher said she was finally coming out of her shell and making friends. She was starting to enjoy going to school. Then she started SK, still shy but continued to make progress during first semester, started having “best friends”. Teacher said she still needed encouragement to speak up in class but overall there was progress, I was so happy. Then BAM, covid happened.

Since then it’s been on and off. Distance learning, no back to in person, no, it’s not safe back to distance learning (if you live in Ontario then you know what I’m talking about, our government has been flip flopping and gave parents a days notice). I can see my girl regressing. Shes back to being super shy, to the point she refuses to even go on camera during class, won’t participate even when the teacher asks her questions, she said it’s because she is shy. She doesn’t pay attention, even when we sit next to her to help. 

She is only interested in playing with her older brother. And we can’t go anywhere, still on lockdown. 

I’m venting today because I got triggered, some idiot said parents who want their kids to go back to school because it’s “free-babysitting”. No you ignoramus!!!! Kids need to socialize for their mental health well-being!!!!  

I know there’s nothing I can do, the rest of the world is going through the same if not worse. But the next person who calls school “free babysitting” can go eat a dick."

We go to the playground often which he loves. But he’s never interacted with another child and hates when one comes near him. He looks for the areas that are empty vs the areas I know he’d prefer. 

Yesterday we had our first organized group event ever: a little soccer camp for 3 year olds. Parents are allowed the whole time so my husband was next to him the entire time. He just cried the whole time. He was so afraid of the other kids, someone taking his ball, etc. He wouldn’t do any of the activities the coach did. He isn’t defiant, just frozen. It just broke my heart. He loves to play soccer at home. 

I’ve signed him up for small group swim lessons, gymnastics and some short preschool camps this summer. He’s signed up for preschool in the fall. I’m terrified he just won’t acclimate. If he won’t participate or even just be calm with a parent with him, how will he do it on his own?"

My wife and I are having problems with him being very dependent on my wife. He is only breastfed and will not take a bottle from me or my wife, only my mother in law. I have been trying for the last two weeks since my wife is returning to work. Every day I try a bottle (we have gone through Avent, Tommy Tippee, and mum bottles, I am waiting for Munchkin latch and Nanobebe bottles) but he just flicks the nipple with his tongue and does not drink any. He also will not go down for a nap without first being on the breast for comfort so I cannot get him to sleep either. 

So long story short, when my wife goes to work and I am taking care of him, he barely eats and sleeps until she comes home which means a non stop crying fest all day. I feel so useless and frustrated because I am not able to contribute as much as I want and my wife is absolutely drained all the time because of it.

mustangcbra,2021-04-30 14:06:38+00:00,Son having extremely difficult time moving between homes and missing mom,"Friends,

My son (8) is having an extremely difficult time moving between homes. So difficult that, he is crying at pickup, crying when he gets to my home, breaking down before school starts and having meltdowns at night before bed. He says it’s all about missing mom when he is feeling this way 

His mother and I have been separated for two and a half years and divorced for a year. I am on my second year of living in a new home. I’ve gone to great lengths to make the house comfortable for the kids and ensuring this is a safe place for them physically, emotionally and spiritually. 

His mother lives in our old home(5 minutes away), in our old Neighborhood and he spends 50% of his time there. There he is able to have his friends and everything that’s familiar to him. Here it’s a new home with few friends but I do my absolute best to make it fun while he is here. 

I know my profession as a military pilot does not help this poor kid, I’m gone for days sometimes weeks at a time and he spends that time with his mother. Luckily I am leaving the military soon and transitioning to a civilian flying job that allows me to be home more. I will say, this is all he has ever know so he is used to me being away.

He has recently started counseling again and I’m doing all that I can to help him through his emotions and empower him to tackle these things and self soothe. As a parent this rips me apart to see him like this. He has a five year old sister that does not display any of these emotions and is super happy through all of this. 

Has anyone else faced this? How do you help them through it? This has been going on for two months now and it’s wearing me down and straining our relationship with each other."

Jeezelauise,2021-04-30 14:02:33+00:00,School change for SS advice,"My SS currently goes to a private school in our neighborhood. This school was great for kindergarten because it was all day and BM thought it was neutral ground. After he's been there a couple years there's a fee flaws. One is that he has one teacher for two years who teaches everything. Music, Spanish, History for two years. (I think music is super important personally to be taught by someone who has a music background, also varied opinions overall is beneficial in learning). He's also had a lot of issues with friends and bullies all year. This kids at this school also function different. I've tried to make friends with parents for play dates and they don't seem to either understand or be interested so he never has friends over or has birthday parties of the likes. We want to move him down the street to a public school that would cover these issues and BM agrees.

Now my SS has anxiety and is neurotic. He wanted to move before but now he doesn't and he's very anxious about it. I am also worried he's going to get his mom to say no. It feels mean to go against his wishes but my husband and I feel this new school is going to be substantially better for his overall development. He would actually have kids in the area to hang out with and have a more varied education.

Are we incorrect for pushing this? Is there a better way to approach it with him other than ""too bad deal with it"" ? I want to do what's best but also don't want to cause him anxiety."
moosebeast,2021-04-30 13:47:39+00:00,"18mo only wants me, not partner, to come to him at night","Hello, 38(m) father of an 18mo boy here.  His sleeping has gradually improved over the last year or so to the point that he does occasionally sleep through the night without waking up until morning, however he does tend to wake up once or twice and need comforting to go back to sleep and sometimes he'll have a rough night as toddlers sometimes do.  I just pick him up, give him a cuddle until he seems settled, and then put him down - he's usually able to settle himself to sleep from there.

The problem we're having is that he only responds to me.  If my partner tries to go to him, he literally pushes her away and doesn't want her to pick him up.  He just gets more upset if she does.  Possibly this is because once she stopped having to breastfeed, I started being able to go to him at night and basically took over night duties, so he's gotten used to me now and not her.

It's becoming a bit of a strain because it's always me losing sleep if he has a rough night.

I should note that he is perfectly fine with her during the day and they have lots of fun together and he often wants cuddles from her during the day, just not at night.

Has anyone else had experience like this, and did you manage to get them to accept cuddles from the other person at night?"

Yesterday I got my first bad behavior report from the daycare.  She is a twin, and we knew she would be the one to get one first, but we didn’t expect it this soon haha. 

Her teacher told us that she was throwing away her food and eating off the other kids plates. This was an issue we have had at the house but after reading what other posters had put on here about their kids eating off their plates we opted for allowing her to eat off our plates as it sounded like it was kind of ingrained and an evolutionary quark- kid eats what parent is eating because that is safe/not poison. 

Well, now we know that she is doing this at daycare too, we have to do something. We found out today it’s a kid with autism who’s plate she is eating off of.  I don’t know the specifics of this other child’s condition, but I can’t imagine they enjoy my kid taking their food or messing with their plate. 

What do we do?"

My husband and I have always been travelers, nomads, discontent to stay in the same place for too long etc and now that we have two kids (2.5 and 6 weeks) we are thinking about picking up and moving somewhere away from NJ, somewhere warm and somewhere we like the general vibe of. Work isn’t an issue since we both can do our jobs from anywhere but we will be moving away from our family. 

For the people who made a big move (by choice) away from family how did your kids adjust? How did you adjust? We don’t have parents babysit very often but it does make me a little nervous my 2 year old will miss the cousins and grandparents. Other than that, should we think about anything else? Thanks!"

We put baby to sleep around 11pm and I usually go to sleep around 12/1am to get 8 hours before I have to get up at 930am. 

Girlfriend doesn’t go to sleep around 4-5am every day and then when baby wakes up around 7 she wants me to wake up early and watch her before work. 

This morning I got 5 hours of sleep and she just had me call off work because she slept from 4-7am and I’m up WELL before my shift (before I called off) watching baby. 

Does this seem fair to you guys? I just need advice because my job is very physical and I need my 8 hours before a 10 hour day of this stuff and then coming home to take care of baby as well.

The only thing is he is very never-minded with his responsibilities like making his bed, taking dirty clothes to the laundry room or even taking his lunchbox out of the school bag.

We have tried so many routes - positive reinforcement, not doing it ourselves so that he doesn't have any lunchboxes for school, I've begged him, I've shouted (don't @ me, imagine walking into a bathroom every day and the toilet has poop and it's never flushed). I've talked about it with him, asked what's happening, explained why we ask him to do the things we ask. I've explajned that I have to do everything around the house, and I really appreciate him helping me with things like picking his clothes up. Nothing changes.

Am I expecting too much? He turns 8 in October, I think he should be able to handle those types of things. How else can I get through to him before I lose my mind?"

So she covers my nose with her mouth and then starts laughing out going Ahhhhhhhhh! And her face is so bright and funny. It just lights up when she does it!

It’s really cute, but also slimy haha 

Why is she doing this? I like to think it’s her version of kisses, but I know she seems too young to comprehend that."
AnonIntrovert08,2021-04-30 11:08:24+00:00,Parenting Rage...please help,"I feel the need to preface this by saying that my DH isn’t a terrible person. He has many good qualities and is in many ways a great partner and father. But this particular thing has become a major issue. 

My husband is really struggling with anger. Our son (age 7) is smart, verbose, strong willed, and currently being assessed for ADHD. Husband finds it very difficult to control his anger and attitude when DS misbehaves...which leads to escalating behavior/attitude from DS and they just ramp each other up to yelling and total disrespect. To my ears, DH sounds so venomous when he’s angry. He talks about feeling his blood pressure and heart rate rise and his head feeling like it’s going to explode. To me that just seems like an abnormal adult reaction to normal childish misbehavior. 

DH has such a short fuse, I feel like the smallest things set him off (example: DS brushes against the wall absent-mindedly and DH says, “Don’t touch the wall! How many times have I told you not to touch the wall!” And then this somehow turns into a huge fight). In my opinion, many of these power struggles would never happen if DH could just learn to choose his battles and not point out every little thing. DS must sometimes feel like he never does anything right. He recently told DH that he feels afraid of him sometimes. DH’s interpretation is that DS is trying to manipulate him by saying that. I think DS was trying to be honest; DH can be fun and pleasant to be with BUT he can be frightening when agitated. 

In general I feel like DH expects DS to behave and reason like an adult. Honestly, he expects more self-control from DS than he is willing to put forth himself as a fucking full grown adult. How can someone expect a child to learn to be respectful when disrespect is modeled? DH will say “BUT I’M THE PARENT.” Meaning it’s OK for him to act that way. To me he looks like a tantruming toddler who wants to look big and strong; it’s hard for me to respect that in a grown man, so probably hard for DS too. I just...expect better from an adult. I’ve tried telling DH privately that I never want DS to speak to another person that way, so please don’t model that for him. He doesn’t see anything wrong with it. He’s the parent. He’s the big maaaan of the house. 

I try to play peace maker and get them both to calm down and de-escalate. Then DH is angry with me for what he views as me not taking his side. Accuses me of disrespecting him and choosing DS over him. I’ve told him so many times that I’m trying to help them both calm down and speak respectfully, but he does’t ever really get it. We’ve discussed this over and over. I’m so sick of it and hate that I see DS emulating husband’s behavior (he hates when DS does it but doesn’t realize that it mirrors his own behavior). After DH and I privately argue the same soul-crushing argument, he will come to realize that he was out of control and talk about doing better. Then a few days or even hours later it all happens again. 

Bottom line - this is a huge problem. DH learned this behavior from his father (who DH acknowledges had major anger issues and was frightening to him as a child). I’m afraid my son is learning to do the same. I resent DH. Last night after the kids were in bed we fought about this (again) and I got so frustrated that I told him I hate him sometimes. It was a terrible thing to say but I can’t bring myself to try to correct what I said. I don’t hate him exactly but I hate this part of who he is. 

DH will not get therapy (I’ve asked many, many times). Leaving is not an option. Apparently listening to me is not an option to DH. So...what’s left? I feel completely helpless, powerless, and frustrated by this cycle of anger. Any books, online courses, etc. helpful for anger issues? Partly I just needed to vent because it feels hopeless but maybe there’s SOMETHING that could help."

narratoritwasnt,2021-04-30 09:51:54+00:00,Looking for toy/activity/creative suggestions for an almost 5-year-old,"Hi parents,

With 14 months of counting of COVID (we're in Europe) my almost-5 year old son is often home at least a couple of days during the week from preschool (it keeps going in and out of emergency care) and I have a 2 year old as well. The 2 year old still naps during the day and of course on weekends too, so during naptime, I have to have some activities to keep my older one occupied so I can actually get some work and household tasks done. He's getting a bit bored with what we currently have in rotation which means he basically wants attention most of the time, so then I can't get much done. I'm looking for some fresh ideas of toys or activities for him to do that aren't just watching movies. 

Here's what he already likes: books (including listening occasionally to audio books), Duplo (he's starting to get into Lego too), art projects (but this usually only occupies him for maximum 10 minutes at a time), imaginary play. He will still occasionally play with Brio trains and some toy animals and vehicles. Some of his interests are buses and trams, the ocean (he loves Finding Nemo and things like sharks and fish), the movie Frozen, anything to do with Winnie the Pooh, and numbers and letters, he is currently figuring out how to read and can actually do a lot of first and second grade level math problems. 

If anyone has some suggestions of what else to try or some toys their 5 year old really loves that I haven't thought of yet I'm all ears."

We were supposed to have dinner together with my kids this past weekend. He post poned because he wasn't feeling well. No big deal, but I'm potty training the toddler this week. I let it slide, I didn't follow up till Wednesday. I couldn't get in touch. Same story yesterday. I asked my brother to go check on him as he lives closer... He was gone.

Dad's hug your babies for me tonight and today, I know I wish I could hug mine right now. Just one more time I would give all the money in the world to hear him say my nickname.

I swear my oldest son (2 yo) knew. He woke up from a nap asking for grampy, all afternoon, on Tuesday. We hadn't discussed anything about a visit, since my dad had postponed (I do this on purpose because I've seen how hard it rocks their little worlds to have plans change at the last minute when they really want something).

I like to think he came to say goodbye. 

How do you explain this final goodbye to a 2 year old?

I hate this. I hate it fully. He was supposed to be here for a much longer time. We have memories he needs to be a part of. It's not fair. 

Thanks for reading if you did ❤️ if you are having trouble sleeping, think of a yellow raft in the middle of the bright blue ocean, with the warm sun and beautiful clear skies above, and a pleasant breeze. Allow yourself to get fully enveloped there. It was my dad's trick for getting me to sleep when I couldn't when I was little."

Especially without reason. 
Should I waste my time and trying to get him to go to therapy with me? Should I just do what’s been in my heart and on my mind and just listen to my psychologist who wants me to finish this up and then decide? Or listen to my husband who is clearly abusive and manipulative and begging for more chances?"
meat-delivery-system,2021-04-30 07:33:43+00:00,Four Month Sleep Regression,"I’m currently in the thick of this phase with my 16wk old. She is co-sleeping in a sidecar cot next to the bed, and will put herself to sleep after being fed and changed throughout the night (currently waking 4 times a night instead of the previous two), and is being breastfed.

But what is going on with the daily naps?! She has never been a “good sleeper” when it comes to daytime napping; 20-40min and then bam. Wide awake for another 90-120mins. She usually sleeps in a baby sling so that I can get something done around the house, although she will also sleep sometimes from being nursed. Sometimes she will spontaneously fall asleep in her bouncy chair or baby nest.

But damn, the last few days have been horrendous. She is exhausted, sometimes to the point of total baby meltdown, and nothing seems to be consistently working. When she does fall asleep it will sometimes only be for 5 minutes! Then she’s awake again, but clearly still exhausted and once again refusing to go down.

What have been your experiences of sleep regressions, and how have you handled them?"
intlmanofmystery1,2021-04-30 06:33:09+00:00,Super frustrated dad here. Toddler (18mo.) has stopped putting himself back to sleep...,"Every night around midnight toddler wakes up. I go in, change their diaper, sit with them for a few minutes until they’re back to sleep.

For a while it maybe took 30min. tops. However, lately it’s turned in to 2-3, sometimes 4 hours of screaming and tantrums only for them to wake up at 7am again. 

I’m out of ideas here. No matter what I do, they won’t go back to sleep. They’re fully capable of it. They’ve done it many nights before. But this is turning into an every night thing. 

So me going to bed about 10/11 to wake up at 12. Be up until 4, then need to wake up at 5 for work is not going to be very good.

What else should we do? I think he’s gotten too used to me sitting in there with him that he doesn’t want to be alone now. What will often happen is they fall fast asleep, I tiptoe out, then five minutes later they roll over to see one of us not in there and has a meltdown."

I get home and my son tells me that he got into an altercation with a group of older boys and the things they said to him.  Now I know most parents think their kid is infallible but my son is a soft boy.  My partner and I have had many talks about this (not in a queer Id way, more like fear he'll be taken advantage of way).  So he told me they were cussing he was called a n***** and they threatened to beat him up, and an adult intervened.  But this is the thing, he was more bothered by the curse words than the n-word.  In a way I  realize this is the first time he's heard it as a slur and it doesn't mean much to him.  He was more bothered by s*** and f***.  Idk, I remember the pain of hearing the nword, where he just relays it like they called him stupid or something.  I guess I'm kinda happy that it didn't cut him to the core like it did with me."

Every 2 seconds I swear we put her down and walk out and she’s back out of the crib. She’s a climbing ninja. She shares our bedroom. She doesn’t try to get in our bed or anything. My mom got her a toddler bed but we will be moving her to her sisters room when we transition her to it. I don’t like the hazard the crib tents have although I do realize there’s a hazard for her falling climbing out of the crib. She has fallen twice now trying to get out. Besides that she can get out of the crib no problem. She can also open any door. 

My issue is, with our other 2 kids (11 years before this one) we would switch the lock to their baby proofed room and lock them in. We would go in when they cried too hard for too long and calm them, but then lock it again. (At the time this was recommended by their doctor). My husband doesn’t want to lock her in a dark room. I agree. It’s the only thing that worked for the last two. We end up spending an hour each nap and bedtime with her just putting her back in her crib and shutting the door. Over and over. 

Is there a better way to do this? How can we keep her in her crib, or transition, or avoid locking her in?"

I co-parent with my ex who has narcissist traits, and our relationships has improved ever since I recognized what she was and moved my approach to be more goal oriented and less emotional.  However I recently released that it effected our child (8M) who has started picking up her traits and habits.

Examples taken from a website

Believing they are better than other kids 

See getting attention as their right/need to be center of attention

Withdrawal from others who do not give attention or admiration

Not expressing gratitude to parents or others for being kind 

Excluding other children from their playgroup based on superficial characteristics (they are uncool)

Not taking responsibility for their actions and the consequences

Throwing temper tantrums when criticized 

Resentment at being told what to do

• refusal to listen to authority (teachers, doctors, anyone).

I tried to talk them through it as best i could. The other little boy begged me to not tell his parents. Of course I had to, because I felt like we needed to talk and all be aware of what happened.

DistractedIdealist,2021-04-30 03:55:40+00:00,Do you think it’s worse when your husband yells than when you do?,"My husband and I got into an argument tonight about yelling. We have both acknowledged that yelling isn’t useful in discipline. We both know this, but of course, we slip up time to time. 

When he yells, it’s very primal and intimidating. He’s a bigger guy with a loud, deep voice. He lifts his shoulders up and gets in my 7 yo daughter’s face, sometimes pointing a finger down. She always gets scared, sometimes hides, but always complies. In these cases, I usually tell my husband to calm down and console our daughter. I try to say to my daughter, what he’s saying, in a calmer tone. He finds this so maddening and disrespectful.

When I yell, I don’t have the loudest voice and my daughter doesn’t really get scared of me. My husband rarely intervenes and just lets it be. Sometimes afterward he will tell me I didn’t need to yell about it, I overreacted, etc. 

He thinks it’s bullshit that I get away with yelling and he doesn’t. I always step in to womansplain or whatever it is and he feels like an asshole. I told him I absolutely wouldn’t mind if he stepped in and told me to calm down when I was yelling, but to me, it looks like he doesn’t see it necessary because I’m not intimidating or seem threatening. 

To boil it down; I sense that our daughter feels unsafe when he yells but not for me. My husband thinks I’m being sexist.

Is getting mad at your child automatically sexist because the masculine parent is naturally more intimidating?"

I.am.exhausted. I have a soon to be 1,3,and 5 year old respectively. I am in the midst of potty training the soon to be 3/5 yr old. It has been a constant battle for the last 6 months. I finally threw away my oldest child's pull ups to the diaper monster and they have been running around naked. We potty every 30\~60 minutes roughly. They don't self initial though. I don't get much else done and I am constantly stressed but it's a work in progress! My 3 year old will poop on the potty by themselves (self initiated) and pee but only if pooping. Obviously the baby is still in diapers. So that's potty training!  


My husband works from home from 8\~7 in various hour stretches, sometimes at night and sometimes weekends. It's a schedule that isn't consistent so I feel like Im solo-parenting most of the time. I had a career before I had the baby but I quit to stay at home with the kids because the cost of daycare was more than I was making + pandemic so it just made more sense. Ya'll. IT's SOOOOO tiring. I feel guilty because I get annoyed with my kids, I'm usually sleep deprived, and we struggle to get out because of social distancing at a park near here is almost impossible. My oldest isn't ready for school yet because I'm working on potty training, trying to teach them numbers/ABCs and they have absolutely no interest. (We have been working on the letter C for 2 weeks now). I feel overwhelmed and guilty at the same time. I'm ready for the 5 year old to be in school but it's my fault they're not prepared for it.   


I love them but I miss my own identity. I miss ""me"" and even when I have 5 minutes of ""quiet"" I feel guilty I'm not being productive. On top of that, I miss feeling like more than a mom. I miss my spouse and the non-parental side of this, which then adds more guilt. Obviously, they're my kids, but I always feel like I'm not good enough. There's never enough hours in the day to get things done + meet the needs of my family so house chores usually fall to the side. Kids seem mostly happy, but they constantly want to play. I. DON'T. WANT. TO. I have no interest in playing hide and seek where they run and hide in the same spot. Every time. Literally they just want to be chased and I don't feel like it.  


What do you all do to cope?  


Sincerely,  


\~Tired, not enough mom."

There was an incident a while back, but noting too serious. I want to bring up why having a phone would benefit me. I have a lot of mental problems, such as BPD, anxiety and depression and i have no way to contact friends and reach out to people. Its really hard, because my mom wants me to reach out to kids through the school supplied computer, but i would have to email them and i feel like thats really embarrassing at least to me. I dont wanna make new friends through emails. And not having a phone makes me feel so alone and sad, because I have nothing to do in my spare time and my parents will sit there on there phones talking to people and scrolling on Facebook. My parents tell me to have people over, but I have literally no friends, because I have no way that i feel comfortable enough to use to reach out to people. I need ways to try to convince my parents that I will be safe with a phone and use it correctly. She says they were talking about getting me a phone, but I really think I need to help push that along, because who knows how long that will take. Anything will help, thank you :)"

SnooMuffins6969,2021-04-30 01:15:27+00:00,In need of some advice!!,"A (not so) quick rant! Advice needed!!!!! 

I gave birth to a beautiful &amp; tiny Babygirl in December. She stayed in a the NICU for two days due to sepsis &amp; low birth weight. 

Only a handful of people have met my daughter and I’m very strict with mask wearing, hand washing, sanitizing etc because my baby was born a premie. 

My husbands sister has always treated me like crap because their mom and I had a big argument over me using the washing machine when her other son aka GC needed to use it soon as he saw me loading up my laundry. 

Hubby’s sister had covid around October and continued to party the minute she realized the 14 day quarantine was up. Didn’t bother to retest herself btw. 

I didn’t allow my husband nor his mom to announce the birth of my baby especially to his sister because his siblings were only being nice to me once they found out I was pregnant. I never got a congrats, no one spoke to me unless my husband asked me to clarify anything... y’all know the deal with JUSTNO’s. 

Once we announced on the book of faces that I am home with my baby, hubby’s sister immediately called their mom crying that she was butthurt no one told her about my baby’s birth. She’s VERY obsessed w my baby and has subconsciously admitted that she would like to keep her most of the time as her do over baby. 

She has been begging my hubby to let her carry the baby despite admitting in my face that she goes to department stores EVERY day during her lunch because she gets bored and she works at a local phone store. 

A few weeks after she admitted about going out all the time, she invited us to my MIL house for dinner and I (stupidly) agreed as long as she kept her distance. As soon as we got there, she immediately got up and started greeting my husband and then proceeded to say she was washing her hands so she can grab the baby. I nicely told her that there was no way I’m hell she was getting the PRIVILEGE to hold her and she asked my husband to bring her car seat in so we can put her in there. (why? I have no clue) After I told her the car seat will stay in the car and there was no need to put my daughter in it if I was inside holding her, she lost the happy sparkle of hope in her eye and immediately started pouting and washed her hands anyways to avoid awkwardly walking back to the kitchen. She started touching my baby’s foot and getting WAY to close to us which made me super uncomfortable so I stopped back and walked away. 

Fast forward to my daughters 4 month physical at the doctors. 

My husband texted his brother (the GC) that he wasn’t prepared to see our baby cry when she receives her vaccines. His brother just responded along the lines of that sucks and asked for pictures. 

He then proceeded to ask my husband if he can see her when he surprises their mom on Mother’s Day.... without talking to me about it he told him YES. He then asked if we were gonna let him carry her which my hubby said “sure as long as U wear a mask” this INFURIATED ME because he also made my life a living hell when I lived with them in their parents house and this man also got covid around New Years and kept pestering my husband to let him see and carry the baby.... on New Years. I guess I can give him the “benefit of the doubt” that he “didn’t know” because he told my hubby that he had covid after he traveled back to the state he is currently living in. 

I’m so upset that the same people who took their time to make sure I always felt isolated on holidays or family events all of a sudden want to be a big part of my life JUST because I had their brothers kid. Am I wrong for keeping a grudge? They never apologized, and never will because “they have too much pride” according to my husband. They still don’t talk to me or acknowledge me unless they want to know personal details about me and the baby like “does she breastfeed, how many times does the baby poop” etc 

I don’t want my husbands brother near my baby or me and my husband knew I would be in a vulnerable state of mind the day of my baby’s vaccines so that was the perfect time to tell me he already gave his brother the go ahead to meet and carry my baby. 

How can I talk to him in a mature way that won’t lead to bickering that I simply DON’T want my child to have a relationship with people who hurt me emotionally and psychologically for 3 years straight. Any and all advice is wanted. 

If u read this far... thank u!"
cacme,2021-04-30 01:12:23+00:00,I toured my almost six year old's new school today and had to fight tears throughout.,"Like so many parents, my kiddo's life was absolutely put on hold last March. He was in preschool, excelling, happy and well socialized. Then boom goes the world. Partner and I both lost our fulltime jobs and we all went on lockdown mode. 

Fast forward through the crazy and we made the somewhat desperate decision to pick up and move 400 miles away to an old mountain farmhouse so we could split costs with family and start something new. Our jobs weren't coming back (entertainment industries) and it was that or rapidly run out of money in our old beloved city with very few prospects aside from delivering food. 

So we did the big thing and decided to start a small farm and contracting business to boot. But that left our five year old without his friends, isolated beyond just covid in a rural region where the closest school is literally up hill both ways and a half hour away on the best day. 

We homeschooled. We tried to at least. But between starting a small business, a farm and working part-time and remotely to make ends meet, it hasn't been fair to our dude. He's made huge leaps in math and science and I can't believe how fast he's picking up coding just by playing minecraft on a raspberry pi linux system. But he can't read, at least not fluently. He gets frustrated with the alphabet and writing. And it makes me feel like I'm failing him. 

So, we just enrolled in the far off rural combined school that I was worried would be too white, too behind in academics and too outdated due to its location. I was a privileged, prejudiced nimrod about it, turns out. Even though I always planned to enroll him in school in our new county eventually, I couldn't let go of all the guilt I felt taking away city advantages from him in his education, despite the advantages of growing up on a permaculture farm in a national forest. 

I took kiddo today to turn in paperwork for registration and get a look at the school. The school is brand new. Nestled between rolling hills with a backdrop of the Blue Ridge Mountains and multiple playgrounds, green space and fields to play in. 

I rang the bell and was greeted by the principal no less. He walked me through the paperwork with the front desk admin who told me she knew exactly whose house we now lived in, as she had grown up down the road. 

The principal was planning a fire drill but still found time to give us a tour when kiddo said he wanted to see everything. He showed us every wing, the beautiful gym, the playgrounds, the music room and the magical library. And he even introduced us to kiddo's TWO teachers, in a class of 15 kids average. 

The cake was the lego robotics lab for kiddo. And also the cake was me trying not to cry at not only the excellent display of fine tuned education but also the fact that I was so wrong in my expectations. 

This has been a very long story about how excited I am for my son to go to school in a rural region, and how very prejudiced I still am about rural education coming from an inner city environment. 

I can't wait for kiddos first day, even if we have to be up at dawn to get on the bus. And he can't wait either."

We have tried sticker rewards, bribery, chocolate, candy, praise, modeling, different potty seats and toilets etc etc. I have read all the books. We've done the naked method. Nothing works. On Monday we got rid of the pull ups. They are no longer in the house. The problem is, she wakes up in the morning - she will NOT use the potty - then goes off to daycare. She comes home - she will NOT use the potty - and then goes to sleep and at this point I put a diaper on her for nighttime and she pees at some point during the night. She is capable of holding her pee for hours. She has not pooped in several days since we got rid of the pull ups. She will not poop at daycare. I know she understands what to do and how to do it. I don't understand why she will not do it at home and I am at a complete loss as to what to do."
justastarlight,2021-04-29 23:33:53+00:00,Should I let MIL change diapers?,"So MIL lives with my husband and I. She has been changing my 6 month olds diapers since he was born. At first I had no problems but now I am starting to feel weird about it.

She always changed the diapers of BILs kids and him and his wife has no problem with it. Every time she goes to their house (they have a 2 year old and a couple older kids) she changes their babies and checks them  because supposedly they don't change the babies often and they always have dirty diapers when she comes over there. 

Anyway every time we hand MIL my baby she will check him for pee or poop even if I might have just changed him. If he is crying she will yell from her room ""check the diaper!"" If my baby is just playing contentedly she will check him. I never go too long without changing my baby and he rarely gets rashes

I just let her change him but the thing is I cloth diaper and she never uses them! I only use disposables when all the cloth ones are dirty and I haven't gotten the chance to clean them. I keep the cloth diapers right there and hide the disposables away. But she will go out of her way to grab the disposables even if I always tell her to use the reusable ones! She always complains that they are too hot for him. 

I 
Anyway today particularly annoyed me a lot. I change and feed the baby. Then my husband takes the baby to his mom so that we can eat lunch. She comes back with the baby 15-20 minutes later and askes in Spanish to my husband (since they are Mexican) about the diaper. I reply instead of my husband that I just changed him and he is good. She completely ignores me and procedes to start changing him complaining once again how warm it is! I ask her what happened, did he poop? And she told me no, ""it smells like pee""  and she switches to the disposables again.

I go over and check the diaper she took off and there was very little pee in the diaper! She changed his diaper for no reason. I told my husband and he responded like he usually does when I have concerns about MIL. He tells me it's no big deal. He never sets boundaries with her at all, even when I need privacy and she is violating it. 

I'm thinking about telling her myself to only change him with my permission from now on. BIL and his wife may have no problem with her changing their babies,  but I'm starting to think more boundries are needed. What do you guys think?"
mellie_bellie,2021-04-29 23:29:35+00:00,5yo behavior issues advice please!,"Parenting question on how to steer strong negative behavior back to positive.

5yo boy, really strong emotions.  Doesn't matter what type of emotion it is, the reaction to those emotions are to physically/verbally lash out, whether it's hitting, being destructive, calling people names.  

Yelling is not the way to go to get his attention, it only escalates and then of course, physical punishment (a spank) will not work either, as that would only escalate as well.  

It's gone as far today, as him hitting his grandma with an object, and he's bullying his little brothers (2.5yo boys), and dumped out a whole glass of milk.  I don't know the circumstances that led to these behaviors but I feel like he is trying in some way to get our attention and / or display how he's feeling, but I can't seem to get to the root of the issue to help.  Like - What made him get so upset that he would lash out.  Is it merely because he was spoiled rotten when he was born and an only child, center of attention and now - he has to share w/ his bros?  or are we doing something wrong..??  

I try to be a good example in showing how to express your feelings, setting him aside to take a break from the situation, but it doesn't seem to work.  Trying to explain to him - ""If so and so did this to you, how would you feel"" or ""would you want your brothers to do this to you"" type of thing.

My goal is to:  

1. not shame him - I don't want him to feel shamed or that he is a bad boy; in my heart of hearts, I know he isn't.  He feels really really big and doesn't know how to handle it.

2. come to him with a love and teaching mindset, not parenting with fear.  I mean, to some extent I want him to know not to mess with me as the mom, but - I want him to know, no matter what I love him - I want to teach him the right way for him.

How can I help my boy, any positive, constructive and helpful advice is welcome.  Thank you!"

He can not do much for himself, and my GF has to be right up his butt about taking a shower or brushing his teeth, doing his school work etc. But I suppose that's kind of normal. He is afraid of the dog, he is afraid of the cat he won't leave the room he's in unless the animals are put away.

His parents have enabled him to be eating french fries and ketchup for dinner, or pizza and 6 cans of soda a day, or he will eat a bag of potato chips as a meal. He can not make a sandwich on his own nevermind cook anything.

My GF went to the super market today and returned with like ten bags of potato chips and french fries and just a ton of junk, and I am so angry right now. I know she just wants him to feel cared about for once in his life but I am just so disgusted by his lack of basic skills, or sense of responsibility, humility, and manners.

Body autonomy is a tough thing sometimes.
Regardless the GP is a big supporter of believing a parent if they say something is up with the kid, so ordered the tests.

I packed items to try and distract him, I packed a lollypop. I tried to explain to him that we were seeing a special doctor who needed to look at his blood. 

He couldn't have cared less about it. He WATCHED the needle go in. He didn't squirm. In fact he didn't move. When he saw the blood in the syringe he said (almost excited)  ""wow mummy it's my blood"". Seriously this kid!

ThrowRA99942,2021-04-29 21:37:49+00:00,Concerned about development of girlfriend’s 7 year-old son,"So I’ve been with my girlfriend for over two years and am slightly concerned about the development of her 7 year-old son. I know it’s not my place to say anything (and I won’t), but I do worry about it. 

He’s a great kid, but he doesn’t seem to be able to do things most children his age can do. For instance, he has a very difficult time following simple instructions. Even the simplest instructions he just can’t grasp a lot of the times. We tell him to do two things and he can’t remember the second thing right after we tell him, then he takes five minutes to do the first one (take his clothes off and put them in the basket for a shower). 

Then there’s the school stuff. He struggles with VERY basic math. Sometimes he can’t grasp the concept of subtraction versus addition. We’ll tell him to do a subtraction problem and he tries adding them, and vice-versa. He can do things like adding fives and tens, but if there is any other number, he really struggles. For instance, 4+7. He’ll think about it, and answer with 15. Sometimes something like 6+3 could end up being 4. 

He also really struggles with reading and writing. He’s getting better, but he still has a hard time reading and writing simple sight words.

Then there are other things that I feel a 7 year-old should be able to do. He can’t tie shoes at all, he has no ability to read an analog clock, he can’t do anything to make his own simple breakfast/lunch; making a bowl of cereal/peeling a banana, making a sandwich, etc.

I’ve talked to my girlfriend a little bit about maybe giving him some simple chores to do every day because he has none whatsoever. Occasionally she’ll have him put his toys away, but that’s rare and they’re laying all over the place a majority of the time. She usually says that it’s a good idea, but nothing has ever been implemented. I’ve suggested maybe cleaning the toilet or vacuum, but she says no to those because he wouldn’t be able to do that. 

I know it sounds like I might be overstepping boundaries, but my girlfriend has stated many times that she wants me to be a father figure, so I’m wondering if any of you have any suggestions to maybe help him along?"

What’s the most aggravating is when I try to solve the problem first so I know the answer and then I’m questioned why I did it the way I did it. Because “that’s not how we’re being taught”. And it’ll be a whole week of this convoluted five extra steps to get to the answer. Then they have one day where they teach them the simplest way to solve the problem AND THATS IT!!!  They just move on to the next thing. The simple way is never retained.  So when they get to the next section, and that old material needs to be called back, they do the five extra step version PLUS whatever three new steps they’re learning, and by the time he’s done, his homework assignment looks like a chalkboard in a college level astrophysics class. I don’t know what I’m looking at, but I know the answer isn’t 2 and 2/5. He shouldn’t have to explain three weeks of math class for me know how to find the answer to 1 and 1/5 divided by 1/2. 

They’ve already moved into decimals. I don’t know why they’ve moved back to fractions. They’ve already touched on long division, I don’t know why they’ve moved back to reverse multiplication or whatever he was describing to me last week.

My brother and his fiancee ended up pushing their original wedding date from mid-September 2020.

A few weeks after our wedding, we invited my parents and brother over for a small lunch to announce that a tiny fetus actually crashed our special day. My brother couldn't attend but when we called him to tell him our exciting news, he unknowingly had the phone on speaker and his fiancee heard.

My brother and his fiancee broke up and got back together at least three more times between that day and now because of her outbursts, jealousy and her refusal to seek any sort of help with her mental health issues (which my brother is convinced is bipolar disorder). My poor brother dealt with so much emotional abuse from her but refused to give up on his first serious relationship. It's sad that my brother's, our family's and his friends' reaction to their wedding not taking place as originally scheduled was relief that he wouldn't be tying the knot with her.

Not wanting to see any drama or get annoyed at my brother's then ex-fiancee's adamant COVID denial, I unfollowed her so I wouldn't deal with any unnecessary stress. 

Fast forward to the week that I'm scheduled to be induced,  his on again fiancee messages me, saying how pissed she was at me for announcing my pregnancy on her ""wedding day,"" the original date their wedding was planned for and never took place. I had no idea that the one day my husband who works in health care was off had any significance, and she never mentioned it when she was over for a really nice steak dinner a week after my pregnancy announcement.

I texted my brother a screenshot of her message, blocked her to avoid the unnecessary stress and tried not to take it too seriously. He apologized to me, explained the situation that I was totally unaware of and then let me know that she had a major breakdown because of her jealousy of me and my husband. I was still stressed, and at my doctor's appointment that day, my blood pressure was so high that I was admitted to the hospital. In my hospital bed waiting for my lab results to come back to determine if I needed an emergency c-section (I thankfully didn't), my brother actually asked me to ""just apologize to her,"" which really set me off. I refused to enable someone who couldn't treat me with respect or get help for their own issues.

I am a huge mental health advocate- eight years ago, I was in and out of behavioral health facilities for depression before transitioning to therapy and finding the ideal dose of my current antidepressant. I've cut out as much negativity and drama as possible during my recovery. I've gotten my life completely together, better than I ever could have dreamed, and I never want to go back to that dark time in my life.

Meeting my daughter has been a HUGE privilege for me. I lost half of my body weight to get pregnant, dealt with postnatal depression and early preeclampsia during my pregnancy, labored for over 26 hours then was readmitted to the hospital 1 week postpartum to treat my infected second degree tearing and blood clots. 

Most of my family members have avoided crowds and updated their TDAP vaccine AND received all doses of the COVID-19 vaccine at my request so they could safely snuggle our baby. 

Meanwhile my brother's fiance is still at it with her jealousy, simultaneously reacting with an angry emoji to my sister's selfie with my baby while texting my mother to arrange meeting my baby. Yes, the same baby that she reacted with an angry emoji to online.

I was afraid to even mail back the RSVP for the wedding set for next month to tell them that I couldn't attend their giant wedding during the pandemic because I have my newborn.

My mother wants me to allow my brother's fiancee to meet the baby, simply to ""avoid starting a war"" in our family, but I'm not budging.

I'll let my brother meet his niece while wearing a mask whenever he can get a day off of work, but I refuse to let his unwell, spiteful, COVID-denying fiancee risk my daughter's health, simply because she is throwing a hissy fit.

Wow, that was a lot longer than I anticipated, but I needed to get it all out.

If you read all of this, thank you!

Whether you read this all or not, please, don't let anyone pressure you into doing anything relating to your kids, especially when it risks their health."
galatitravels,2021-04-29 20:59:41+00:00,To have or not to have another kid? PPD and Loss,"Two years ago, I joined this group when I had my first baby at 29. I had particularly rough PPD but it lasted only three months. My symptoms were deep regret. All I wanted to do was undo the baby. I also had a tough time bonding. By the time my daughter was one, I had bonded, was happy and off any anti-depressants. I recovered quickly. We decided on baby 2, because we wanted another kid and also wanted to take a year old mat leave to travel LOL.

Well, our pregnancy led to a late term loss which was very very very very painful. I grieved the first two weeks, then I was hit by what I think is PPD, and once more I had regret that I have a kid at all! Do you face PPD with a loss too?

So weird.... anyways hoping to see if having another baby really adds value or not. I definitely have reconciled with one kid, but our pregnancy was tough with covid, and the loss moreso, not to mention I am again facing PPD with no kid (URGH). 

&amp;#x200B;

SO one kid or two - how can we manage it without being so depressed? We are expats so lack social support - and amidst covid, enjoying parenting is so hard."
BitchinOriginal,2021-04-29 20:48:48+00:00,Social dilemma,"Hello! I’m looking for some advice about how to further approach a certain situation. 
My kids are very well-behaved for the most part. They’re 5 and 7. They’re good about controlling their volume inside and outside, they have great store and restaurant etiquette, and I’ve really made a point about being considerate to others around them. We’re just regular ol’ lower-middle class people so it’s not like they’re nanny-trained or anything special like that. 

We’ve been having some play dates recently with a friend of mine who has another 7yo and the kid has basically no discipline whatsoever. Screams at the top of their lungs in the car, sprints through the store, encourages my kids to do “bad” things even after I’ve told them not to. They even licked my kid and was wiping spit on him... during a global pandemic. My son started mimicking the behavior, obviously, because that’s what kids do but I told him that it was inappropriate and that “we don’t behave like that.” He knows that and tried his best to behave after that. So when the other kid started licking/spitting at him again he spoke up about it instead of retaliating and the other mom told him not to be a tattle tail!! Instead of telling her own kid to stop harassing my son! 

We’re pretty good friends and she’s the only mom-friend that I have at all, so I don’t want to stop these play dates, I just need some advice on how to handle this situation in the future. It’s also the only non-school social interaction my 7yo has and my 5yo isn’t in school yet, so it’s basically the only social interaction she has at all. She told my kid not to be a tattle tail, does that mean I’m allowed to tell her kid to stop doing certain things? I never want to step on anyone’s toes especially about how to parent their child, but this situation is completely out of control. 

Thank you to anyone who answers, I’m not good at navigating this stuff at all."
Tardb00g,2021-04-29 20:41:49+00:00,Toddler told me a daycare teacher hit her.,"Daughter goes to a daycare I’m not proud to admit I actually pay for which started as an emergency solution to a temporary problem. Her last day is tomorrow but I don’t want to have any of the issues I seem to have every day at a place I pay a full mortgage worth for. 

Ask daughter how day went in car. She said she needs a new school. I said why. She says she doesn’t like the playground. Cool. Side-She tells us first thing every night and morning that she doesn’t like the boys at her school because one of them hits her every day and yells at her. (Since being at daycare, she has become increasingly defiant, aggressive, and really does not like going there. Full on fits, asks days she knows she’s not going if she is just to make sure she isn’t etc.) I ask her how she likes the kids at her school. She says she likes them. I ask her how she likes the adults. She says she likes them. But... not Ms Brittany. Who is miss Brittany? Her teacher is sick at home so miss Brittany watched their class for 4 hours today. Why don’t you like miss Brittany? She hits me. Where did she hit you? On the head. We’re there other kids around? Yes. She said it was an accident and she was trying to be nice. Was she holding you or were you moving around? She was holding me. She went like this: lifts her little arm up and brings it down like a hammer. She showed me right on the front of her head behind her hairline. Get home, mom asks and same story, told slightly different. 

My question is, how do I know when to believe my toddler, how do I make sure I’m not leading her towards any answer, mistakenly, and what actions does one take? I’ve been pissed off and desperate to get her out of this place since day 2 for all different sorts of reasons. It’s getting to the point where I am starting to hold this against my partner who picked the place with no research and has kept her in there for 4 weeks despite all the repeated problems I won’t mention here.  Thanks in advance.

ecw324,2021-04-29 20:39:57+00:00,Looking for help/advice with 2 teenage boys,"I want to apologize upfront that this might be a long post. I’m looking for any help or advice from people who are in or have been in a similar situation. I’m just at my wits end and how to best support my wife and family. So here we go...

We are a family of 6, my wife and I, 2 sons (both from a previous relationship my wife was in) and 2 girls (both are biologically ours). The two boys are both almost 17 and 15. Not because we haven’t tried everything, but they do not live with us full time and are only with us every other weekend. When all of the parenting time was figured out my wife was working an off shift job and their dad quit his job to say he was always available. So things have been this way for 12 years I think.  In reality between sports and surprise trips their dad takes them on, we are lucky to see them 30-40 days out of the year. Have they expressed wanting to be at our house more, yes. Have we tried to set that up, yes. Has it ever happened, no. 

Within the last year I would say they have both expressed a lot of anger towards their mom for the way things are currently. So after lots of conversations with us, and like sit for 3-4 hours talking about life, past and future and things like that, we felt pretty good about where they were at. And these were conversations that they wanted to have. We didn’t initiate most of them. I have no problem sitting down and talking with them either. 

Their mom has gone above and beyond to show them how much she cares and loves them. Simple things like just stopping by their dads to drop them off a coffee or going to their school once a week to have lunches with them, or we have done vacations around things they’ve told us they’d like to see or do. I feel like all we have done is shown them love and support. Hell my wife bought them iPhones and we built gaming computers together and even a streaming room that one of them wanted because he wanted to make YouTube videos. It worked out too as they were able to be here quite a bit more during the pandemic.

It was a few months into them being here more we started to notice both of them were saying things that were very sexist, which did not fly with us. We used it as a teaching moment like you need to be careful with what you say because it can come back to bite you in the ass kind of way. They had posted these statements on their tiktok profiles too. So after that anytime we’d ask them to do something like help carry in the groceries, they’d respond with like isn’t that sexist of you to make me carry them in, or hey help me move this because it’s heavy and your mom can’t move it. They’d respond with, isn’t it sexist to say a women isn’t as strong as a man? Just smart ass stuff. 

It was also around this time that we started doing what we called “gym class”. We’d spend 30 minutes doing something active and 60 minutes doing something without electronics. Otherwise they’d sit playing on some form of electronics all day ignoring other tasks that had to be done (chores). They also expected to be served meals when they were hungry because “you are the parent and you are supposed to take care of me and do whatever I ask you to do. You chose to have kids. That’s the deal.” This attitude does not fly with my wife or myself. Our daughters do not have this attitude either. 

Now during all of this we have majorly picked up on narcissistic behaviors from both of them. Their dad is a narcissist and is also very sexist. So because they see this behavior when they are not here, I get why they act this way. We have zero influence on them. And it has now reached a point where we have not seen either of them in almost two months. Their dad never gets us a sports schedule and he took them on spring break without telling us. So on our weekends there has been baseball or basketball happening. And now they don’t respond to our texts or phone calls. They rarely respond to their sisters. Now if they text us and we don’t answer with if 10 minutes they will blow up our phones wanting an answer. But they can’t respond to us. 

My wife is very heartbroken over all of this and now I am getting to the end of my rope with this. I care about how this is affecting my wife, but I’m more concerned about our daughters seeing this behavior and possibly being hurt by their brothers. Both of them very much look up to their brothers. It feels very much like we have to buy and do things for you to get love from you. And they put zero effort into doing things that show they love and care about us, even though they say they do. Like even if they see you struggling with something, they don’t offer help. I don’t feel like they want to have a relationship or out any work into one. They want us to bow down to them and put all the work in to benefit them and screw everyone else.

So what do I do? Do I tell them that if they don’t want to have relationships with us, they need to come tell us to our faces and then you have to deal with the ramifications of that? Or do we just leave them alone and when they feel like coming back around let them do that on their own or what?

Thank you for any form of help you offer."

AssistantDue21,2021-04-29 20:23:19+00:00,Baby Formula,"Hello, my baby just turned 2 months and a week and I have only been feeding her breast milk. I was wondering about formula though. I produce enough milk but I want to start introducing formula just in case of an emergency. I read online that giving a baby under 6 months water, could be harmful. By that I mean that the baby won’t absorb as much nutrients from the breast milk. When making the bottle with formula I use water. I also understand that 2 oz of water is 1 scoop of formula. But what I don’t understand is how do I know that I’m giving her the correct amount of water, because I worry that I may be giving her too much water. I still want to breast feed but slowly want to also give her formula. Also I was wondering if I needed to boil the water or microwave it before mixing the formula and giving it to her?"

PM_ME_UR_YELLOW_LABS,2021-04-29 20:03:27+00:00,Advice on Blending Families with Toddlers,"Hi! 

I’m in kind of an unusual situation and hoping for some outside perspective/ideas.

I am moving in with my girlfriend in a little over a month. There are a few states between us. I should probably mention I’m also a woman. My daughter is 2, and she has a 2 year old boy just a couple weeks older than my kid, and 3 year old twins. My daughter and I have spent a lot of time at her home, even staying as long as a month. The kids all get along really well, and I adore them. It’s chaotic in the best way (most of the time LOL).  

The other day my girlfriend confided in me that she’s worried she won’t be a good enough mom to my daughter.
When she had her twins, she had little to no support, no family in the area, her husband had a hard time understanding or supporting her, and she had horrible PPD. She had a hard time bonding with her babies until they were a little older. Of course that’s understandable and happens a lot, even with singleton newborns. 
She had a much easier time bonding with her 2 year old when he was a baby. He was an easy baby, and it was just him.

I tried to comfort her by telling her I wouldn’t be moving in with her if I didn’t like the way she treated my kid, that my daughter won’t feel like her kid, at least not at first, and that’s okay. It’s going to take time for it to feel like we are a family and not just visiting, and as long as we treat all the kids the same it will all work out. It’s not like she’s going to be mean to my daughter, she’s a lovely person. 

I’m also much more outwardly affectionate than she is. I think she’s worried that will play a role in her ability to bond with my child, since she’s not really touchy feely. I don’t have many worries about her kids because I’m a total softie and I they’ve been really affectionate towards me. Our visits to her house have been during my daughter’s clingy “stranger danger” phase, so she didn’t like being left alone without me. I’m sure that’s having an effect on my girlfriend’s fears. She’s much better now and will definitely adjust, but it was definitely difficult when I wasn’t in the room and she was having a meltdown about it. That would make me feel insecure too if her kids did the same to me every time she left the room. 

Any ideas for helping encourage/support my girlfriend through this and foster a good relationship between the two of them? 

One though I had was that all her kids have these matching stuffed My First Bears and bunnies. Each of her kids has a different color. She bought my daughter bunnies to match her kids, but they don’t make a bear in that color. She once told me that the bears were the only thing that made her twins feel like they were hers in the NICU. I was thinking of buying a bear and dying it to match the bunnies my girlfriend has for my daughter. I thought it might be sweet to send my girlfriend the bear with a “congratulations, it’s a girl!” card and some nice words? Idk if that’s too cheesy or not. 

So hoping others have advice or opinions on how to help my girlfriend feel more confident :) Thank you!"
deeeelightful,2021-04-29 20:00:56+00:00,The preschool down the street does not require kids to wear masks. Is this normal?,"I just checked the place out and it looks pretty good. I asked about covid precautions, and the tour guide said they've implemented extra handwashing and temperature checks. She said they didn't have to add any extra cleaning because they already had very strict cleaning procedures. When I asked about masks she said that they do not require students to wear them, and presented it in a way that made it sound like an impossible thing to reinforce with young kids. I also could see kids playing on the playground, and literally none of them had masks on (and they were older kids, maybe around 7 or 8).      







      







Now I have a lot of experience with young kids (before covid times) and it is surprising to me that she would say this. I feel like young kids are the most likely to follow the rules, and tend to be easiest to reinforce non-negotiable things (like washing hands!). Am I bonkers for thinking this? Or just out of touch with the reality of this new covid world?"

I’ve told the owner about this and he said since I confronted her and that since she gave me the money, he can’t prove she was 100% going to steal it. I ended up quitting my job and walking out mid way through my shift because they had me working with this sneaky manager again. I came back in the next day to turn my shirts in only to find out that the same manager also kept my cash tips from the tables the day I walked out.

flower_chungus,2021-04-29 19:35:58+00:00,Partner is always comparing how I want to raise my child to his upbringing,"(Long post, sorry!)

I'm 39w and going to be induced on Saturday. This will be both of our first child. Partner is 29M and I am 22F. Pregnancy wasn't planned, but very much wanted and loved. 

I was homeschooled my whole life in a very Christian family (so moral standards were super high and religion was taken very seriously). I had 2 brothers (I was the middle child), we are all pretty close in age but I ended up teaching my younger brother stuff like writing and maths. My mother was also very disabled and my Dad was the breadwinner. They have had a rather bumpy marriage that I got way too involved in. I also pretty much put myself through school as resources were limited. I also experienced abuse within my family. My parents are still together and we both have a good relationship with them as I moved out. 

My partner was raised mostly by a single mother who worked a lot, so he has some really grim stories about childcare. She also had some horrible boyfriends who abused my partner as he was growing up. He has a sister that is roughly 10 years younger than him that he had to take a large role in raising. His mother is Christian, but not at all strict about standards. My partner has no strong feelings for religion. He skipped school a lot, started smoking 13 and was dealing weed by 13. 
 We have a good relationship with his mother and see her on a weekly basis. 

So we both come from contrasting backgrounds plus a bit of an age gap. We are strangely similar though as I have left my church and he has mellowed out and we generally get along super well. 

However, whenever we discuss raising our son, he is always comparing things to his upbringing. For example, he smokes, so I've asked him to be really careful round the baby because it can be very harmful and cause cot death. He's agreed to smoke outside, but is very upset about delaying picking the baby up because ""his mum smoked during her pregnancy and in the room with him when he was a baby."" He's also upset because I don't want to see anyone (besides close family) for the first two weeks because ""his mum went back to work within 5 days of having him."" 

When it comes to discussing things like media, religion, money we are pretty much on the same track but when it comes to hygiene, diet and morals we generally clash. He rarely has any other reason for disagreeing other than ""my mum did this or I had to this for my sister. The only things he agrees was wrong with his upbringing was being hit and being shouted/sworn at.

I understand he had a very difficult upbringing and he is more set in his ways than I am, but it bothers me that he doesn't question his upbringing. It was so hard for me to wake up and realise the issues with my childhood and I have really carefully worked to get out of the hole that I was in and become a functioning adult. There are so many things that I am doing differently to my parents. 

Anytime I suggest that we do something different he gets upset like I'm attacking his mother's parenting/implying his mother didn't do a good enough job. 

I am not. I just want him to see that she did her best, but our best isn't going to look like her best. I don't know how to get through to him. He is super excited to be a Dad, has been really supportive throughout the pregnancy and I don't him to lose that enthusiasm. He thinks therapy is useless due to bad experiences when he was young plus it's very expensive.  

I just don't know where to go from here."

amorell0327,2021-04-29 19:03:01+00:00,3 year old night terrors,"My 3.5yo recently started having night terrors (or at least that’s what we think they are). He’s had them almost every night the past 3 weeks. It’s always the same. He wakes up around 2.5hrs after falling asleep. He sits up in bed and starts screeching/yelling/crying. He speaks gibberish and sort of shakes, wiggles around. We just sit with him but don’t try and wake him. We don’t actually do anything, other than make sure he doesn’t leave his bed (he’s never tried). He clearly has no idea we’re there. Then after about 3mins he just lays back down and is silent again. 

It’s really freaking us out! Otherwise his sleep/tiredness doesn’t seem affected. He sleeps from 8:30pm-8am consistently. No naps. Super happy kid otherwise. I stay home with him and there’s been no stress or change of any kind recently. 

Has anyone else’s kid gone through something similar? We’ll definitely bring it up with his pediatrician but I’m just looking for any suggestions or insights. I don’t want to miss something that should’ve looked into. His behavior and happiness otherwise has been totally normal so I don’t feel like it’s actually affecting him negatively right now. It’s more just freaking my husband and I out!"

We have begun the process of potty training our daughter who has just turned two. She is having much success and we’re so proud of her. It has been two weeks and she is quite reliable at letting us know when she needs to go so I am hoping to leave the house a little. 

My plan is to take her on a run using our running buggy, but I am struggling to figure out how to toilet her whilst we are out and about it public. Does she go in the bush? Does she go in the potty? Then what?? I can’t figure out the most elegant solution that meets her needs but doesn’t cause public offence. What did you do?

TL;DR: how do we return to getting out and about without causing a fuss whilst newly potty training?"

I apologize for the length of this post.

***Also if you are replying, please try to be kind. This is not a humble brag post. I am looking for kind discussion and advice. This is not calling out parents with a social media presence, I am wondering how other parents without it manage the pressure! I am super aware that I am privileged beyond belief and that this is something that even bothers me is ridiculous. I am also aware that I sound nuts haha. It's been a long year.***

I am a pastry chef, had a fairly strong social media business presence (for a small city) and ran a successful business at our local farmer's market &amp; from home. 

My mental health took a turn 2 years ago and I was struggling socially. 

I dropped my business, resigned from the market board of directors and started only taking very occasional special orders baked in my home.

A friend strongly suggested I talk to my Dr about anxiety and SURPRISE! I had been functioning my whole life with crushing anxiety and didn't even know it. Long story and a prescription short, and my daily life is so so so much easier. 

Anyway. We've been home for over a year now, our oldest is schooling online and my youngest is a preschooler so we work on that sort of thing through our days. We are an artistic family, are always making/growing/cooking/baking. The kids are sensitive and spirited, they are kind and loving and challenge us every day. We all have outbursts, fights over toys, and sometimes eat buttered noodles for 2 meals in one day. We do our best to guide them gently through the struggles, teach them to believe they are worthy, how to care for themselves, others and their environment. 

My husband and I both manage anxiety. I am a 'type a' person who puts a lot of pressure on myself (I realize this is self-imppsed) to have a clean house, plays with and makes art with my kids, tends to a large garden, cooks and bakes, I don't sit down after dinner until the kitchen is clean, the toys are put away and the bathroom is wiped down etc etc etc. We are also a loving family who are building a strong foundation together. We spend tons of time talking and listening to each other. We both come from families who don't have their shit together. We are doing our best to change that for our kids.

(This makes me sound like I want you to think I'm perfect but I am just trying to get my point across here. I swear like a sailor, love wine, laugh my ass off watching curb, it's always sunny and south park, love horror movies, work very hard on my mental health, smoke the occasional joint, still yell at my kids sometimes, eat McDs and ice cream and am estranged from my brother. I keep it together for my kids. Ha.♡)

Okay, okay I am finally getting to the point! Thank you for staying with me ♡

Here it is: In a world where anxiety is more the norm than not, posting absolutely everything you do/eat/make/feel/how amazing your kid is/parenting skillz are, moms showboating their struggles(this is not the same as getting support online), showing off the super healthy dinner the kids ate, the tea/birthday/sleepover party and the expensive baked goods that went along with it, the matching family pjs, the loving quiet moments between you and your youngest, the latest piece of art/writing/etc your kid made!
and being rewarded socially (online) for doing the basic of things,

My question is this: 

How do I navigate my kids through these inevitable feelings of ""pics or it didn't happen""
How do we gain a feeling of quiet contentment within us, without validation from others? Being happy with not being an influencer, getting likes or views or being a supermommyblogger. 
Just being.... normal!!! 

We all know that there are some days that kick your ass and all you want is for someone to say, ""YOU ARE DOING GREAT"" 
Being an active loving parent/family member can be a thankless job sometimes. We are doing our best in this crazy crazy world and it can be so lonely!

The world is becoming so much more dependent on relationships through social media. We don't live in a bubble. When we deem it age/responsibility appropriate, our kids will have phones. 
I'm not saying I need constant validation. Yet I am human. We need some form of it.  But in a world where it doesn't seem to matter what you do unless it's documented....

Do I even exist?"
abacus_porkrind,2021-04-29 18:00:15+00:00,"My daughter (6) almost referred to a YouTuber as her ""new friend"" and it broke my heart.","I know things are looking up. I know she's not alone; her entire class/cohort/generation will share a version of her experience but it still sucks to see a young life interrupted like this. She was to start kindergarten this year.  I was worried about all the normal stuff, bullying, peer pressure, bad teachers but overall I was very enthusiastic for her to be among people her own age with similar interests, energy levels, etc.  

My two year old daughter is affected too.  Before this, we had a measles outbreak in my area (thanks antivaxers) so she's basically never had an experience of playing in public with other kids. Now the Portland Children's Museum is permanently closed. My oldest loved that place and sobbed for ages when she found out. My youngest had been once. Maybe twice. I guess she can't miss what she never had but the biggest blow was realizing this is likely why she doesn't like to read with her mom and me. 

From around six months my oldest was at the library every week at least. Story times, free range browsing where she could choose armloads of books herself, other wonderful events (we have a great library).  My youngest finally set foot in the library a few weeks ago. She was delighted. But the groundwork isn't done. That rich, fun experience my oldest and I shared never existed for the baby. 

I know ""this too shall pass"" and they're so young this really can be absorbed by later experiences (I hope). I suppose out of everyone, after those who've lost loved ones, I feel sorriest for kids graduating highschool and collage during all this. But it still sucks. 

That's it. No grand insight or anything. Just needed to vent, I guess."

I have to go one by one: Diaper, sippy cup, food, pain, loneliness, overstimulation, etc. She just pushes each thing away and screams harder. She will barely trip, not even fall over, then scream and sit down on the ground then lay on her stomach and scream. I do my best to pick her up, rock her, say ""I'm sorry you're upset. Itll be okay."" Usually she just gets worse. If I ignore it, she gets worse and it hurts my heart to ignore her crying. I just dont know what to do. I really dont know.

My boyfriend called me a few hours ago and voiced his concerns about genetics in children. He noted that I have had an eating disorder, struggles with feelings of depression, and anxiety. He is concerned that this would be passed down to children. 


While I understand and share his concerns, I do not think he has the full picture. 

A few years ago I experienced sexual assault multiple times. It resulted in an eating disorder because I thought if I got a flat chest and a flat ass then I would not be provocative or something. I basically just felt really ashamed and at fault for what happened...so I starved myself. I also was left with feelings of anxiety and depression because...no shit. 


No one in my family has/had an eating disorder, depression, or anxiety disorder. 


My point is that my struggles were environmentally and not genetically caused. 


To be fair, I had never told him about the assault because there never was a good time to bring it up and I felt comfortable around him so I just didn’t wanna think back to it or talk about it. 


What are you guy’s opinions on this situation? He wants to end it but I tried explaining to him and I am really heartbroken.

I’m 16 weeks pregnant and it was planned. However I’ve spent the last 2 months not excited. In fact I’ve been in a deep dark anxiety filled depression hole. I assumed this was due to normal hormones and realizing the loss of my old life, or maybe some depression. However it occurred to me yesterday maybe I don’t actually want this and perhaps I don’t want to be a parent at all. I quickly googled my options and was surprised to feel relieved that I was still able to terminate if I worked quickly. I’ve discussed this with my partner and they are supportive of my choice, and insist it’s my final decision. We used to be committed to a child free lifestyle, then last fall I had a termination. It made me change my mind. I’m wondering if it was too soon after for me to make my choice clearly, or perhaps the influence of leftover hormones. I’m not sure if I’m venting, looking for advice or support, or just wondering if anyone else has gone through the same. Please share your thoughts and experiences with me. Thanks all."

sabeneler,2021-04-29 16:49:11+00:00,Defiance with basic human functions,"I'm officially at my wits end with my 4 y/o. She refuses basic human functions. Everything is a struggle and I dont know what else to try. The one I want to focus on right now is brushing her teeth. 
Context: we have spend thousands of dollars on her teeth already to get them capped and filled due to the 11 cavities she has. Shes 4. All of these cavities developed in the last year (we missed a dental appointment due to covid which I think would have helped avoid this. But such is life).
We attempt to brush twice a day and she refuses. We have bribed, weve put up a chart, we have taken things away, we brush with her, we make it fun, weve tackled her and forced her to. I just dont know what else to try. I cant afford for her to not brush any more. I can't spend any more money on this. 
She doesn't seem to care. She laughs at our frustration, is unmotivated by rewards, and seems undeterred by consequences. I dont like pinning her down and forcing a toothbrush in her mouth, but that's what it has come to for the last couple days. It drives our entire day. It leads to tantrums, it puts all of in the worst of moods. 
Then, after an hour or so sometimes she'll just snap out of it, brush her teeth and all is well. Unphased.

It’s hard to go to college when you have a kid and have to work. Heck, some teen parents even struggle to graduate high school because they have to work during school hours and miss too many classes.

fortheloveofLu,2021-04-29 16:37:28+00:00,Husband thinks I'm trying too hard.,"So, my husband (45M) and I (33F) have been married for 5 years, together for 8. There is a huge age gap, as you can see, and it has an impact regardless of how much we try to not let it have one. Mostly because he has 3 kids with 2 other ex-wives, 17, 22, and 27 years old. Together, we have our son, 13 months old. 

Whenever I try to learn anything, my husband gets either annoyed, condescending, or makes jokes about my personality. Which is quite literal and matter-of-fact. I'm a warm person, I love deeply and wholly but I also LOVE to learn things and share my knowledge. Some would call me a know it all, I would say I just want people to know what I know (I realize that can be annoying). But, I love to know FACTS and reality, up-to-date ways to do things differently. 

My husband...is the exact opposite. He knows everything already and hates to be told new ways of doing things, by me in particular. That's not to say he doesn't learn new things, he just only does it when he wants to do something in particular like fix something or build something. Otherwise, he rolls his eyes or just stops listening. 

Why is this in the parenting sub? I'm getting there.

When I say he knows everything, this includes how to parent our son. I'm a current full time SAHM (and Master's student, and former Chemist for about 8 years) so I literally dedicate my entire day to my son--learning stuff every day, gathering data (not literally, just giving the idea of how I am) about him and spending what time that I used to be running experiments, now handling the growth and development of our son. 150% all in.

But when problems arise, like transitioning from bottle to sippy/straw/open cup, and I try to talk to my husband about my struggles, he gets upset because he thinks I'm reinventing the wheel by looking up how to teach open cup to a 13mo. I have since given up open cup learning because it was such a big deal between my husband and I. 

I try to explain that onesie pajamas pretty much only come in tight cotton or loose fleece because of fire hazards and he thinks, since fleece is hot as fuck and we run hot at night (as people, not the house, which stays at like 68ish), using tight pajamas is bad, despite my reading that loose non-fire retardant clothing is dangerous. 

My husband refuses to let him go to bed without a bottle despite me knowing from research, and the doc this time, that it's unnecessary at this point. 

With his older kids, he was never around. He's been in the military actively or as a civilian contractor his entire adult life and with that meant going overseas. His oldest was the only one he raised himself and that was almost 30 years ago--shit has changed and updated. 

I bought, albeit probably too many, things to help make life easier throughout the newborn stage. To my husband, they were pointless. But my research 🤓 told me they were useful. And generally, I was right.

My husband is also bipolar. He goes through stages of extreme happiness and then extreme sadness. Happy stage is ""buy whatever you think we need"" I'll be over here obsessing about this new project or new talent I'm trying to master,"" sad stage is ""what the fuck did you get a nose suction tube for? Or a giant flower for the sink? Or what the fuck do we have so many bottles?! I'll be over here thinking my life sucks, my kids hate me, and I'm now extremely unmotivated.""

We get along great, enjoy the same things like going outside, hiking, video games, etc. We have the same parenting views, for the most part, but not all. I tried Ferber, he got worried and felt bad for our son but let me stick to it and now our son sleeps well most of the time (knock on 🪵). Before Ferber, I insisted on complete darkness for naps and he thought I was being dumb but our son slept like shit and I was frantically trying to figure out what to do. Consulted internet experts and he thought that was dumb. But he also had no idea so not sure what the fuck there. I tried to stop rocking our son to sleep because I learned that it could be a crutch  and he thought I was being dumb (it was a crutch and made Ferber that much harder). 

There is so much more that has become less and less because I've just started giving in or not talking about the moves I make during the day.

TLDR I don't appreciate feeling like I'm putting 150% into raising our son and my partner thinking I'm overthinking or doing things that he thinks is stupid or unworthy."

Northstar_8,2021-04-29 16:11:00+00:00,Questions for parents with children in daycare.,"Long post! 

My 13 month old just started daycare 2 weeks ago. She has been home with my husband her whole life due to covid but he is ready to go back to work. Before she even started daycare I had several issues with the Director of the facility being unorganized, not communicating well, forgetful etc. however I chalked it up to me setting my expectations too high. 

The daycare has video cameras so I can watch my daughter any time which is wonderful but I am seeing very concerning things happening but I’m not sure if I am just being too high maintenance or if this is typical behavior for daycare centers.

Some things I’ve noticed are there are no engaging activities like their website stated they do on a daily basis. The only thing I’ve seen them do “activity wise” is fill a ziplock bag with water and let the kids play with that for a good 10 min. Surprise my daughter bit the plastic bag and they took it from her but didn’t give her anything else to play with.

They allow other children out of their high chairs when they are finished eating and the kids will come to my daughters food and start eating from her plate when she’s still eating, drink from her sippy cup and the teachers do nothing. 

I watched my daughter climb ontop of a stack of cots which had to have been about 4 feet high and she sat up there for a good 2 minutes before attempting to launch herself off head first, thankfully someone finally caught her before she could fall but obviously no one was watching her the whole time. 

Yesterday she came home with a cut and bruise right in the corner of her eye and I was never notified any accidents occurred, they “didn’t see” it happen so we don’t know how hard she was hit or with what. They are supposed to be following up later today about it. 

They send her home completely filthy, clothes covered in food, milk and who knows what else. I had to wipe yogurt out from her ear the other day. 

Teachers will blow their nose and not wash their hands and immediately go touch the children or serve them food. Absolutely disgusting.I’ve also brought this up and I was told they would address it but nothings changed.

The director constantly states they are severely understaffed which does not make me feel any better about what is all going on it makes me feel like they don’t have the resources to properly care for the children. 

I’d like some input from other parents if this stuff happens at other daycares and I’m just being too high maintenance or if I need to find another place for her to go. Childcare is very hard to find right now where I live so I don’t want to pull her out unless absolutely necessary. I also don’t want to leave her there waiting for something horrible to happen. Thanks!"

HappyAsHappyCanBe89,2021-04-29 14:45:56+00:00,Any advice please - How to stop overthinking and getting emotional?,"Hi all. I've just joined this sub. I've been active on other subs. 



I'm a 32 year old mother to a lovely 4 year old boy. He will be 5 this year. It's looking very likely that my son is on the autisic spectrum. He shows some red flags but not an overwhelming amount. Diagnosis is imminent (he's been getting assessed for over 2 years). He is mostly non verbal (3 words) but his understanding and social skills are good (social skills slightly lacking). 




We currently have help in the form of a private speech therapist and this is helping a lot. She guides me on the best activities and interaction to carry out with my son and she also praises me (I know that sounds stupid but sometimes when you don't get a thank you or an I love you from your child, someone telling you you're doing great is a big boost). 




I have a really strong bond with my son. He is my only child and will be my only child. He also has a strong bond with his dad (my husband). We are family of 3 with a cat and we are for the most part, very happy. 




One thing that is making me unhappy is my overthinking and worry. When I'm playing with my son and doing everyday things, I'm in the moment and it's all great. When night time or alone time rolls around though, I just become overwhelmed with worry about the future for him. Will he talk, will he make friends, will he be independent as an adult etc. Sometimes it leads to me looking through photo albums of pictires of him and crying. I bounce back of course but I feel this is a very negative thing that I do. I have recently started to worry about when I pass away and so does my husband, who will be there for him. Thinking about him alone breaks my heart. 




It probably doesn't help that my wider family is dysfunctional. I have a great relationship with my mum, stepdad and sister 1. However I have no relationship with my dad and sisters 2 and 3. This is mutual, my mum, stepdad and sister 1 don't have a relationship with my dad and sister 2 and 3. Let's just say there's some personality disorders or something going on with those 3 and maintaining a relationship is impossible. This is relevant because my husband is an only child and most of the cousins are mothered by sister 2 and 3 so I feel at some point, my son will have no one. This is very irrational isn't it? Does anyone have any advice about how I can stop my mind going there? Live is for living right? My son will only be young once. Whilst these thoughts and worries don't affect my parenting or quality time with my son, it affects me. 




It's also came to light recently that I suffer from a medical condition (an allergy condition) and testing has resulted in me now being allergic to several things (I never had any allergies before) and I'll need to be on medication and carry an auto injector for the rest of my life and a couple of these allergies are unavoidable and severe but can be controlled with medication hopefully. It doesn't impact my general health now I have medication but it makes me think that I could one day have a severe reaction and not make it (unlikely but by now you tell overthink!). 




Sorry for the rambling guys. Does anyone have any advice for me? I currently take 1 St John's wort daily which helps a lot. I think it's more my emotions I need to get a hold of. I feel lately I cry (on my own when no one else is around) more often than is normal. 



Thank you very much for reading."

(Dad is captain, grandmother, her SO) Our son has fun with it but its not his passion like it is for them. When he does practice it is because he is forced. We spend every single Sunday at the pool hall for league and now he goes twice a week during the week given no option. My husband and I disagree and of course his mother and her boyfriend also agree with him. If he doesn't play to get better, win, and to do cash tournaments then he will not be allowed to play at all.

After this initial discussion, his twin volunteered to cook for him because he really likes cooking, but I forbade him to be sole cooker as he already helps out more at home, I said he could teach him how to cook and then they can alternate who is cooking because he can't rely on another person making meals for him, this only got him even more annoyed saying ""If he likes to cook, I should just let him cook for both"" and stormed off. 
In this situation, what  you guys think is the best solution?"
Getsome4000,2021-04-29 13:09:40+00:00,So my son let himself out in a thunderstorm in the middle of the night...,"Our son is 4 and has been waking up in the night and coming out of his room lately. Up to now it has mostly been just him popping in our bedroom or like drawing himself a bath or something but this morning after him up and down all night, etc. I see a pile of his PJs and his night diaper in front of the backdoor. I asked him and he stripped down naked and let himself out in the thunderstorm at like 4 AM!!!!??!? 

I flipped. Probably more than necessary but I was freaked out and didn't know how to convey the severity of the importance of - at minimum - staying in the house at night and def when it's raining. Which leads me to my question: How do we effectively combat this without mentally messing him up? I know that locking him in his room for bed is a fire hazard as well as not great for him psychologically but dutch doors are a no-go because he would climb that easy as can be. Any advice/tips are appreciated thanks if you got this far!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - 4 Y/O gets out of bed at night, takes off jammies and lets himself into the backyard during a thunderstorm around like 4 in the morning - no lock/dutch doors as those are easily defeated"

The last couple of days he has been soooo clingy so I am not able to get any cleaning or anything done (he's crawling and always under my feet) and he just isn't sleeping, usually he takes a 2-3 hour nap around noon and he won't lay down but is crabby and tired all day, and just won't stop crying. He usually sleeps 12ish hours at night, and now hes sleeping considerably less. I suspected he is teething and gave him tylenol but it didn't help at all. The sleep thing wouldn't be such a big deal if he wasn't actually tired but he shows all of HIS specific signs that he is (he shakes his head back and forth, rubs his eyes, yawning, and then the dangerous one is he just throws his head around and doesn't care if he hits it on something until of course after the fact and he's hurt himself, I've asked the doc about this and seeing if maybe we can get him tested for something, because autism runs in my husband's family  but it's too early). He woke up at 5:30 this morning and I am not a morning person and he was just screaming in his crib, I tried to wait to see if he would lay down because I knew he wasn't hungry because he had been fed only 2 hours prior at 3am, so I watched on the baby monitor until about 6 and then went in there and was extremely aggravated and yelling (not like screaming or anything just like raised my voice a bit) and I've been getting so aggravated like this the last couple of days and I just feel horrible about it. My husband and I tried for so long and went through multiple losses to have my baby and I always thought I was meant to be a mom, but now I'm not so sure. I'm terrified of being like my mom, she was unnurturing and unloving and I don't want to be like that, but I just don't think I'm as cut out for this as I thought and I feel absolutely horrible for it. I honestly just needed somewhere to post this and get it off my chest..."
MissTiffanieAnne,2021-04-29 12:41:37+00:00,At the end of my rope with 10 year old,"He is constantly lying. Like, daily. I literally just busted him first thing in the morning, saying he had cereal when he didn't. He put milk and water in a bowl. Why?
It's little things. He went through an elaborate setup the other day to fake making a sandwich instead of just eating bread. I wouldn't have been mad if he said he just had bread; the fact that he thinks he can get away with this stuff is infuriating. It's getting to the point where I don't want to talk to him because it becomes a game of ""find the truth in the lies"". 
He's destructive as well. He's been grounded from everything for a while because he keeps making bad decisions. I guess boredom caused him to peel the paint off his wall. I get it, I would probably be mad and bored too but really? It's not a cheap fix. 
I had to sacrifice my school laptop and set it up so he can only access school websites. Idk why school-provided chromebooks aren't set up that way. He was getting into websites he definitely should not have been. He's doing better but still lying about completing his work. Again I get that it is the end of the year and we are all low on motivation. Just do the stuff and get it over with. He has nothing else to do since he's constantly grounded. 
My other child is a Saint in comparison. Complains sometimes, but does her work and doesn't lie. Idk what I've done wrong with him but it's beyond frustrating. If he's acting like this now, idk what will happen when he's a teen. 
I'm taking him to therapy starting next week. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to help ease the pain and frustration from these situations? He tells me he lies to avoid getting in trouble, but it takes more time to construct these lies than it would take to just do what he's supposed to. I'm really at a loss and any advice would help."

We had an incident a couple months ago where he choked on a puff. He was just beginning to put food into his mouth and having fun with it. He has not even attempted eating since that day! 

I’ve tried everything to get him to eat puffs and Cheerios. I’ve resorted to putting it into his mouth, between his teeth so he’ll chew it, or attempt to. He pukes every time food enters his mouth. Not with puréed baby food. He’ll eat that 3 times a day, reluctantly. He tries to dodge every bite unless it’s something he really likes. I’ve tried giving him a variety of different foods and he just becomes more and more upset. It’s almost like he has a phobia when it comes to food. He’s very interested in what I’m eating so I try to give him bites and he turns his head every time. So I hand him bites sometimes. He observes it then drops it and moves on. 

I asked his doctor what to do, he was no help. He said he would probably be eating in the next couple months. He said that last time... he said he may need speech therapy to learn how to eat but I don’t think I can afford it. I think he’s just scared of puking because so far that’s what always happens when he eats anything. 

Anyone else had this problem or is familiar with speech therapy in toddlers? Any solutions are much appreciated!"

acity4ever,2021-04-29 11:03:25+00:00,Baby feeding help,"TLDR: my baby (2.5 months, girl) hasn't had a good latch while breastfeeding and cannot pull from a bottle.  Advice appreciated on how we can prove latching and bottle pulling.

In the hospital after birth, someone said my baby had a good latch on my wife.  Can't remember if that was the lactation person or just a regular nurse...   Anyways we have had major issues getting her on the bottle - she refuses to suck on it.  She'll just play a bit and get frustrated.  Tried different temperatures, different people, wife leaving the house, different bottles and nipples (6 different bottles), tried different positions, tried bouncing, etc...  Baby doesn't like to suck from a finger and won't take a pacifier.

Saw a lactation specialist Tuesday and they said it's a poor latch and also they think she has a high palate.  She said the baby is only getting the foremilk from breasts and no hindmilk because she hasn't been pulling much if at all.  She's really only getting the letdown.  This explains why she feeds so often still (like once an hour).  She will sleep for like 3 or 4 hours at night one time but then be up every hour to feed cause she's hungry cause she gets enough to last her that long apparently. We made an appointment for next Tuesday with a speech specialist who apparently can help with latch and also an ENT doctor in a few weeks.  

We are using a 10mL feeding syringe to get some hindmilk into baby for now... Also have tried a small medicine cup and that seems like it could work (tried it once).  But I'd like to see latch improvement and bottle pulls improvement ideally.  Is that feasible now and how?"
dextermorgansnanny,2021-04-29 10:26:13+00:00,Send prayers.,"Don’t use my story for anything. Period. 

Y’all say a prayer or send good vibes. My family member called me Monday night to ask if i could keep her youngest who’s three. He’s got serious “i don’t like to listen issues” and i asked if i could take one of the other siblings because it’s WAY easier to put him to bed and keep an eye on him at night if i do. I’ve got a 5 month old myself. Well. Siblings had school so i couldn’t have one of them. 

He went to bed about seven thirty and screamed for his iPad for TWO hours. I’m talking holy crap devil inside me screaming but the issue is our internet was having and area outage so he just had to deal
With it. I woke up about six and he was in the livingroom. I assumed he’d just gotten up. Nope. I just now woke up again (second night with me) at four thirty, went out there to check on him in our middles room (they’re at moms) and he’s sitting on my couch. He’s been up god knows how long. I put him back to bed screaming, kicking and crying again. 

His behavior is just through the roof bad and i have kept her older two for years with no issues. I’ve never met a kid who was able to stress me out this much. I’m laying in bed right now crying because during the day it’s constant attention seeking behavior from him.  

His mom was an amazing mom up until last year when her husband found out she was having an affair. It came out that she was likely suffering severe ppd and mental health issues (she’s aware this is no excuse and that’s not what this post is about.) and it was triggered by the birth of her youngest (this kid.)

Since then she’s been sort of absent and her 14 year old has taken over as pseudo mother because their dad travels for work. Like my cousin is home, just not present. It breaks my heart for this kid because when he’s sweet he’s so good. But my god. My nerves are absolutely shot, my usually neat house is a WRECK, and my own kid seems to be in the worst mood because of the constant screaming and kicking. Last night my insanely calm baby had an absolute meltdown until i took her out of my house. My dogs hide. My boyfriend lets me handle the kid and it got so bad that even he said something to him about his behavior in an attempt to correct it and give me a break. 

I love him but he needs so much more attention at home. I cannot keep him until this behavior breaks. I am literally counting down the seconds until his mom comes to get him. I feel so fucking bad about it too."

This is a letter to all of those planning to have kids one day but are still living a life kids-free: 

Dear person with all the time in the world.
I recommend that you take some extra time and enjoy your peaceful beautiful life! I recommend that you take a loooong shower, use some body scrub while you listen to your favourite music or even better, that 1 hour long podcast about how to focus and better your mental health! Also really just enjoy that you can go to the bathroom at any time you want and need. Invite some friends for dinner later and cook ANYTHING you’d like! Spicy food, a lot of onions (!!!), all kinds of veggies that you like and get your favorite wine, get two or three bottles so you have enough to drink some of it while cooking in PEACE! Enjoy an uninterrupted dinner with your friends and discuss the content of the podcast you listened to earlier and enjoy the fact that all your attention is on this one specific topic that you are discussing as these free human beings you all are. And don’t worry if it gets late, you have all the time in the world to sleep in tomorrow only to be woken up by birds singing outside your window at 11AM!!!
When your guests leave then take your time cleaning up or maybe just leave it for tomorrow cause you have all the time in the world and I kind of feel like you should be enjoying it more than you actually are! 

That’s it from me. If some of you have something you want to add to this letter feel free !!"

After rapid weight loss and lots of testing, we found out a few weeks ago that he has cancer.

It’s been tough on everyone knowing that he’s so sick, especially my mom. She made the decision to have him euthanized tomorrow, as it’s clear he is slowing down and now losing muscle tone. Friends and family have been over to visit my parents and say their goodbyes because he is such a beloved companion. Both of my children love him as we visit frequently and he makes visits to our house too. 

I have been lucky so far not to have a death in the family since my oldest (4M) has been able to understand and recognize a person/beings absence in his life. I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to kindly and gently bring it up that the dog won’t be around anymore. I’d love to be as honest with him as possible, and I have an idea of what I’d say, though I worry because he’s a sensitive kid. How should I begin this conversation with my son?

Platina4k,2021-04-29 07:11:13+00:00,Playground advise for very sociable kid,"Since our kindergarden is closed at the moment and for the foreseeable future, my son longs for social contacs his age. All we can do is go to playgrounds, when they are not too full. 

Now he is very sociable and we taught him our understanding of playground manners. Like ""the playground belongs to everyone"", ""we wait until its our turn"" or ""if you want to play with others' toys, ask first"".

But sometimes they are groups of kids, who play very differently and mean. When he approaches them and asks to take a turn or play together, he gets a ""no"" or even gets shooed away. Which of course upsets him, even though he can take a no for an answer without being totally out of it.

The only explanation and teaching I can think of in such situations is to tell him to except that and play on his own. Or we play together instead. But he picks up these behavior of course. And I wonder, how I can teach him to be more self sustaining. He always seems to take this kind of rejection to heart and wonders, what might be the reason others don't want to play with him.

What do you say to your kids in such situations and make them feel they are worthy of friendship and kindness? I would like him to be resilient to such experiences."

Hasn’t been to school for a few days now due to the panic.

However, her dad thinks that at this age, I should give her more slack because she’s too young to understand. I on the other hand think he’s too soft and cannot discipline or direct her properly. He gets irritated when I tell her no a bit too firmly, like yesterday when she was throwing food all over the couch he accused me of “yelling” when I tried to stop her. I just told her a firm no and took the plate away from her. Recently, she started to throw a fit about brushing her teeth, which tonight resulted in me brushing her teeth while she layer on the bathroom floor throwing a tantrum. Her dad was upset about it, saying she’s not even two years old and doesn’t understand why she needs to brush her teeth. For me that’s exactly the reason why I wouldn’t compromise on that - she doesn’t understand that it’s important in a first place! So am I being too harsh? Or dad is too soft?

She likes to admire mine (I just wears studs, nothing fancy). Personally I'm not a fan of babies with earrings, because they didn't choose that. I got my ears pierced when I was 7ish, then repierced plus secondary piercings when I was 10ish after the other holes closed up. I don't want to sound braggy, but our kid is awesome with needles (last time she got her blood drawn she didn't even flinch or make a peep), and she's super smart. So I think if she knew not to pull on the earrings, she'd be gentle with them. Any thoughts on if this is an okay or a terrible idea?"
KingdomOfDirt,2021-04-29 00:20:11+00:00,Twins hit each other when they *think* they are alone.,"Twins are three soon to be four. Smart and sassy! They don't hit each other when people are around but as soon as they think they have the privacy they will go all WW3 on each other. 

So, obviously, they know it's frowned upon because they only do it when they think they have privacy. I have a nanny cam and sometimes they'll tattle on each other so that's how I know. (They are aware of the nanny cam, it's not hidden but they don't really acknowledge it as ME watching even though I've flat out told them) 

Any suggestions for how to teach them not to do that as a way to solve inter-personal arguments or should I just let it slide?"

tealambert,2021-04-29 00:03:22+00:00,Too old to believe in the tooth fairy?,"My 10 year old daughter came home today with questions about the tooth fairy and I’m a little upset. Obviously I knew this day would come, but I always figured it would be some other kid who burst her bubble. Instead, she tells me it was her teacher. Apparently her teacher used the tooth fairy as an example of a myth. 

It just bother me that her teacher used the tooth fairy as an example. It seems to me, there could be hundreds of other things she could have used. After the last year our kids have had, couldn’t they just have a little bit longer in believing in the magic? Is it reasonable to tell a class full of 9-10 year olds that the tooth fairy, and subsequently Santa, Easter bunny, etc, are myths?"

We are slowly inching towards more normal. We are allowing some activities. My 15 year old dances and is back to in person but only goes twice a week. That is his only face-to-face gathering with people outside of our house. We are allowing them to hang out with friends as long as it is outside. This weekend my 14 year old spent the day at the park with friends and came back to our house to play basketball with some friends after. My 9 year old is having outdoor playdates and is going to a birthday party this weekend. The 15 year old has always been on the more introverted side but we are going on a year now of him being in school online. Is this kind of isolation something to worry about?

He sometimes gets so distracted by the things he sees he forgets he's being fed.  He has been trying to talk for months, even audibly saying ""hi"" at 6 months.

He's ten months old now and the ""Hi""s are gone, he used to babble, but thats mostly stopped, at 9 months he even started sayong ""dada"" ""bubba""(his nickname) and ""chicken""(pronounced ""ticken"").  All that has stopped too. We used to reliably get him to repeat the words he was picking up if we said them a couple times. Example: ""bubbabubbabubba"" would get a response of ""bababababa"" now we get no verbal response, though he still turns and smiles.

On occasion he does seem to replicate sounds. Yesterday he looked at me wide eyed and said ""oooooooh"" when I said ""woooah"" which I got him to repeat a few times, but we have recordings of him saying ""hi"" clear as a bell from 4 months ago which we always positively responded to; smiling, laughing, saying hi back, talking to him more, etc. So the fact that he seems to almost ""forget"" is a bit alien to us.

This is our first child, so we're definitely learning as we go.  I'm trying to convince myself and my wife that this is just a phase within his learning process, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried he was regressing somehow.

Does anyone have any insight?

Thanks in advance"

LuckyBunny0908,2021-04-28 22:37:11+00:00,I’m at my wits end with 6 year olds attitude.,"My six year old is smart and clever and well rounded socially. But she has an attitude I cannot believe. I think I do well taking most things with a grain of salt but to me this is getting out of hand. Not long ago she told me while she was angry that I “loved her brother more than her”. While I know kids say things in anger, I did try to hear her and acknowledge her feelings. So I set aside some time to make it all about her. I reassured her, paid more attention to how I interact with both of them and set aside activities and time devoted to her completely.

 But her behavior has not improved. Any type of discipline or even just telling her what to do results in eye rolling, silent treatment, stomping, crying or her snapping at me. I have tried discussing with her using her words, the purpose of responsibility, the dynamic of me being a parent and helping her learn to be independent, etc. But emotionally I’m so drained I could cry. I feel like I can’t discipline her with any purpose because she just shuts down. Like she isn’t learning anything. If I implement consequences she will have a fit. But even just telling her it’s her turn to take a bath first will result in a night of silent treatment and glares.

I know deep down I should ignore it, but it is exhausting to be treated so bad and feel like I’m not teaching her anything. 

Her dad says she responds better to softer tones and “asking rather than telling” her to do something. But I think it does her a disservice to coddle her. 

My family says it’s a “girl thing” but my two sisters were terrors and that’s all I see when I look at her behavior. I just need advice"
AngelHoneyGoldfish,2021-04-28 22:09:39+00:00,2yo is having a hard time adjusting to new sis and being away from her daddy. Advice?,"A little background so that you get the whole picture:

My husband and I just had our 2nd daughter in March. We did everything we could to prepare our 2yo (baby doll, books about being a big sister, talking to her about it, taking her to ultrasound apts, etc) but she has had a very hard time adjusting. She definitely showed regression in the first month:  refusing naps, nightmares, screaming and other attention seeking behaviors that I had never seen before. Besides the nightmares, her bedtime routine and night sleep hasn’t changed. She’s a great nighttime sleeper.

Now keep in mind, for the last month, I have been spending more time with the baby and my husband has been spending more time with our 2yo because I am constantly nursing, but I do give her 1 on 1 time as much as possible. This has been difficult for her to see mom give the baby so much attention, but she also enjoys the time with her dad because she’s always been a daddy’s girl.

5 days ago, my husband returned to work. For those 5 days, my daughter hasn’t refused her naps and has overall been pretty good and back to normal. Today was my husband’s first day back off from work and our daughter is back to refusing her naps and acting out. During nap time, she cries for her daddy. He has tried reading to her, rubbing her back until she’s calm, and laying on the floor by her bed until she falls asleep. No luck. 

It seems like she has separation anxiety from her daddy?  She doesn’t act like this when he leaves for work but acts like this when he is home. What can we do to help her and support her?  I feel so bad for the stress my little girl is feeling."

Being that I'm in Victoria as is 10+ other family members in my boy's life, I'm biased.

I'd still like to know... **What are YOUR thoughts on raising a child in a small city vs a small town?**

Personally, I love Victoria for many reasons, one of which is that it's a city with many academic and career opportunities BUT it's still not a ""big city"". It has a small town feel to it and plenty of nature in and around it.  

I've been to Courtenay multiple times and while I love the nature there too, I'm not so sure if it will provide the same opportunities for children who grow up there.

Plus, I've read recent (last year or two) reports that say Courtenay is the most dangerous place to live in BC and 7th most dangerous in Canada.

It has a Crime Severity Index (CSI) of 119 vs the average in Canada of 70."

To start I’m (30f) and currently 8 months pregnant. I live in a pretty close knit community, and since becoming pregnant I’ve made a plethora of friends (they used to be acquaintances, but since getting pregnant apparently that means I’m “worthy” of their friendship I guess) I actually like the upswing in friends because making friends is hard as you get older, and most of them have young children/toddlers/babies, or are actually pregnant themselves, so it could be good socialization for my daughter, and things to do this summer. 

One mom has a “mommy blog” via Instagram that’s filled with spreading disinformation. I’m not at all anti-vaxx and I believe in modern medicine/science. She’s constantly sending me bogus links that have no reliable sources, and is constantly badgering me about having a hospital birth.  I don’t know if everyone in the “mommy group” feels the same, or just doesn’t say anything but maybe since I’m younger and pregnant she feels like taking me under her wing or something? 

Anyway my MIL is actually a ER physician, this girl either chooses to ignore that and still spread her dislike for modern medicine. My thing is should I bother saying something? Tell her to “back off” and risk losing the new friendship, or just let her continue? How would one handle this? I also don’t want my baby to get sick in the future because her child I’m willing to bet isn’t vaccinated, any tips from a seasoned parent?

Today at lunch he didn't want anything I offered him and it turned into a tantrum. I decided to sit down on the floor with his food and take a bite. My son noticed and came to sit with me and started eating his applesauce because I had taken a bite. We then moved on to raspberries where I would take a bite out of one and he would finish it. I even got him to eat a few pieces of sandwich before he decided he really didn't like the sandwich. This is the first time in months I've seen him eat raspberries! It's almost impossible to get him to try even a bite usually but he just sat and took turns eating little bits with me. It was such a relief to make some progress!"

I can see the response already about telling her straight and boundaries, but ladies and gents, those work for people who RESPECT boundaries. As much as she can be a delight to be around 'mother knows best' with this woman sometimes. We agree on some parenting aspects and are polar opposite on others.

I had a traumatic birth with PTSD, mix in that I have trust issues and anxiety, the idea of another makes me freeze up. Not to mention that I got laid off due to covid and now working self-employed to help with bills, using our second bedroom as an office, we're tight on money and space.

She's been hinting at 'we should have another for a year now' and more or less came out and said it when they popped round last weekend. We shot it down with 'we have no money 

but... I know this woman, she's going to give us financial advice next time we meet to persuade us, I know it. This is what she does. You say no, she doubles down. When she can't convince us both, she'll pull my husband aside and try and convince him. If I give my 2 cents, especially with parenting tactics that differ, we'll be undermined and spoken to like children that need to be instructed. This happened in all topics! Conform!

My husband has learnt to fake compliance and go his own way when they're not looking, something I've adopted just for them since they HOUND you to conform. 

It's funny because my own mother who can be a bit emotional manipulative I have great boundaries with, if she crosses the line, I tell her. She pouts but we're good in a day or two. We have a better relationship now than we did in my teens. I feel we've grown to respect each other as adults and just wish we could that with my in law's."
usernametaken4times,2021-04-28 20:53:37+00:00,Our very taciturn (but lovely) daughter,"Long. Thanks for reading!

I need help with my four year old daughter. Just for the background - I also have a 2 year old son and my daughter was a preemie born at 25 weeks. She did well in the NICU and overall doing okay. Both me and my husband work full time from home. 

I have the following concerns. We feel that my daughter is somewhat behind on emotional development.

She screams for everything that doesn't go her way, which means multiple times a day. We have been patient, tried to talk to her during calm times but we haven't made any progress. It is not crying but a loud scream for every small thing that doesn't go her way. She attends a preschool and doesn't talk about her preschool or about her with us. The teacher says she is a quiet kid and even at home, she doesn't share anything that happened in school. Even if we ask her questions, she doesn't want to discuss that. I feel I am not able to connect to her. We also don't have any family close as we are immigrants. I feel her behaviour and her not able to share things with us are related? 


We have tried speech evaluation at our school district but assessing her vocabulary she doesn't qualify for a therapy. Are there any therapies available to help a situation like this? What do we need to do better as a parent to connect with her? Please show us some path! Thanks!"
onwardnow,2021-04-28 20:49:33+00:00,"Teenage son (16M) addicted to video games/screens now has ""headaches"" &amp; does nothing","Backstory:  Son 16M always loved gaming.  His older sister bought him a PS4 several years as a gift and he had an iPhone for several years too.  Wasn't really a problem until last year before the pandemic started.  Then he started missing school because he wasn't feeling well, was hard to wake up, seemed moody, etc.  We finally figured out that it was because he wasn't going to bed at a good time, staying up late playing games or watching stuff on his phone.  Grades started to suffer as a result too.  The pandemic hit and he pretty much gave up on school for the rest of the semester, only doing the bare minimum.  Summer came &amp; we didn't change things up too much.  His mother &amp; I  are divorced and he spends part of the week with me and part of the week with her.  

In the fall, we decided to keep him home &amp; do homeschooling because of the pandemic.  That only lasted a month or so before he fell back on his old habits.  I grounded him from his PS4 &amp; Switch.  His iPhone had broken by this point so he didn't have a cellphone any longer.  We had been working with a therapist for my grandson so we talked to her about my son.  She suggested that he start earning back his privileges but he had to admit to what caused the loss of his privileges and come up with ways to earn them back.  He refused.  I have shared custody with my ex-wife.  She thought I was too strict and only went along with the grounding from video games.  While he is with her, she was still letting him watch TV.  And he was the one that was manipulating her into letting him stay home from school for the most part.  He missed the most school when he was with her and barely missed when he was with me.  

After that start of the New Year, he claimed he had a headache that never went away.  That made it to where he couldn't do any schoolwork at all, so he claims.  Took him to doctors &amp; a headache specialist and didn't find anything medically wrong.  Started prescribing some meds to try to get rid of the headaches but nothing has really worked (or so he claims).  Mostly still on a messed up sleep schedule despite us telling him he needed to try to go to bed at a decent time, etc.  I just found out that he's been sneaking video games by playing on a Gameboy he had (that I forgot about).  Because he's been getting away with that, that's why I figured he didn't care to earn back his screen time.  

Now I'm also suspect about his headaches.  Whether he actually has them or if they are as bad as he says they are.  He refuses to go to therapy.  I mean, right now, he pretty much has gotten his way.  He does zero schoolwork, watches TV at his mom's, and apparently now has been been playing gameboy when he's over here, and just sleeping weird hours.  

Because of the lying and hiding his habit, or just finding another ""fix"", I'm afraid that he'll just find something else to do once I take his gameboy away.  And forcing him to keep his door open, only allowing him in his room to sleep, etc, is that really going to solve anything?  Just looking for ideas on how to deal with this.  His mom thinks I'm too strict and also suffers from chronic pain herself, so she tends to go easier on him.  And as a result, he would just rather stay with her than come over to my place when I'm supposed to have him.  

I don't know if he's too prideful or ashamed to admit when he's messed up.  And that's why he refuses to talk to someone else or even try to earn his screen privileges back.  He also feels he's treated unfairly because his older brother had way more freedom in that we didn't regulate his screen use as much, but he was getting good grades, working a job, and having extracurriculars.  I've told my son that he would have the same freedom but he would have to show me he could be responsible too.  And clearly his addiction to screens was affecting the rest of his life.  

Is it time for even more hard love and more punishments/monitoring?  I can monitor him when I'm awake but all bets are off when I'm in bed or when he's over at his mom's.  We've tried to get him to do other things with us but he refuses for the most part."

caroline_,2021-04-28 20:04:21+00:00,Bath time mischief 😩,"Hello, obviously I know this problem is extremely bottom tier but please humor me. My kids (4.5y boy, 21m girl) go absolutely nuts at bath time and it drives me and their dad a little crazy. My daughter has seen her brother do everything from slurping water to sucking on washcloths to chewing on rubber toys or plastic balls and so she does it too. My anxiety is mainly that she'll end up choking on something (AND frankly I'm grossed out by them drinking the water they're bathing in). We've managed to get my son to stop a lot of that, but it's next to impossible to get the toddler to follow suit (obviously!). 

I just want a calmer bath time routine. Half the time my son starts the mischief but then gets upset when the baby takes it too far and splashes him in the face repeatedly (or something). 

I'm wondering if other parents here have found themselves overwhelmed by the mischief and chaos your children cause during bath time and if you've found strategies for it? Orrrr this is my life for as long as I've got two kids sharing a bath?

My thing was, I had moved back in recently because my business fell apart, went through bankruptcy, then found out my taxes are fkd where I owe 10x more than I even made, and THEN one of my closest friends screwing me over for $160k+ because he knows I cant afford a lawyer (bc of taxes situation) and then laughing about it to our mutual friends. 

I was broken. I didn't know where to go. Going to my parents was the worst thing I did. I thought my habits that were built up at the time, and the fact that even tho all this BS was happening, I was in the best mental physical and emotional state of my life (this was before friend issue). 

I didn't realize how bad things were here and I fell apart even more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent god knows how many hours trying to talk my bro and sis into seeing the consequences their choices will have, but they just did that dead eye'd knod, and went back to gaming again the next day. 

My sisters actually evolved. She straight up told me she doesn't care anymore. 

I even opened up to how I started balding because of the stress Im going through and how Im starting meds because of it. She spends like $250+/mo on shit to put in her hair, dye it or all these lotions that she doesn't even use half the time or what ever. 

I sacrificed so much and she told me she just doesn't care. 

I went through the shit she's going through and worse (my parents are a former shell of what they used to be) and I realized that her and my brother are not the type to listen. They'll learn from their own mistakes. 

It really hurts watching this because I can see its just few little tweaks we can implement that can turn everything around, but instead my parents zone out in front of the TV when ever they're ""Free"" (my mom I can't even blame her bc she does a lot of the cooking and cleaning too) and they have so many health problems because they dont even go for walks or take care of themselves at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing my parents parents, made me understand how they came to be. Then seeing my brother and sister, and me having lived on my own for a bit, made everything clear.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't seem to get through and help them. 

I cant afford to waste any more of my time on them at least not form here. I think once I move out again, become financially stable, I can get my parents a chef and a cleaning lady, and help in that manner, but I cant physically be this invested in them anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im not sure if this is the right place to post but I wanted to know how I could be less effected by the actions of my brother and sister and basically my family, so at least I can focus on fixing my own life. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

Guardian to my brother and sister since my teens. 

My brother and sister don't want to change nor care.

How do I let them go in a manner where I can at least focus on fixing my own life because its beyond a mess. 

I can help them once I fix my own life in other ways instead of being there physically, just hire a personal trainer / cook / cleaning person or stuff like that. 

They spend 60+hrs a week on gaming, my sister I think is at a point where she only sleeps during online school and games rest of the time or is on tiktok (last time I checked her screen time on her phone was 15hrs). Its like no wonder the rest of their lives are falling apart they dont do anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did it in my early 20s where I was just over it and focused on myself, I got in shape, built a business, moved out, and felt happiness for the first time ever. Now I feel guilty because I had made it and felt so happy while my family was struggling in the way they are now. 

The issue is though, they CHOOSE to suffer, they don't care or at least wont make an actual effort to change. My mom being the exception. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I distance myself a bit, at least till I can move out?"
Active-Sheepherder-5,2021-04-28 19:32:48+00:00,Son is late to everything on purpose,"I have an almost 3rd grader who is purposely late for things. It's a new phase that I think is borne from a need for control, but it's getting irritating. Especially for me because being late stresses me out. He'll be ready for school but he'll just sit there until the bell rings then leaves so he can be there late. He's doing this during school too, his teacher tells me he is purposely waiting until he's late for recess or library or whatever activity. I've asked the school to penalize him when he's late (in an age-appropriate way of course), which they didn't do before, but beyond that and conversations about being respectful of others' time I'm out of ideas here.

A bit more context: He's not depressed or avoiding activities he doesn't like, he's pretty honest about the fact that he's trying to be late but has no actual reason for why. He says he likes it. He has a lot of control over other things, like what he wears and colors he puts in his hair, etc. etc. I can't/won't react or yell or force him to get ready or do whatever because it doesn't work so I try to let him experience the consequences himself, though there really aren't any. How do you explain the importance of punctuality when there are no consequences for being late?? I've considered being purposefully late for things that are important to him so he can understand why it's inconsiderate but that petty revengeful stuff just isn't my style.

I mean, it's really not that big of a deal at this age but it's becoming a habit and not the short-lived phase I thought it would be. I'm not ""worried"" per se, more curious about how other people have handled this sort of behavior."
Moosar96,2021-04-28 19:28:10+00:00,Getting full custody of my daughter,"Hello Internet! 
I live in Tennessee. I plan on cutting ties entirely with my ex boyfriend, the father of my daughter. A LOT has gone into this decision, I’ll elaborate below and include a smaller TLDR at the bottom. I’m just really hoping that you all can give me some more advice or insight as to what I can expect or prepare for. 

My daughter is 3. Her father is not on the birth certificate (no father is listed) and we were never married. 
He is turning 31 this year, lives with his parents, and has never held a job for longer than a year. (He’s only had roughly 4 jobs, ever) he was recently fired from his job and has been consistently dishonest about his employment and ability to provide support for our daughter. He does give me $150 bi-weekly and he has her every Friday night - Sunday morning.  

We broke up January of 2020. While things have been civil for the most part, he has been consistently shady and unreliable. He will often complain of money trouble, and having a lot on his plate, to postpone child support and move visitation. 
We currently do not have any court orders (visitation, child support, parenting plan, etc) but his step mom gave him $2500 for a lawyer in February 2020 to pay for a lawyer. This lawyer said that would be the only money he would have to pay as long as everything remains uncontested. 
We were able to agree on a parenting plan but the court date to finalize has been pushed back numerous times due to covid. 

I have worked VERY hard to separate myself from my history/relationship with him in order to facilitate a healthy co-parenting relationship. 
But upon healing and growing I’ve decided that I am not comfortable with him being in her life at all. 

For anonymity, we will call my daughters father W. 

I met W when I was 13 going on 14, he was my best friends older brother. He groomed me for a year. Playing “games” and “teaching” me how I was supposed to behave for boys. I vividly remember the silent treatment that he gave me when I was to nervous to “put out” on his 21st birthday. When I eventually “gave in” things quickly fizzled and he no longer spoke to me. 

We didn’t speak for 6ish years. At a very rough point in my life he just so happened to reach out to me and we reconnected. 
At first it really appeared that maybe he had left me all those years before because of age but now that I was older everything would be okay. I moved in with him and his family and ended up pregnant within that first 6 months.

While I lived with him I learned lots of really concerning things about him. 
-he had been using a secondary app on his phone to save every snapchat that I sent to him without my knowledge. These images and conversations were stored on a flash drive, I am not the only girl on this flash drive. 
-he had a secondary Snapchat account that he would log in and out of depending on who he was talking to. 
-he had access to a “one drive” filled with NSFW images of girls from our hometown and surrounding counties, most I knew to be underage 
-he used an app called live.me, he explained to me that if you went to this account -&gt; this follower -&gt; the accounts that THEY follow are underage girls who are likely to expose themselves
-he has *undiagnosed* dissociative identity disorder. 5 additional personalities, with names and ages, boys and girls
-before he turned 18, probably during his sophomore or junior year of high school, he was accused of *something* with one of his little sisters friends. This was taken to court but the only outcome that I know for sure was that he had to attend court mandated therapy which how only completed the minimum before moving to a different county. 

I feel like some of this sounds too crazy to believe and why on earth would I stay. 
I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing by trying to help him be better, and staying with my father’s daughter. 
He regularly belittled me and had me convinced that I couldn’t make it on my own. He would use Snapchat to track my phone anytime I was a work or shop or occasionally out with friends. He would go through my phone whenever he could. 

As I mentioned above, I work very hard to separate myself from our past in efforts for our daughter. But he is consistently dishonest and sketchy. I am really concerned for her future. He truly has a history or predatory behavior and if something were to happen to her or one of her friends I don’t know what I would do. I have only ever brought this to his attention once. He threatened to fight me in court, tooth and nail, to change her last name to his when I told him no. I told him that if he wanted to turn this in to a court battle we should probably be really thorough and address the beginning of of relationship and his mental health. After 15 minutes he called me back, told me that he didn’t want to fight and asked me to promise to never tell anyone what he did. 

As I’ve started to address and heal from my trauma, I’ve started to see things in a different light. Him wanting me to make that promise solidified that he did something wrong, that I wasn’t just crazy. 

I have my own apartment now and I don’t have any assistance outside of what little he provides. It doesn’t make or break me when it comes to finances. I’ve fortunate to have a good job and have kept a good savings fund. 

I’ve talked to a paralegal and she assured me that due to the BC and never being marriage, I can pull the plug right now with zero repercussion. He will have to petition he court for parentage/legitimatization before he has any rights whatsoever, at which point he will have to go through DNA and prove fit as a parent as well. 

Going forward I will only be communicating with him via text or email so that everything said can be recorded. 

If you’ve made it this far. I appreciate your ears, or eyes, so much. I’m just really wanting advice? Peace of mind? Any warnings or insights of things I should be prepared for? To scream into the void? 

Okay I’m done now. 
Thanks all. 

TLDR: My daughters father has exhibited extremely predatory behavior, he groomed and sexually assaulted me when I was 14, he is consistently dishonest and unreliable, claims to have multiple personalities, and lives with his parents. I’ve decided to cut ties entirely to protect my daughter and her future friends. I’ve spoken with a paralegal, and will be proceeding with only text/email communication. 
Seeking any advice and insights the internet’s has to offer."

We have always known she was small and she always has been. (I'm only 5 foot so I assumed That she gets it from me). But people have been commenting lately about her being very small and so now I'm slightly concerned. I. Gonna talk to a health visitor about her height. She has no other health problems. Does anyone else have any similar experiences of have a very short child?

SBanks52,2021-04-28 18:28:30+00:00,How do you take 1 year old out for the day? (What about naps)?,"First time mom here and have basically been quarantined her whole life. I’m getting ready to start taking her places like to an outdoor winery/brewery for a couple hours or whatever, but what do you do about nap time? Her schedule is:

7 am wake up
8am bottle
9am breakfast
10am-12 nap
12-1 bottle and lunch 
3-4 pm nap
4- bottle
5- dinner
7- begin bedtime routine

So basically the 3-4pm nap is gonna be hard to swing. Do they usually just fall asleep in the stroller? Just let her sleep in the car on the way home after keeping her awake a little past usual nap time?

Sorry this all may sound so simple and dumb but it’s been weird basically never leaving our house with her so she’s created her own schedule she really sticks to it well."
Out-of-Stimpacks,2021-04-28 18:15:21+00:00,I was told I’m “wasting my time and talent” by being a stay at home Dad,"r/daddit seemed to relate to my story, so I thought you guys might like it too


I went to get my second COVID shot at the VA this week. The nurse was making small talk and asked what I did for a living, and what did I do in the military. I explained that I’d been an Army combat medic in Afghanistan, and that now I’m a stay at home dad. She was horrified!! Why haven’t you gone to nursing school?!? You’re wasting your life this way! Don’t you want your daughters to have a reason to be proud of you??
I politely agreed and endured the awkwardness washing over me til she was done. But now that it’s too late to tell her off: look lady. First of all, my daughters are not a waste of time. The younger is almost 2y, a developmentally critical age. The older is 10y with high functioning autism. She struggles socially and needs all the help she can get. I bust my ass from the minute I roll out of bed to the minute I crawl back in at night. Besides which, I’m rated 100% disabled with PTSD. Obviously medical settings are a huge trigger and I have no interest in fighting off panic attacks 70 hours a week the rest of my working life. I made the choice I wanted to be a professional dad and I stand by it. End rant.

I was wondering what other parents thoughts were on this. Sometimes when my daughter won’t put her pyjamas on, or is having a tantrum.   When I’m not around my wife will leave the room and shut the door. My daughter asks for her to come back.

To me it seems as though it could damage her and is the wrong way to get her to do something. What are everyone’s thoughts?"

zzstop123,2021-04-28 17:29:56+00:00,How do you leave a partner if you have no job or money for daycare?,"My partner and I both suffer from C-PTSD. While I've been actively working with a therapist, he started then stopped going because the co-pays were way too high (I have state insurance; he has horrible insurance through his work with insanely high deductibles and copays). 

He freaks out at me on a regular basis in front of our kids. Claiming he is my ""caretaker"", how much I've traumatized him over the years and now he's built up so much hate and resentment he can't let it go, etc. Due to chronic health problems and a baby that doesn't sleep, I find myself needing him to take over sometimes on weekends so I can sleep. It is literally a matter of life and death at times. So he'll go all in, burn himself out to a crisp and not say a word, then unleash on me every horrible thing he can possibly conjure. He throws things, kicks things, he goes full on lunatic and nothing will stop him.

Obviously this takes a toll on our kids. He's beyond stressed and overwhelmed and we have no family willing to help (even for a couple hours once in a while) and we cannot afford to pay anyone. We are forced into survival mode, just chronically in fight/flight mode 24/7.

I stay at home, in part, because anything I'd make income-wise would be close to what we'd pay a daycare, anyway. So. How tf would I be able to leave? I have no family. No money. We aren't married. How would I get a job and pay for daycare to be able to leave in the first place????"

Im_bored77,2021-04-28 17:10:02+00:00,How to deal with bad behavior from cousins influencing my toddler!?,"My child is a few months short of 2! Her cousin is 2 already. She isn’t the greatest with sharing, always wanting to withhold all toys from my daughter. When my daughter tries to play, my niece yells out “mine! Mine” her parents just stand there. My daughter repeated it and I instantly shot it down, in front of them... saying “that’s NOT a nice word. we only share. There is no mine.”
My daughter never had this word in her vocabulary. I’ve now had to stop her from saying it a few different times. Both at home and with her cousin. 
Every time we see their kid I feel like it’s a step backwards because she’s reminded of the “me, mine” mentality. 
Since I’ve scolded my own daughter before for repeating their daughter (right in front of them), i figured they’d try to encourage my niece to stop saying it too. Nope. Just let their kid sit there shouting “mine! Mine” at my daughter whenever she wants to play with her. My daughter isn’t even 2 yet and she points to her cousin and calls her mean. 
I’m seriously about to lose it on these people! Do I just start telling my niece that is NOT nice IN FRONT of her own parents!? It’s severely ticking me off that they literally don’t try to stop her bad behavior. I’m hesitant on Seeing them now, scared my daughter is going to come home with a different perspective on sharing/ fairness. Advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you so much!"

I was walking by a market stall today, and I saw two children play while their mom was busy buying stuff. The older one (4M) was busy dragging a small cart away from his brother (1.5M), who was getting more and more upset and finally started to cry with anger. It was clear that the older kid didn't want the cart (it was one of those toys small toddlers use to walk), he was just slowly pushing it out of his brother's reach, all the while looking at his brother and smiling at the other child increasingly upset reaction. In the end, he deliberately wedged in a tight spot, so his brother wouldn't be able to move it, and walked away. The younger child tried and fail to get his toy and broke down completely, as the older child smiled with glee. As I said, the mom didn't see, and I'm not suggesting this is abnormal behaviour or anything. I'm just curious: is this just random pettiness, or is there some developmental reason behind this kind of stuff? Thanks!"

The other kids have specifically told her this and I have heard it come from their mouths myself. Specifically; ""My mum said we cant be friends because youre white.""

Shes one of the 3 Caucasian children in her class, everyone else is a mix of other races however a lot of them are also related to each other being cousins and such. 
She tells me she gets picked on in class and during breaks so she stays inside with the teachers and goes to lunch time clubs. 
She has also told me they bully her for the food she eats, I like to think I make her lunchbox look cool and give her healthy food which also looks good and appealing for her since looks and texture are a big thing for her. But now this explains why for the past week she hasnt eaten anything from her lunchbox until she gets home. 

I dont know what to do. I was severely bullied my entire school career, i have few friends and poor social skills because of it and no matter who I told the bullying got worse because i told someone or just nothing changed and no one helped. 
Ive explained that none of this is her fault but i dont know what else to do. 
If i step in will I make this worse for her? Do we look at different schooling options?"
lkwoycmv385,2021-04-28 16:19:04+00:00,Pinworm tips?,"Hi all,

I'm hoping you parents can help me as a non parent! I think I had pinworms, not sure where from, but had some bad itching and irritation and finally just took the pyrantel meds. It made me feel way better and I think I saw a dead couple in my stool. So, looking for tips. I live alone but am assuming I got them from my friend's kids...

Yesterday, I took the meds and deep cleaned my place. Vaccuumed. Then wet mopped. Dusted. Cloroxed all surfaces, handles, tables, books, anything I touched. I put all my clothes in a garbage bag and washed on hot. Stripped my bed, washed it all on hot and dried hot. I even tossed my laundry hamper. I showered, but on tight spandex under pajama pants for bed. Woke up, vaccumed again, recleaned the bathroom after use, showered on hot and used soap. I wash my hands and under my nails after I use the bathroom and before I eat.

Any tips of not having them come back? Am I doing enough? Do I need to take a second dose of meds? The box says one is enough.

Do I need to wash bedding every day? I plan to just change pillowcases daily. If I'm fully dressed for bed, is there still a risk of them spreading back to me?

Also, when I shower, I literally soap up my butt and stick a soapy finger up my asshole (gross i know) and wiggle it around. will that get rid of the eggs on there? I then wash my hands with antibacterial soap and wash my labia with feminine wash.

EDIT: I also don't think I scratch over night? I wear spandex and tight pants with a waistband that I tie tight. I wrap myself up in a blanket with my arms out of it. I wash my hands after waking up and clorox anything I touched on the way."

It is her best friend from her kindergarten class that invited her for her bday. I have met her mom twice at bday parties of other kids but never been to their home but it’s only a mile away from us. I plan to come inside and talk to both parents before leaving her for the night just to make sure it’s safe. She really wants to go and has begged for a sleepover for months but with covid people weren’t having them(almost all adults are fully vaccinated in my area so we are doing more now). Anyways Is this to young? Should I let her go? I know at her age I had sleepovers all the time but the early 90s were a bit different then now.

The result is that, when I tell her ""no"" (even on trivial matters), she breaks down and has a fit. Any advice is appreciated!"
nicole11930,2021-04-28 15:19:49+00:00,Road trip suggestions!,"We are going on a very long road trip this summer. First, to a small lake town for vacation, then to visit our (vaccinated) families that we haven't seen in 2 years. We have a 10 yo, 7 yo, and a baby who will have just turned one. We will also have our 2 dogs. We plan to drive 10 hours, stop for a night (a hotel with a pool to get a bit of exercise) another 10 hours, stop for a day/night at grandparents, then 10 hours to the lake. We'll be there for almost 2 weeks, them drive 10 hours to see family for another 2ish weeks, before doing the 20 hour drive home (we'll stop for a night halfway).

Obviously this is going to be a little bit painful. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips that might make it easier? We have a minivan, and the 10yo will be right next to the baby, so she can help pass her toys and everything. The two older kids are great travelers, and will have their paperwhites and nintendo switches. I'm mostly concerned about keeping a newly mobile baby still for so long. Should we try to do a lot of nighttime driving? The baby has never had any screen time, but we may end up letting her use a kindle if we get desperate enough. What would a one year old even watch/play on a tablet? Would passing her back a new toy every couple of hours help? Are there any crayons that would be safe at this age? It's been a long time since we've traveled with a baby this age! 

We aren't doing this until the end of June so I have lots of time to prepare. The goal is for the drive to be as fun as possible; we've been stuck here for over a year so we have lots of lost time to make up for. Any suggestions are much appreciated!!"

I live in a suburb of Chicago, so not a small town, not that it makes a huge difference but definitely not a place where you know everyone and you can keep your doors unlocked.

Turned off the water and found that the tank of the porcelain toilet was spilt down the middle. Neither of the boys had any idea of how that happened in their sleep. They each were adamant that it must have been the other that broke the toilet.  

So, I mentioned that I could borrow a polygraph machine “from my friend in the FBI” to find out who was telling the truth.  After much discussion, we administered the test last night. It turns out that my blood pressure cuff was a pretty convincing test.  They boys were pissed when they found it was not a real polygraph.  

It was a great ruse, but these boys are tough to crack. Oh well, replacing the toilet today.  We still have no idea how it broke in the middle of the night."

I am a father myself and couldn't even imagine what he is going through. I knew how to support him immediately but now that it's been a day I am looking for any advice about what else I can do?

BlackMoonLilith23,2021-04-28 13:51:07+00:00,I need feedback on yesterday’s altercation,"I told my 15 year old son that if he didn’t get on the bus &amp; go to school, I would lock him out of the house for the day.  
I said it out of anger.  
He was being defiant, he said he just didn’t want to go.  He was supposed to go back in person a week ago, and I let him stay virtual bc he was stressed that he got behind on his school work.   I contacted his teachers last week asking them to not call on him in class until he is caught up. 

I would never lock my kids out of the house.  I have found making threats in the past to get him to go to school.   So I tried it again.  
Then  I told him he could work in the garage office for the day on his chromebook, but not stay in his bedroom and do school on his gaming computer. 

He refused to go out to the garage office so I said I’d call the police to get him out.  Again, It was a threat, and I realize I shouldn’t have done it.    I dialed but hung up as soon as he said we was going out. 

He called his dad crying saying I locked him out.  I never locked the doors.  And I made him coffee and a bagel and went out to the driveway to soften my tone and try to reason with him. 

I know my approach was wrong.  It’s “worked” in the past, but at what expense?  
He said I was scaring him.  
Now my soon to be ex husband has written a letter from his attorney to mine saying he’s concerned for the children.   I have a good relationship with all 3 of them.  Once in a blue moon when I see blatantly disrespectful behavior, I become a “yeller”. Angry.   I guess there is a trigger point in there that needs healed."

My son is a bit of a picky eater. He does eat some veggies and he likes most fruit. But he also likes a lot of high carb foods. I'm having an issue with his diet at his moms. She feeds him a lot of high sugar foods. yesterday he told me his mom puts sugar on his celery! This makes it even harder to feed him healthy food when I have him. 

I'm afraid if I push too hard, he will just stop eating at my house and wait until he is at his moms. He is 6 and he's a big kid. Structurally big, although I feel he is also overweight.

nataliajossu,2021-04-28 13:26:13+00:00,Signs of ADHD?,"My daughter likes my good friend’s family. They have twin boys, only 6 months younger than my daughter (she’s 3 this July). However, I find them a bit troublesome as they tend to hit each other, and my child ends up being hit too sometimes if we the adults don’t prevent it in time. We have to be cautious and be prepared to stop a violent act when someone looks like they’re about to attack. Sometimes the boys will grab her cheeks quite violently, hit her with some toys, and also pull her hair and she’s cried because of it. Some days they’re more calm &amp; that makes my child happier to play with them. At some point she didn’t wanna see them for a while but now that they played again recently I still notice that they still like to hurt others (the boys also tend to do this on each other). My child doesn’t hit back. She’s often just stunned. Their parents feel bad about it. They’re very active boys, they like to get on the dining table so quick &amp; jump on it. They’re still on sippy cups (a phase my child skipped) and if they see a cup with water in it they flip it. Sometimes they flip their plates full of food too. The parents don’t seem mad and just clean it up. That’s something my child wouldn’t do on purpose, and even if she spills something she likes to clean it before I even notice. I feel like the twins can’t contain their excitement and they lash it out with violence. Or is it because they’re boys &amp; there’s two of them? I just notice a lot of behaviors that my child, nor my nieces have done (I helped raise them since babies). I know that kids are different but I’m worried it’s signs of ADHD but I don’t wanna hurt my friend’s feelings by asking her to get the boys examined."

Deafisnotdumb,2021-04-28 12:51:50+00:00,Son stresses himself over grades/sports and I don't know how to help him.,"My youngest is in 10th grade and is 15. He is a good kid but stresses himself out so much about school and sports. He is determined to graduate valedictorian so any little slip up is crushing to him. He is taking AP and honors courses and works himself so hard. His school has switched between virtual, hybrid, and in person and right now they are in person. His stress levels are higher now than they were when he was virtual. He waa freaking out last night because he has a test today and the material they learned on Monday is going to be on the test when he originally thought it wasn't going to be. 

It also happens in sports. He plays hockey in the winter and his coach once said that he isn't the best on the team but no one outworks my son. Now it is tennis season and this is a sport my son excels at. His coach believes he has a chance to play Division 1 in college. The amount of effort he puts in to perfecting his game worries me. 

He is a great kid but so stressed out. I am afraid of him burning out. My oldest was a great student but made time for herself and enjoyed high school. My middle could stand to put in a little more effort himself but he does well and doesn't stress grades. My husband and I are not focused on grades and never have been. We are not pushy crazy parents. I don't know what I can do to help him."
page456,2021-04-28 12:51:00+00:00,What to say to kids about toxic people you cut off?,"Figured I’d try a shorter question. My husband and I aren’t in contact with my mom or his aunt as they’ve been pretty cruel to me in the past and this repeat behavior comes with no warrant, no explanation and zero acknowledgment of their “mistakes” or an apology or attempt to do better.

I believe they’re both semi evil and sick women but that’s a story for another day. 

With help from our marriage counselor we’ve set up boundaries and since these women don’t care to say sorry or improve, we are basically NC.. turns out passive aggressive and narcissist people will actually NC themselves practically when you stand your ground and they refuse to acknowledge how crappy they’ve been. Seems they rather die than say sorry or just be nice.

My husband is mad because I’ve been put in awkward situations where my 5 and 7 year old (mostly 7 year old) have not understood a situation or what’s going on and I basically had to tell my oldest (about each toxic person)” So and so isn’t nice to mommy. They don’t want to talk about it or say sorry so we are on a timeout/break now.” 

To me this is a child friendly way of telling them. In a few more years I’m going to be a lot more Frank. My husband says he doesn’t like children thinking they’re entitled to adult issues or that they think they can put adults on timeouts and got mad and said “How about I tell them the same about your mom that you did with my aunt?” I said “I’ve already told them. I don’t sweep things under the rug..” and quite frankly it upsets me that I’m the one mistreated and yet expected to continue to protect the reputation of two nasty women who have brought a ton of grief to my life. I spent a lifetime doing that and everyone thought I was crazy (because I was losing my kind being treated poorly and covering up because “we don’t tell others family business” and “blood is forever”) and how I’m done.

I want my kids to enjoy their childhoods but I absolutely plan on telling them everything about my dysfunctional parents and why they aren’t in contact along with other relatives. I’ve had enough of people treating me poorly and then covering up for them.

Am I wrong? My husband doesn’t know what he’d say when I ask what we say then.. his reply is he doesn’t know or to not say anything and keep the kids out of this. 

Any suggestions or stories of your own? Feedback?"

Many of my peers are grandparents several times over already and I’m still fighting with lazy, fresh teens to get out of bed and get to school. They think of me as a doddering old fool.

Spoiledwife77,2021-04-28 12:33:41+00:00,My son got some life lessons yesterday,"So my son graduated from HS last year amid all the covid crap. He didn’t take drivers Ed in school because we couldn’t afford it so he used some of the money he got from graduation to pay for his online driving course. He got a job pretty soon after and between me and my mom we have been getting back and forth to work. Now I worried that he would struggle with work since he has squirrel syndrome aka adhd . He has never been officially diagnosed but I have friends that say he has several symptoms. 

Let me tell you that boy exceeded all our expectations! He is a damn good worker and even impressed his boss to the point they gave him a 2$ raise after 6 months. Got another 1$ for getting forklift certified. He used his first tax return and some of his stimulus and we helped him buy a car. I have been letting him drive to work (I’m with him) to get him some driving experience. After a long ass time the dmv was finally taking appointments for the driving portion of the test.

We set up an appointment for last Tuesday. We get there and they ask if he watched this particular video , he says no cause we didn’t know anything about it. So they get him all registered and he pre-pays and he schedules another appointment for yesterday. We are on our way there, we get half way there and the car dies at an intersection. So I have him go to the passenger side and push while I steer and push from the drivers side. A nice man helped us push the car off the road. 

We then proceeded to try and figure out what happened. I know a little about cars so I’m looking and I can see right away that there is something sprayed all over the engine. I thought was oil but didn’t smell like oil and didn’t smell like coolant either. So we then decided how we are going to get the car and us home. We have roadside assistance that covers the tow and my mom came and picked us up. I felt so bad cause he couldn’t take his driving test and his car was now broken. 

Now for the silver lining to the story. At least 6 people stopped and asked if we needed help! Once we got the car home and my husband had a look at it we found out that is not going to be an expensive fix. The car blew a heater hose. And for some reason the battery crapped out, possibly cause of the alternator. 
All in all a somewhat cheap fix. Once we get that done we can yet again schedule another appointment for the driving test."
LovesAGoodNap,2021-04-28 11:13:57+00:00,4yo tries to hide it/ downplay it when he hurts himself,"My son has developed this weird habit in the past few months where he will try and hide it/downplay it when he hurts himself. 

Eg in the playground a while ago he knelt on a twig that pierced his jeans and cause his knee to bleed. I heard him say ‘ow’ but didn’t realise he was bleeding for about 5 minutes because he was very deliberately trying to hide it from me. 

Then this weekend I was playing with my 18mo daughter on the swings while he went off on his own, and a few minutes later he reappeared with tears on his cheeks limping a little. When I rushed over to him he just shouted ‘it’s all better’ and held out his arm to stop me getting too close. 

Basically if we’re doing something fun, and the injury isn’t severe enough to make him properly cry he’ll try and hide it. 

Now I understand that he doesn’t want to stop playing, but I need him to come to me if he hurts himself. Ive never been precious with him, if he’s ok to keep playing after I check him that’s cool, I’ll let him do that, but he’s acting like I’m going to put him in a glass box whenever he scrapes his knee. Maybe that’s what they do in his creche. 

My wife would be a bit more precious with him than me, but she doesn’t really bring him to the playground. He’s also fine showing injuries at home (when his sister bashes him which she often does) and if his sister hurts herself or is upset he’ll leave the playground to take her home without (much) objection. 

Any advice on getting him to chill?"

loveAlotte,2021-04-28 07:27:09+00:00,Please help - I don’t know how to handle my four year old,"I am at my wits end and I have no idea what to do any more. I have a nine month old daughter and a four and a half year old. Due to Covid-19 my four year old is home a lot. She was home for three months until March and is currently going to kindergarten 2 out of 5 days. 

I am so annoyed with her, sometimes I feel like I can’t love her. She constantly complains. I try to think of things to do for her that are fun and her go to answer is no, then she realizes what I said and sometimes says yes. Due to her being at home and me having to take care of her sister while also studying for college I let her watch about 2 hours of TV in the morning and in the evening. In between her friend comes over and they play together or I take them on small outings (going for ice cream for example) or I sometimes do scavenger hunts for them. It depends how the night went and how cranky the little one is.

I am not perfect, I am annoyed a lot because I feel so under appreciated by her and of course her little sister is quite demanding and my husband is a teacher and has to be at school - no more distance teaching.

I feel like I am constantly angry at my four year old and it drives us apart, because she wants to be with her dad. Granted, due to her sister, I can’t bring her to bed and actively playing with her gets harder each month as her little sister gets more and more mischievous.

There’s little time to spend alone with her because we have a lot going on and her sister is very attached to me.

Is this normal? Her complaint? Her always not liking the suggestions I made? 

Today a close friend invited her to an outing in the woods with a trained professional to discover nature and I was so excited to tell her. She simply said no, I don’t want to. No reason why, just no. She knows the friend, she will even go with her best friend, it’s something new to do and also the friend and her best friend are our upstairs neighbors so we spend a lot of time together and she knows them so it’s not like she doesn’t want to go because of them. She just doesn’t want to and I don’t get it. It’s everything she loves, biking and nature.

I am getting so tired trying to think of things for her. I feel like I am raising a spoiled little brat.

Please don’t judge me. I’ve also been doing the Corona thing for a year. I was heavily pregnant when it started, had a traumatic birth with a c-section and a recovery and trying to navigate everything while never catching a break. I am exhausted and so sad that I think I have lost the connection I had with my older daughter.

What can I do? Am I alone here?"
PrestigiousAd8555,2021-04-28 06:44:16+00:00,Weight gain issues in little kids,"I am prepared to get a beating for asking this question, but I’m hoping someone out there will truly understand my concern. 

My 6 year old is quite overweight. It is affecting her because she can’t run like her friends, she can’t climb like them. She gets out of breath easily and then things are not fun. She’s left out and she feels like something is not right with her. 

We have followed the cookie cutter pediatric weight loss diet. But it deprives her. She will sneak out behind my back to get a hold of junk food it I do that. Or keep eating something she likes till her stomach hurts. She also looks forward to the eating part of the day more than anything. 

In my understanding, kids that age usually stop eating once they’re full. Am I right? 

Now, I’m overweight myself but I do model healthy behavior. I cook everyday. We mostly eat at home. My husband/her dad is a runner and very fit. 

We have an HMO insurance and the primary care physician needs to put in a referral if we have to see an endocrinologist for her. Looking at me, the pcp probably believes that I’ve given her access to calorie dense food. We’re never taken seriously. 

My question is, a kid who eats healthy for most part and is active during the day is putting on weight. Shouldn’t this be further investigated? 

I don’t discuss this in front of her BTW. I just always have nutritious food around (my husband keeps me accountable honestly). We walk a lot as a family (she doesn’t enjoy of course) or bike ride. 

Has anyone actually got their little kid to lose weight? 
Again, we have high blood pressure and metabolic disorders in the family and I don’t want her to suffer from weight related issues. She’s very beautiful and it’s not about how she looks."

I am currently a mom(27) of a 20 month old lol, so really this isn't like a personal question, just more of some insight of what it is really like to have a teenager who might party? Or, ask to go to a party, do you parents let them? If so, how is it? If not, why not? And when will you let them go party? Now I was not really able to go to parties, I had to lie to my parents (mom+husband), they didn't give me permission to go to parties until I graduated high school. But when I did go to parties by telling them I was sleeping at a friend's house, we would go party and go back to her house to sleep, so I wasn't lying (but I lied when they asked, what we did with our night). Basically what I'm saying is parties and the things we did we're pretty crazy when I was in high school, and I just can't imagine how I'll ever allow my daughter to go with permission, but also don't want her to sneak around and lie like I did. Again this is just a random thought, lol just looking for some input on how y'all deal.."
BrightGarden9,2021-04-28 06:21:21+00:00,Annoying Neighbor Kids,"I have a kindergartener and a 3 year old. We just moved to this neighborhood and we met a group of 3 siblings across the  street and they hit it off with my kids immediately and wanted to play all the time. They came over a couple times a week for a while and then it got to be too much and they would make my 5 year old cry and just be rude and obnoxious and say things like our house is dirty and that I look pregnant when I'm not even pregnant. They would go into our food and start eating all the snacks out of the cabinet. So I started avoiding them because they seemed to be always outside waiting for us to get home. I started telling them no they can't come over. Their dad even told me to tell them not to come over if the time isn't right. So I started creating boundaries and telling them no.   


Then I let the girl come over last week after them not playing for like a couple months and her and my daughter played for a while and it was fine. But she came over the next day and I told her that we were about to eat dinner and she just stands at the door asking when she can come over or if she can come tomorrow and its so annoying because she doesn't take no for an answer. 

Then today she came over again right at 5:00 when we are both getting off work. I was actually still working because I work from home so I was not answering the door, but my husband walked in behind her I guess and she started asking him if she could come inside. I told him to tell her no and he did but she kept saying that I said she could come over and he got frustrated and walked off and told me to deal with her and left the door cracked and then our dog ran out into the street. 

At this point I am so mad because I've been working all day and the last thing I want to do is deal with this kid and chase my dog down the street. And I walked up to the door and yelled at my husband that ""he let the fucking dog out"" infront of the kid and I told her ""no its not a good time"" like really angrily. My husband is pissed and yelling too because he just got off work and doesn't want to chase the dog either. So I feel kind of bad for yelling in front of her...I know you shouldn't yell around kids but these kids are driving us both crazy and we are just like over-stressed from working all day and dealing with all this crap.   


Is it ok that I just don't want other people's kids at my house all the time? I remember when I was a kid I would ride my bike to my friends houses but I don't think it was every day. Between working and taking kids to school and everything else I have to do I barely get a chance to relax and I don't want some other kid bothering me because my own kids are enough work as it is. I know my daughter wants a little play friend, but during the week I'm like so stressed out from all the crap I have to do that I just don't want the responsibility of watching another kid.   


TLDR: Neighbor kids are annoying and don't take no for an answer, but my kids like them. I don't want them at my house all the time. They were cute at first but started being rude and annoying."
GuildensternsDilemma,2021-04-28 06:16:41+00:00,I’m afraid to tell me dad I love him,"Because I’ve never done it before, like many others my parents split up. It was pretty recent and it wasn’t on good terms, to sum it up my family has been riding the waves of guilt, fear, disappointment, and downright bottom of the barrel emotion that I don’t have a name for but the loving soul within me screams when I turn to confront this feeling. I’m not sure where it started or why it started but my mother heartbreakingly gave up on my father, while also giving up on love, and at least partially herself. Writing this now I realize that the bottom barrel feeling might be guilt, the reason my mom left, or at least the final straw, was a message I sent her out of anger and resentment for all of the anger and resentment she had for my father. But of course I don’t know the full story, apparently my father had been forceful with their intimate relationship and even physically threatening. None of which I wanted to know but all of which brings me pain and I swear I can feel the tear in my heart as I talk about it. I’m sitting in my basement room, 3 days before I move out because I can’t withstand the pain this house brings me, because everyone left, and I’m all alone. But my dad is still here it’s his birthday, but every time I think about the love I have for him there’s an evil tainted scar on top of it, put there by my mother, and so I don’t know if I fully love her either, simply because it wouldn’t be fair to my father. It wasn’t anyone’s fault in particular, my mother had an issue with my father, but my father was too intimidating for her to talk to him about it, which I can’t help but see as her being too afraid to stand up to him which means a happy life for our family was not enough for her to throw away fear. But I sit here now in the same position, doing the exact same thing, leaving my father, essentially giving up, because I just can’t seem to face him with vulnerability. It’s like I’m afraid he’ll reach into my stomach and crush the only love I have left for him. And that’s not what I want because I know he’s doing it because he’s afraid, afraid we’ll leave him so he just decides fuck it I’ll push them away myself, one last act of power, even if it sacrifices love. So now I’m left with all of these facts and ALL of the facts point toward the oh so common answer “you need to cut toxic people out of your life, even if it’s a close family member or friend, trust me it gets better” but that’s not the answer I want, love is all powerful in this reality, it can conquer all by surrendering as a stepping stool. But I think love is like a trap, it elevates its opposition so high that it can see everything, a hateful idea raised high enough will look around at the view and see nothing but love, therefore becoming it itself. But maybe I’m naive, or rather, maybe you think I am, I know I am not. But I ask for your advice anyway, and more than anything I could really use a hug, and a little bit of support. Thank you for reading &lt;3 it means everything to me"

Seeing who can get who in trouble first. I put together a “clip chart” where if my kid makes a bad choice I clip them down and if they get to red then they lose _______ for a week. My fiancé (their dad) was laughing that I break lots of the rules I have for them and I was being a hypocrite. I always say I want to “teach my kids now”, because my mom acted as my maid and I never had to lift a finger or do anything I didn’t want to and now, as an adult, I am having to teach myself how to function. 

So, I made a “clip chart” for my kids to clip me down for every rule I break, if I get to red they choose my punishment. This may have been a bad plan, but I am curious about how it will go."
kitterific,2021-04-28 05:03:39+00:00,Pre Partum Depression?,"Is that a thing?

I don’t know if what I feel is depression or something else. Apathy? Reluctance? Exhaustion? I just know that I am not as excited through this pregnancy as I was for my first. Even though it was 100% wanted and planned. I am 24 weeks pregnant.

It is hard for me (30F) to describe how I feel to my husband (34M) and our toddler (2.4M) is obviously oblivious. There is a lot of background and I can expand if necessary, but I’ll try to keep it short.

My husband is the breadwinner of the household. That wasn’t always the case, so I’m left feeling a little.. useless, though I know it isn’t the truth. He has a lot on his plate, especially now. My husband works 50-60 hours/week and is pursing school for two separate masters degrees. He has very little time for much else besides work and studies. He recently quit his job to work from home and makes a good deal more than he did at an office (which wasn’t much). Though, we are getting by financially, money is still a little tight and somewhat uncertain. 

I used to be the main provider until I got pregnant the first time with our son. Shortly before I gave birth, my husband acquired a new job (the one he just recently left) and, after he proved himself there, I was offered a position with my husband’s company. Now, the pay at this company has never been great. Together, we both made minimum wage. I was able to work from home as a personal assistant for $250/week. Yikes. Barely worth it, but it helps me feel somewhat useful while being able to care for our son full-time from home. It pays for a few essential bills. I still work in this position, but am seeking something better. The work has always been demanding and I put in 30-40 hours of active work per week. I am expected to be available at a moment’s notice from 8:00am-8:00pm 7 days/week and assist 3 agents at a realty company. There have been times where I have had to ignore my son to meet their demands. Now that I have my own license, I am looking to move on. Not working isn’t an option because our financial situation is rather unstable at the moment and my husband needs me to contribute so he can focus more time on school for our future benefit.

Sorry, this is getting longer than I expected..

My son is very attached. We all have a great relationship with each other and he has really blossomed SO MUCH with my husband at home. Though, as I mentioned, my husband is his own level of busy and can’t do much of the care. That has always been our arrangement. I am more than happy to take care of the household and caregiver duties to ensure my husband can provide us with a better future. He scoops the cat litter and does the odd task that I ask and I do the rest. I handle the diaper changes, the put-downs for naps and bedtime, meal prep/groceries, play time/stimulation , the wiping of surfaces 5x per day (toddlers are sticky), the vacuuming (so much vacuuming...), dishes, laundry, general cleaning, etc. 

My husband is great about supporting me when I ask, and I try not to ask because his work and studies are both SO demanding. But it’s taking a toll. I’m just feeling burnt out. I don’t know how I can handle a second child. 

Our toddler is a good kid, but he is in the “terrible twos” and we are feeling it through his tantrums. His speech is delayed, so communication is tough. He is making great progress with his speech therapist, but it is still difficult most times. He is the world’s worst sleeper. It was not until he was 19 months old that he slept for longer than 5 hours at a time. I went over 1.5 years on a very broken up 2-3 hours per night (30 minutes here, an hour there) and it was torture. I now average 4-6 hours per night and he tends to only wake 1-2 times. Such a blessing. We send him to daycare for 3 hours/day, 4 days/week. The break is enough to allow me to focus and catch up on my job. He naps about 1-2 hours in the afternoon, lately, which has been great for a bit of a break and getting more work/chores done. It is difficult because he still nurses to sleep, purely out of comfort, so my husband can’t put him down. However, he is starting to wean himself slowly. Very slowly. 

To make things even better, we have no family close by to help. My mom passed away 3 weeks before my son was born and my dad lives across the country, a 22 hour drive away. My husband’s parents are just 2.5 hours away, but not close enough to help, and are preparing to move to Europe. Daycare is limited and based on the school schedule, so we will have to go without care during the summer or pay 4x as much for a different facility. We have no friends or support in the area and don’t even know where to find a babysitter. We are alone.

So, I guess onto the issue... I’m not excited about this upcoming baby. I very much wanted a second child when our boy was younger and sorta talked my husband into how great it would be. Now that I am 24 weeks pregnant, I have yet to feel excited. I feel regret. We have not been as involved in this one because how little we have been able to focus on anything besides work. We have only discussed names on 3 separate occasions and only for a short discussion. He is not allowed to the doctor appointments due to COVID, so his involvement has been severely limited, except for one ultrasound. I have virtually no pregnancy symptoms (not complaining!!) besides getting “fatter” and feeling the baby move. So I am less focused on the physical changes. It’s like.. just not on the radar for us. I know my hormones are acting up, because I don’t usually feel so overwhelmed, tired, and constantly sad or on the verge of giving up. I just feel alone and helpless. But is it just being overworked and neglected in a sense? Am I being too dramatic? Can I properly care for my son AND a newborn? My husband will have an insane work/school schedule for a few years until things stabilize and I’ll be left filling the void. It seems like too much. Once I leave my current occupation, it will be so much easier, but much more uncertain. Can I begin a new career as an independent contract worker and find leads/close sales on my own with a demanding toddler and a newborn? Our little family is so close and happy, how will our boy handle a new addition? We have tried explaining it to him, but it’s all just a woosh. And he is so attached, there are going to be major jealousy issues. I’m just not ready. We haven’t even prepared for the new baby in the least bit. It’s so much. I have so little energy.



Sorry this got so long. Typing it all out has been therapeutic, even if nothing else comes of it.

TLDR: Overworked, tired Mama with an overworked, tired husband and a very attached toddler that already has communication troubles and is bound to have jealousy issues. We have no support network and are alone. Please send help."

KingdomOfDirt,2021-04-28 04:44:45+00:00,Living with In-Law who doesn't have boundaries!,"I like/love my MIL but she doesn't have boundaries and my husband doesn't either. She's extremely pushy/nosy to the point whereas my husband says it's better to just cave and let her do what she wants because she is so relentless it's uncomfortable. I'm a person that's incredibly private and quiet and because she is the way she is and I am the way I am... I have found myself under extreme mental stress. 

My biggest example today is that I was trying to parent my children. I like to do natural consequences and just let the kids learn on their own. Tonight one kid wanted to try and switch bedtime outfits and wanted me to find the specific outfit and dress them. The kid is perfectly capable of getting dressed and finding their own clothes at the point. I said sure to have at it but the lights are turning off in five minutes and I've already gotten you ready for bed so if you haven't figured out the outfit by them you are out of luck. Obviously, the kid didn't like that and spent time doing obvious things to try and lure me into a drama of finding their outfit and re-dressing them. The problem is the whole time MIL kept jumping into the conversation and messing up the flow. Talking over me until I was literally yelling. Jumping up and rushing around to try and find the special clothing the kid wanted. Trying to get the kid out of her shoes (that's my kid's other ploy to try and prolong bedtime. They can take shoes off now but try and make you do it and make it a drama when you won't so they can stay awake longer) I want them to learn the lights are going off in five. I did my job and cared for them... if they choose to undo it that's on them. It sucks to sleep in shoes, it sucks to wear the heavy hot nightgown they wanted... it sucks to try and have to do that in the dark without the normal tuck-in-routine and so forth. This method of teaching has worked amazingly for my kids in the past... IF I can ever employ it! 

Not only that but I feel like MIL robs me of nice mothering moments as well. Like today the kids were painting butterflies and asking about what color the butterflies can be. They asked ME directly but I had to rush to get my words out before MIL cut me off and started yammering on into a science lesson and leaving me in the dust. 

The house is small and paper-thin walls. I can't fart three rooms over without her hearing it and zooming out of her room to interfere with everything. 

I've set boundaries before but the other family and she included always act like I've done something really horrible to her. My husband is slowly starting to break out of his routines but it's not fast or good enough. For example.... kid has a bathroom issue the other day and we had company over. Husband took on the issue and kept kid fix everything in private so they weren't embarrassed but as soon as he and they came out of their bedroom MIL in front of everybody loudly asked what was going on???? Husband snapped back none of your damn business because he just got to deal with a very emotionally embarrassed child that didn't want everyone to know anything about what happened. Everyone (but me) GASPED and I just laughed which got more GASPS from the family. and he immediately apologized 
 to her. 

Anyway, you guys are more than welcome to jump in with thoughts, advice, or criticism if you want. I'm mostly just venting. I know what I need to do... make boundaries and enforce them but that's hard when your hip deep in emotions and family."

Call out to those with spirited children!,"Considering Montessori for my wilful, stubborn, spirited, delightful, hilarious and moody child when he turns 3. I have visions of the transition period being chaotic as he gets used to new expectations. I love what Montessori can offer in terms of confidence, courtesy and responsibility (which are things that I really want to instil but I’m not sure I’m doing a great job of it at home based on current results! ). Also we are behind in potty training since birth of second child = regression. So….maybe in my heart of hearts I’m concerned that it won’t be the best fit for my son. Don’t want to squash my square peg of child into a round hole and set him up for failure. On the flip side, I’m hoping that Montessori could help him with preparation for school (he’ll be attending regular school). The Montessori school is accredited and highly regarded so I’ve no concerns that they are “Montessori” in name only.

amyisntdead,2021-04-28 03:55:41+00:00,Working Night Shift as a Single Parent,"Hello! So, I'm a single mom to a 4th grader. I typically have her from Wednesday evenings to Monday evenings. I've always worked a 9am to 5pm schedule but lately I've been thinking of switching to 3rd shift for a couple of reasons. I've had sleep issues my whole life and am more of a night owl. I also am getting so tired of working a 9 to 5, I just crave a different routine where I'm available to be with my daughter and take her to appointments when needed.

I've  recently come across a specific job that would be from 8:00pm to 4:30am that I feel would be near perfect hours. I can get home, cook breakfast for my daughter, and sleep in until my daughter is done with school. My daughter is still schooling online from about 8am to 3pm so I'll be asleep but she can wake me up at anytime if she needs anything. She tends to be pretty independent with school. Then I'd have free time with her until about 7pm when I would leave for work.

This schedule seems great to me but I've always heard how hard night shifts can be so I'm a bit worried that I may be overlooking a certain obstacle. I also have seen many people posting about how they have less time with their children when working nights,  but I feel like I'd be having more time with her, if not the same amount.

I should also mention when I'm away at work I plan to have her sleep over with a family member and I'd pick her up on my way back home. So childcare would be covered.

Just wondering if how you all managed a 3rd shift job and any pros/cons that I may not be thinking of."

TankedInATutu,2021-04-28 02:59:44+00:00,But Do They Really Though?,"Apologies in advance for any weird grammar or formatting, it's late and I can't chill out enough to sleep. I had an exhausting conversation with my mom earlier that I can't shake off. Lots of parenting related topics and philosophies were brought up with me (after acknowledging that none of it was immediately relevant to me because I only have a toddler) landing in the camp of ""when reasonable give kids of all ages grace and space to be as ridiculous/emotional as they feel compelled in a safe space and also their boundaries deserve respect just like any adults"" and her falling more in with a ""kids need to know that the world won't cater to their wants and needs"". 

There are definitely things that my parents could have done differently, but they were objectively good parents. The missteps were minor in retrospect and came from good intentions. But I can't wrap my around my mom's stance. Yeah, the world doesn't care about your feelings but that doesn't mean no one cares about your feelings. And why does a kid need to learn that lesson, but the adults don't (the inciting example was grandma wants a hug, but jr. doesn't like peoole touching him)? What's wrong with making sure kids know that it's okay to ask that people respect your preferences? Obviously there's a lot of gray area because too far one way is full of entitlement and the other way is laying the foundation for an adult who doesn't know how to respectfully and confidently advocate for themselves. 

It's silly, but this is swirling around my brain and stopping me from sleeping. I recognize the merit in teaching kids that they can't always get their way, but I don't feel like I benefited from that attitude. At least not the way my parents went about it. But I also haven't been at this parenting thing very long. I'm tired and have entirely too much work to do tomorrow to still be awake."
Mysterious_Ebb5229,2021-04-28 02:54:36+00:00,How do you get your toddlers to sleep through the night???,My 21 month-old will not sleep through the night. She'll go to bed at around 9 then wake up in the middle of the night around 2 or 3 am and then be up until the next day. She takes only one nap a day and be up by 3pm and still wake up in the middle of night. Even if she's tuckered out from the park she'll still wake up. I'm trying to get a good schedule going for everyone but it's really hard when she wakes in the middle of the night and won't go back to sleep. It throws her entire schedule off.

i_do_not_know101,2021-04-28 01:31:37+00:00,My 17mo boy can’t eat anything but this one barley based baby cereal,"Idk what else to feed him, whatever else I give him, he either chokes on it or has some sort of delayed allergic/ symptomatic reaction. 

The only thing I feed him is breast milk and Heinz barley baby cereal. 

I tried feeding him smashed bananas, boiled sweet potatoes, peas, carrots, potatoes, and boiled egg. My husband gives him those squeezable fruits bag things every once in a while and he can’t even handle those things. He starts having reactions like jerking awake in his sleep while crying loudly (which doesn’t happen if I follow my breast milk and barley cereal routine), his nose and area around his mouth turns reddish, he rubs his nose and eyes a lot as they turn red, and overall becomes more whiny and just sticks to me while being in a bad mood the whole time (he usually runs and plays around and is in a good mood with the regular diet routine ). Either that, or he cannot get it down his throat cuz he can’t chew properly and starts chocking violently, even if it’s a very soft, small piece of food.  

I’m worried he isnt getting all the nutrition he needs to be getting to grow up strong and healthy. His teethes came is about a mouth ago and he started walking about 5 months ago, I don’t want anything else to be delayed. I also don’t want to feed him the same barley cereal 4-5 times a day, but rather give him a variety of new flavours to try out. 

I don’t know what to do, I want him to have variety and be healthy."
undulatus9,2021-04-28 01:31:25+00:00,"Noticing insecurity about looks in 6-year-old step daughter, unsure of what to do","So I am a step mother to a 6-year-old girl. I have known her for about a year and we have bonded very well. Recently she has started to open up to me every once in a while about her disappointment with her looks- lamenting about how she has brown hair and wishing she had blonde hair like her favorite cartoon characters or random children at the grocery store. She also has told me that she dislikes being pale and wishes she could have tan skin. She also is constantly talking about the eventual children my husband and I will have, and is obsessed with the possibility that it will come out with blonde hair and blue eyes. When she looks in the mirror sometimes she gets sad and her mood is a bit sour for a while. I asked my husband about this and he said that he's never heard her say anything like that, so I'm not sure if this is a new development from something at school or if I'm the only person she's opened up to (I'm the first female figure she's ever had in her life besides her grandmother). She has even started to criticize aspects of my appearance, like my curly hair, and tries to ""straighten"" it with a hair brush. I've talked to her about keeping comments to herself regarding others' looks but I have a feeling that it might just be her imposing the standards she's learned from somewhere. 

 These comments are very disconcerting to me, mostly because at 6 she should not be concerned about her appearance, at all, but also because I was exactly the same way as a child. I had a dismissive and emotionally abusive mother that criticized my looks and had always wanted tan skin and blonde hair growing up. I'm sort of at a loss here because I can't talk to her like I would a peer, and I'm worried that maybe there's something going on at school, at grandma's (grandma and grandpa are her babysitters when we are at work) or if she's just watching too much media. How can I make her feel better? Is this something that would warrant therapy? Or is my questionable childhood just causing me to overreact?"

I took a brief moment to think and then told him, “Colored nails are for anyone who wants them.”
He excitedly told me he wants light blue nails, so I got light blue nail polish with the groceries yesterday, and tonight, we painted them together.
We were sitting there in the bathroom together while they dried, him watching something on Netflix and I was reading a book, just keeping him company.
My husband was walking by, said hello, and then stopped in his tracks and said, angrily, “What did you do?”
Son was oblivious, engrossed in his show.
“We painted his nails light blue, his favorite color!” I replied, keeping a smile. 
He mouthed, “What the fuck?” at me (the “fuck” was audible) and walked away.

To be fair, he didn’t know we were going to do this; he works long hour weekends (Saturday-Monday) and wasn’t around for the conversation. I didn’t really anticipate it being a point of contention.
I don’t think I’m being unreasonable in painting my son’s nails at his request, and I’d really just like some advice about how to navigate this impending conversation with my husband (sure to happen after the kiddos go to bed) while he is engaging in.... toxic masculinity? Am I overreacting in assuming this is toxic masculinity?

under_rated_human,2021-04-28 01:16:19+00:00,Tips for Getting Toddler to Eat Dinner,"So to backtrack a bit, my toddler will eat dinner (he'll actually eat most of what we give him) but he won't eat the meat or protein (usually beans). He loves spaghetti but will take what little bit of ground beef that is in his bowl and literally throw it on the ground (naturally we are trying to stop this, but it's a work in progress). He likes chicken nuggets too and will eat oven-baked ones, but we've tried giving him shredded chicken covered in a sauce that he's eaten before and liked. That too ended up on the ground. My MIL has tried endlessly to give him beans (both whole and refried) and those are also a 'no'. We are at a loss, he's not malnourished or underweight and he gets enough fruits and veggies amongst other foods, but we'd really like him to get more protein in his diet.

Both older kids are wanting extra cash and have a TON of free time.  I have also been ill recently.  Each morning recently they ask how I’m feeling.  If things are rough, they offer to watch the younger kids.  

I am effusively appreciative and give them as much cash as I can- to the point that we have about the same amount in our account as each of our kids do, lol.  

Occasionally they act resentful of the setup.  I ask them not to offer if it’s not something they want to help me with.  But they keep offering for two reasons- to help me through this tough time and also to earn cash.  

Any thoughts as to how we can clean this whole process up?  I’m filled with guilt, they’re resentful, and yet in ways this setup works for all of us."
veronicab27,2021-04-28 00:28:43+00:00,2 year old throwing tantrums and harming himself,"Hi everyone! This is a long one and kind of rambling, sorry! I have an almost two year old son (21 months to be exact) that within the past few months has started throwing what I would call extreme? temper tantrums. He was the easiest baby, and up until now has been the most easy going, sweetest toddler. Some are so bad he almost makes himself sick, will bite his hand so hard it leaves marks, or will hit himself in the head or face. He usually will throw a tantrum when I tell him no or won’t allow him to do something he has set out to do. For example, todays tantrum was because I told him he couldn’t swim in the duck pond at the park lol. I tried holding his hand and redirecting him, he threw himself down on the ground, snatched his hand away and started walking back towards the pond. This lasted well over five minutes. It got to the point I decided to leave the park because I could just not calm him down or redirect him. I was so embarrassed. I’m just not used to him behaving this way. At home he’s a relatively laid back, easy going toddler (every once in awhile he’ll hit himself if he’s told no) He also pretty much has free reign of his space at home. Meaning he has toys he can play with, books to look at and a big couch to cozy up on. Same with our backyard at home. It’s fenced in and he has many activities that he can hop around to. Very rarely is a temper tantrum thrown at home. I should also mention him and I are home the majority of the week. One day a week he spends the day with his grandma and cousin aged 2 1/2 while I work and one day we usually go shopping or out to eat with his grandpa. I’m wondering if these tantrums and the hitting are partly due to him not receiving a lot of time with other children or in a more structured setting? My husband thinks it’s his age and he’s too young to go to daycare/preschool. I’m sure I’ll get over my embarrassment of the tantrums but I’m also really concerned about him harming himself. Any insight or advice would be so appreciated."

annacondah,2021-04-28 00:05:50+00:00,My 8-year-old is a VERY picky eater &amp; tries to puke up new foods. Advice? (Possible TL;DR),"Good evening, everyone! Just joined the group and have a huge predicament on my hands. I'm doing the best to my ability with this so any advice is greatly appreciated. Apologies for weird formatting as I'm mobile. 



My child is eight &amp; the only grandchild on both sides of the family. I've been working since she was an infant, so I do admit my absence &amp; the grands' prominent presence in place share blame with her being an incredibly picky eater. If it isn't chicken, potatoes, toast, yogurt, or any basic fruit (generally speaking), it's a no. When I try to introduce new foods, it's drama: eating all but the offending food, arguing, and tears mainly. Now I don't stray too far with new foods, so it's been mainly carrots, corn, and spinach (Spinach is cool with her). I'm also not lpud or aggressive about it. To be honest, even one bite is a victory some nights. This particular night, however, was ROUGH. 

A couple nights ago, I made a simple dinner of grilled chicken, roasted potatoes &amp; **zucchini**. A pretty harmless addition, right? NOPE. After 20 minutes of the usual trying to get out of it, she tried a bite with some chicken resulting in dry-heaving &amp; near-hyperventilating for 5 minutes until regurgitating the forkful onto the plate. Not what food she had eaten , but this one bite. I got her calmed down, cleaned up, and dinner was over. 



I'm really at a loss over this &amp; don't know the next step to take aside from trying again in a week or so. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
page456,2021-04-28 00:01:20+00:00,How to tell child you cut off toxic family ?,"Without getting into too much, I have a covert narcissist mother and my husbands aunt is passive aggressive and a nasty person as well. These women likely both have their own issues as they can’t seem to explain why they are bad to me but I finally had enough of forgiving and forgetting and mentioned them to our marriage counselor through various sessions.

She agreed with me.. these women are toxic and if someone cannot be loving and kind to our entire family then they don’t get access to our kids or continue to get to engage with me and make me miserable. 

Aunt in law was given a chance to talk and ignored all emails and letters (she got them as we attached tracking) and narc mom Will boundary stomp and do something literally 8 times in a row you’ve asked them not to.. she won’t say sorry so we are not in contact either.

I’m mid 30s but finally now learning to stay more composed and hold my ground and expect an apology and changed behavior to move forward and neither of these women like that or will do it.

My kids are 2, 5 and 7 and the older two (mainly the oldest) press and ask where they are or why we can’t go visit etc. My oldest really wears me out.. 

My in laws invited crappy aunt over knowing I was coming with my kids and I said nope not going in.. won’t be having dinner.. this lady is nasty and I was ticked my in laws failed to tell me
She was there knowing the issues at hand.

My son nonstop bugged me about why he couldn’t go inside abuelitos house and presses nonstop..

Instead of telling my kids Their grandma is psycho &amp; tried telling their dad their mom needs to be on heavy psych meds (yes she is sick) or that their aunt purposely won’t write my name on anything, hands out gifts in front of me making sure I see she got me nothing, said I “still look pregnant”.. and all the other nasty details.. I finally just said “So and so is not nice to mommy so we aren’t hanging out now. They have to think about it and we have to talk one day maybe but right now we are on a break ok?” And I stress to my kids that everyone has to treat all members of our family kindly.

My husband got uptight about this despite him knowing an agreeing his aunt is awful to me.. bc I’m “involving kids.. “ when I was pretty mad my in laws (his parents) put me in the awkward and crap situation to have to explain to my son.. 

I feel like I gave an age appropriate explanation and I’m irked my husband has the audacity to act like we have to keep protecting crappy people and their crap behavior 

Did this my entire life for my narc mom while she backstabbed me and made me look crazy but I was raised under that whole idea we don’t talk about family and blood is blood.. and I always covered up awful shit she did but finally got sick of it the last few years seeing she wasn’t a person making mistakes but a real toxic person 

My husband quipped “ok well how about I tell them about your mom then?” And I said “I already did! Told them we are on a break from grandma too bc she’s not being nice to mommy..”

I’m sick of hiding the shit others do and have debated telling my kids the entire truth as older teens.. I’m tired of looking like the bad guy personally and dealing with two covert narcissists is really hard.. they are very conniving and the type who will absolutely plant poison in your kids head ever so subtly to set you up as the bad guy so for me it’s
Important for me to be honest and open with my kids and I felt that was about right for their age.

My husband doesn’t agree and it truly angers me. Am
I wrong? He said I’m getting kids involved in adult matters and I don’t agree.. what should I do or say?"

I got the stuff together and told her to wait one minute while I got the last things we needed.

I went and found my daughter in her bedroom under the covers thinking I would be mad at her. I wasn’t. I first asked her if she was OK and then asked her what happened. She said: “I didn’t know it was made out of glass.”

It made perfect sense. The blender doesn’t really look like glass to a 5 y/o. She didn’t mean to break anything. It was an honest mistake. She had been really looking forward to making this smoothie.

Lemonintolemonade,2021-04-27 23:12:03+00:00,Advice - daughter never shows affection,"Daughter is 8yo, has always been very moody. She’s hard to please - never satisfied. She’s also very sensitive, and keeps a lot to herself. 

I encourage her to talk, say what’s on her mind, and express her emotions. She says it’s hard and she would rather not. 

I used to question myself and think the way she is was my fault. My 2yo daughter is the complete oppositive (extra affectionate, expresses gratitude daily, etc.), so I now think it’s part of who she is, and not a consequence of my parenting. 

I try to use positive parenting as much as I can, I have read all of Janet Lansbury’s books and really think I’m providing her a safe and loving environment.

I would like to teach her the importance of treating people who loves her with attention and consideration. For example; when I drop her off to school, I go for a hug and say « I love you », and I’m lucky if I get a « bye mom » back. Same thing at night, when I tell her I love her before she goes to bed, she stands awkwardly and only replies « goodnight mom ». I would like for her to express her feelings but it seems so hard for her to do. 

Am I crazy for pushing her to think about how to treat the ones who love and care about her? Should I just accept her the way she is and keep on doing my thing even though I basically never get a reaction from showing my love and affection?"

cer216,2021-04-27 23:01:47+00:00,Society and Motherhood,"Sometimes it feels like American society sets women up for failure.

Have a baby, lose the weight, get back to work. 

If you’re lucky to have a support system, or extended family to help with your children,  I am envious. 

Today was like any other day trying to get childcare for my youngest of 3 children. I received an excellent job opportunity at a school, but my child is too young to attend. Every nursery school is full, she’s on half a dozen waiting lists. 

I called one woman and she said she charges $18 per hour, and I was told I would only be making $15 per hour.. I forgot to mention that I will also be responsible for my other child’s tuition. 

Basically I will be earning nothing except validation from society that I am actively working. Also the biggest factor is I just want to do what’s best for my children, and give them all opportunities to socialize and thrive; even if I don’t earn a dollar. But how can I afford to pay more than I even earn?

My middle child was just diagnosed with T1D, 4 months ago. So when I got this offer at this school, I was happy that they had a preschool program for my child to attend. I felt safer knowing that even though I wouldn’t be in the same room I was just upstairs. 

I graduated in 2020, with 3 kids under age 5, in a pandemic; with multiple honors. I have worked hard and I push myself to keep trying but it just feels like it doesn’t matter. 

I have no support, and my husband is never home because he is financially providing for our family. Currently I am working in food service on nights and weekends when he is able to be with our children. I am not too proud to stay at a job that puts food on the table, even though my education makes me “over qualified”. I am just grateful to be employed and have any opportunity to help provide for my family. 

What kind of American Dream is this? One where my husband and I are like two passing ships and we never see each other? A life where I get asked about my marital status and children in job interviews? A life where I feel like I’m not good enough? Consistently putting my own needs last and feeling like an empty shell... 

Well I declined the job offer, it’s done; and so is my faith in the American Dream. It is more like an American nightmare that I wish I could wake up from. I want to live somewhere that society places a higher value on family and not corporations. I want to live somewhere where employers ask me about my skills and not my personal life and children."
Nixiiebaby,2021-04-27 22:59:30+00:00,"What would you do.... Kiddo, 14M Doesn't want to live with Dad....","This might get long.. and if it does, I'll add a TL;DR.

\*deep sigh\*

My kiddo, 14M, does NOT want to live with his dad. 

\- We have week on week off custody, with both of us being his (M) legal guardians.   
\- I (N) have remarried (A), dad (J) has a live in girlfriend (S).   
\- I live closer to his school (private school) than his dad now does, but only by maybe 10 minutes.  
\- I have three other kids, two older (by marriage) and one younger (with current partner). His dad has two 'step' children, one older and one younger.  
\- I am one of those froofy peaceful parents that doesn't parent from a place of anger. I don't spank and my punishments are usually losing privileges. His dad will take zero advice from me and is 100% anti-ex wife. (We've been divorced the better part of a decade, at least. I lost count because YAY I'M NOT MARRIED TO HIM ANYMORE!!)

The last several months have been building up to a much bigger explosion than any of us were anticipating. The usual ""I want to live with my mom, I like her house better."" Fine. There's no reason you can't go to your dads.. there's nothing wrong with his house. Anxiety spikes for M, he starts falling behind in school more and more, escalating to missing school entirely because, according to J, he (M) wasn't ready on time and he (J) had to work (from home.) Unexcused absences are Zeros and bring down his grade. At my house, M is the priority and even if he is late to school, he gets there. (He's usually never more than 15 minutes late and first period is home room, so it doesn't count against him.)

Anyway! Almost a month ago, M was making noise about not wanting to go back to his dads house - per usual. He hates the transition. I suggested maybe we try Sunday exchanges, because he often complained of having to take his backpack full of laptop and meds to school on Monday for transitions.. and this way would reduce the amount of stuff he had to take on Monday. His dad agreed. Sunday came, and nope don't wanna go. I text his dad and say ""hey, Team M needs to have a meeting and talk about what is going on. When can you come over?"" He says ""Sorry can't, but you're welcome to come here."" We took him at his word and packed kiddo up in the car and headed over. J seemed taken aback that we took him up on the offer but invited us in, regardless. Apparently, he forgot to tell S that we were coming over and coming in.. she was not happy. M couldn't put his thoughts into words, but kept shaking and crying and begging me to take him back home with me. I put on my brave face and told him he'd be fine. After we left, M overheard his dad and S talking about ""the audacity"" I had walking into HER house and overstepping my boundaries and how NOT OKAY it was. I legit just said ""Hey, your dad loves you. You'll be fine. Talk to your dad about how you feel, work through it if you can."" and when M asked me to voice his main complaint, I was like ""you sure, dude?"" and he was like ""YES. Please. I can't"" and when I did, S was very annoyed, so I imagine her comments about my audacity were bringing up the fact M doesn't like hearing her scream at her oldest kid. I diffused and played it down that it's just louder because the kitchen is next to his bedroom - and maybe they could soundproof that wall to help deaden the sound since he can be sensitive to loud noises. No response from J on that one, but whatever - his house, his problem. That entire week I got texts from M begging me to let him come back. I kept explaining as much as I'd love to, legally I cannot.

Fast forward to last week, it's time to go back to dad.. dad texts and says he's on the way to pick M up and have him ready to go. M nopes out again, I invite J into the house and say ""you might want to talk to him."" And left the room. M tells him all his reasons for not wanting to go back, etc. J got passive aggressive and started saying things like ""If you don't come back with me, I'll sell all your stuff and convert your room."" and ""Fine, you don't have a room at my house anymore"". When M begged him not to sell his stuff, and was crying saying ""I love you but I can't live with you right now, please don't sell my stuff."" J told him he was being irrational and crazy and finally got annoyed and just left, announcing to me he was calling his dr to change his meds because ""He's manic, or something. I can't make sense of it."" I didn't hear all of the convo, and M didn't share with. me more than what I've shared above.  (Yes, he has a therapist who he JUST started seeing and is getting to help unpack a LOT of baggage so quick into her time with him.)

All week, J texts M asking him to call, saying he misses him, etc. M ignores them and asks me what to do. I tell him.... ""Talk to your dad"". I give him advice on how to talk to him, as I've known his dad more than half my life at this point. I tell him to make lists and keep a journal. Write things down, email them to yourself if you need to. Text yourself, whatever works. We make lists together. He plans out his ""perfect world"". (basically, living with me full time and seeing his dad on weekends and some holidays) then he plans out his almost perfect world. He asks his dad to pick him up from school Tuesday and dad is like YEAH! but then several hours later, he sends a text to his dad saying, no nevermind, don't. I can't do it. J texts me to intervene. A and I intervene as much as we can and get him to agree to go to his dads house for the week. (I grilled him to make sure there is no immediate harm, house is clean, no one hits him or touches him inappropriately, etc) By his last class of the day, he starts noping out of everything again, but eventually resigned to letting J pick him up. I got texts from him about half an hour after dismissal begging me to come get him... then 20 minutes later saying nevermind, he'll be okay for the week. At this point, his teachers are emailing and asking if things are okay because for two weeks he was doing great and suddenly he's having a really hard time.. and when I explain he went back to his dad today they are like ""Oh.""

M has been telling me random tidbits here and there about how when he asked his dad about why he spent more time with him than me in the early days of our divorce - dad says ""because your mom didn't want you."" Which is absolutely untrue - he prevented me from seeing him, kept telling his lawyer i was a drug addict, or a shoplifter, unstable, etc. Countless home studies, and drug tests, and evaluations later I proved those were all false. Our divorce was bitter and brutal. J and S talk crap about me where M can hear it and then act like he's making it up.. ""He's crazy"", ""He misheard"", ""You're twisting my words"" or my favorite ""It was just a joke.""

I want to consult a lawyer to see what my options even are, but my husband isn't ready to go full blast just yet. In our perfect world, my kid is happy and healthy and spends equal time between his dads house and mine.... but I am also willing to go full mama bear.   


So, what would you do?  


TL;DR My 14yo kid doesn't want to live with his dad because his dad is being emotionally abusive. He's falling behind in school because of the anxiety and depression from having to spend time at his dads house and wants to live with me full time. Ex and his partner aren't taking it seriously and acting like I'm just trying to use our son against them."
plukhkuk,2021-04-27 22:24:36+00:00,Separation Anxiety made worse by the pandemic?,"So my baby just turned 8 months a few days ago and for about a week has been showing all the signs of separation anxiety. She would even cry if I go to the kitchen or the bathroom even if her dad stays with her. It's quite terrible to be honest. Today I took some me time so I could nap/relax and just stayed in the bedroom with snacks and tea for over 3 hours. She cried so hard! It was tough but I seriously needed a break.

So I know that having baby interact and leaving her with other people - family and family friends helps with the separation anxiety but due to lockdowns my baby only ever spent time with me and her dad. I started going out more with the baby but I feel that we lost so many opportunities for my baby to get used being around other people.

This is especially worrying for me because in about 2-3 months I'm planning to go back to work and put her in day care... it just seems it will be very hard for her and me..."
SNewton97,2021-04-27 22:22:46+00:00,How to handle a complaining child.,"So my SD is 8 years old and this has been an issue for little over a 2 years now and only seems to be getting worse. My SD is a major complainer. It's gotten to the point where I don't want to take her places or do things with her because I know she will always find things to complain about. 


For example(and just because I want to rant about it), we took a family trip to the zoo not long ago. On the drive to the zoo, she complained about the time of the drive and how bored she was(even though she has an iPad with games and books). Once we got to the zoo ticket booth she complained about the how loud the people were and how hot it was(it was 75°f and a lovely spring day). We then got in and started walking, after just 30 minutes we got complaints about how her feet hurt, she is too hot and sweaty, we are going to fast, but when we slow down we are going too slow. She even started complaining about how her shirt was too tight, even though it is new and fits her well. We tell her we will break fo lunch at the midway point, soon we get complaints about how she is just starving and can't wait untill 12, how we didn't bring the snacks she wanted, her water is too warm, she wants to sit over at x spot and not where we sat down. Once her father and I had enough of it(after the millionth comment of how miserably hot it is) we tell her we are leaving. Now we get to listen to complaints about how she didn't get to see her favorite animal, how long of a walk it is back to the front, how her water is still too warm and now her shoes are now uncomfortable. 

I try to acknowledge her complaints but not feed into them. I don't jump to fix every problem and we have explained to her how the constant complaining makes everyone unhappy. Sometimes I feel like she just complains so she can hear the sound of her own voice because most of the time the complaints are ridiculous. Like her complaining about her shoes being uncomfortable, the shoes in question are new running Nikes that fit her very well and she said previously are very comfortable. 

I have gotten to the point where I don't like taking her places with me because I know she will find something that makes her unhappy. I recently left her behind when I went fishing with my dad. She was upset about not going, but I knew she would only want to be there for 30 minutes, and my father and I would get to listen about how hot it was, how its too muddy, how bored she is, there is too many bugs ect. 

I want to do things with her, but she just makes me want to pull my hair out. The complaining gives me anxiety and I know it makes everyone around us either upset or annoyed. I also don't want her to always be looking for the negative and being the person that's excluded from fun things because of it. 

So my question is how do I get her to stop with the constant complaints? What can I and her father do to help curb this behavior? 

Also, there is nothing wrong with her like sensory issues or health problems. She is a very normal, healthy girl."
awilliams123,2021-04-27 22:15:17+00:00,I hate the food fights,"My kid ruins every meal. Doesn’t matter what it is, could be taco night, could be chicken nuggets, could be turkey dinner, she literally sucks the joy
out of every meal by complaining and fidgeting, and making a gigantic mess of her plate, getting up every 2 minutes to ‘pee’ or ‘oh look a squirrel!’
I am sick to death of it. She hates every food and is usually still sat at the table in front of her food long after everyone else has had enough of her shit and long gone, and then I am stuck trying to negotiate the rest of her meal down her face.
I can’t make a simple enough meal for her. I want to just exclude her from mealtime, because it’s just too agonizing. She is 5, and I realize she is still so very young, but these days everything is 3x as hard as it was before this covid shit and I’m out of gas.
I just needed to rant after making a fabulous meal for the family and being left with nothing but rage because of her. She is lovely all other times. I just don’t want to fucking feed her anymore.

End of rant. This felt good."
bluelinebrotha,2021-04-27 22:08:38+00:00,"Issues with shyness, wetting pants and the bed","My son, who is 6, is a very, very quiet kid in public. He's very shy and won't usually engage with people at all.

&amp;#x200B;

He is by all accounts, a ""mama's boy"" and must at all times be physically attached to his mother. Either by hugging, hanging off her leg, or in the same general vicinity unless he's playing with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

At school he will pee himself because he's too afraid to ask his teacher to go to the bathroom. He will also hold in his poop and have accidents during sleep. He's afraid to make friends and often tells me he sits alone at recess and ""doesn't have any friends""

&amp;#x200B;

At night, it has been a nightmare. He goes down fine but every night he either pees or poops in his bed. There is nothing we can do stop this other than putting a pull-up on him. The room smells awful as you can imagine and it's very hard to keep clean.

&amp;#x200B;

The other problem we have is that he is emotional and cries about...everything. A paper cut, you'd assume was the surgical removal of his finger or a broken bone. If he doesn't get his way, total meltdown. If we want to go somewhere, total meltdown. If he is in a meltdown or you ask him about school, the meltdown continues and he gets angry and cries more that you asked him.

&amp;#x200B;

As a father I know I could be more available in his life. I work long hours and my wife usually takes care of them more than I do. I worry that his behavior now is solidified into his personality, and his immaturity will never improve. I've read countless stories about bed wetting, peaceful parenting, and kids being attached and afraid that they will lose their parents. None of the advice has worked and his behavior and meltdowns are getting so bad we are considering taking him to the doctors to see if they can refer us to a mental specialist. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are at wits end. My son is incredible SMART and in touch with the world. He is not autistic or special in any way, but he has some demons that he needs worked out. I don't want him to stay back a year and we may do tutoring to help him with reading and math this summer."

When he does stares at bright light bulbs or glances at the sun, I tell him to don't do that because it will damage his eyes. He does it anyway.

bumbaclotbae,2021-04-27 21:10:02+00:00,Can babies vomit on command?,"To me this sounds pretty ridiculous but my wife is trying to convince me that our 10-month old can vomit on command. Today he started coughing like he is choking and then started vomiting in the middle of his feed. She was feeding him solids - chicken and mashed potatoes. She claimed that's what he does when he doesn't like the food because he simply can't communicate that he doesn't like the food to her. I didn't question any further because these kind of discussions can quickly lead to heated arguments.  


 I get worried because I notice that she sometime feeds him, what to me, looks like large portions for the baby. I mean at the end of the day I know she knows what's best for our child because she handles everything and spends the majority of her time with him. She's done a fantastic job and I know there is no way I could compare as a parent but every time I question anything to do with the baby or the way she feeds him - the situation gets real sensitive and she gets super defensive and angry. Anyways I feel like the whole ""baby vomits when he doesn't like the food"" was just something she made up in order to hide the fact that maybe she's in the wrong on this one..."

It doesn't matter if my hair is tied back or not, she'll grab on and use my shirt or my hair to stand up, crawl on to me, crawl over me, or just because she can. There's been way too many times where she just leaps onto me and hangs onto my hair or shirt. There's no way to avoid this, I've never taught her it was okay. I've always said no and showed her where my hand is or my shoulder, and to do this instead. But ""no"" has always meant ""yes, do that quicker with more effort"". I am so uncomfortable in my own clothes, it's driving me insane. My toddler is 16 months, she's been doing this to me since she was 3 months. Help me, I just want to be comfortable 😭"

Ducklanding20,2021-04-27 20:28:29+00:00,My son has been acting odd at my parents house,"My son (1 year) and I had to move in with my father and his gf. My son has been around them countless times before for sleepovers and such and they are great with him (I think) and he’s usually always so excited to see them. Since we’ve moved though my son will not leave my side. He screams if I leave a room, just doesn’t want to be without me. Which I just assumed was a new phase that coincidentally happened at the same time as our move. But the second I dropped him off at me ex’s house he was fine and had no tears for missing mom. So I’m thinking okay, he must just miss his home and is adjusting to my parents. 

Today we went to visit my grandmother, and I had warned her beforehand not to take it personally if he acts standoffish/just wants mom. Well, the second we show up he’s all smiles, wants to cuddle her and play. He had never been to her house before either and all he wanted to do was explore, didn’t matter if I was present or not. 

Now growing up, my dad was always the good parent. He was very loving, not strict, has continued to be a great influence as my siblings and I have become adults, and was a complete 180 from my mom so I even have something to compare it to. So I cannot wrap my brain around this sudden reaction from my son. 

My initial mom instincts kick in and my brain goes to something must have happened that has caused my child some sort of trauma with them but the last time he was alone with them he seemed perfectly fine and normal when I picked him up and, honestly, that would mean I don’t know my parents. They’re the most loving and supportive people I know, example being that they’ve allowed my son and I to move in rent free until I get on my feet. 

So I’m just at a loss right now on what’s going on. He’s perfectly fine in any other house that we are in, I’m almost leaning towards my parents house being haunted. Like I can’t even go pee without him clinging to my leg which is so out of character. What can I do to make him more comfortable in our new temporary home?"

I’m wanting to try for another baby. But regarding my age and the fact I’m still in university has garnered comments along the lines of ‘throwing my ambition and goals away to child rear, while only having 2 years of study to go.’

Why do some people (mostly non parents) assume you can’t complete goals during pregnancy/ life with young kids. Since having my baby I’ve managed do full time uni, with no help other than husband and daycare, and also gain a part time job.

myblasphemouslife,2021-04-27 19:30:36+00:00,Tween yrs coming up and I'm not ready,"My only child is 10 and while he's still very much a happy playful young kid, I know soon he will be a moody teenager and I know I'm not ready. I guess I'm just worried he won't be the same easygoing, loving kid he has always been since he was born. I'm worried he will change suddenly and drastically, and im worried I won't know what to do, being so used to how easygoing he has always been. 

It's worth mentioning he's also special needs and maturity wise he is closer to a 7yr old. He's a sweet child and he really doesn't have any behavioral issues. I'm just worried puberty will be like a behavioral light switch for him and if so I'm worried I won't know what to do or how best to handle it. 

I guess I'm just curious about anyone else's experiences. If other parents here had kids that were easygoing from the start only to become nightmares upon hitting puberty and how they managed that. Or if it didn't seem to change their easygoing demeanor."

She sleeps in her bed all night and is potty trained but won’t let anyone else put her to bed but me. She spends one night each week with her paternal grandparents and sleeps with her grandmother, since they don’t have a separate area for her to sleep there. 

I’m a stay at home mom and she spends most of her time with me. Dad works long hours five days a week and has the weekends off. We’ve just barely gotten her used to me leaving alone on the weekend so she can spend time with dad but bedtime is still difficult.

The girl was telling Tia how her dog had died last night. My kind, sensitive and filled with empathy daughter says to the mourning little girl, ""why don't you get a gun and kill yourself.""

WTF? Seriously. I don't know where this comes from, (well I possibly do, probably the internet?) but her mother and I NEVER speak like that.  And she LOVES animals (no she's not abusing them) which makes it all the stranger. 

This is pretty out there and extreme but, my question is: Tia has two rats that she truly loves. In order to teach her some empathy, I was thinking about either telling her in the car on the way home from school that her rats had died. Or just not saying anything at all on the way home, put the rats up at a friends house, and either telling her they died or not really saying anything at all just telling her they're gone and that's it. Or legitimately giving her pets away as punishment.

I am more than happy that my child enjoys time with daddy but also wonder if I should make an effort to be more  outgoing. However it doesn't really come naturally to me and I also can't help to make sure that things work as they should (hygiene, meals, bed time etc...).

I try to be there for her whenever she reaches out to me. I would really love to be there for her now in person but I am exhausted. This is not the first time she has asked to come last minute. I should add that she somehow manages to bring up my mother and other family members who are happy to host her on short notice so this of course presses my buttons triggering a deep seated sense of inadequacy (yes I've had years of therapy). I should add that she is fully vaccinated but my husband is awaiting his second and I am scheduled for my first. She knows we dont spend extended time indoors with anyone outside our pod. We do not have a spare room so when she visited in the past we gave her our master bedroom and we sleep on the floor in the living room.

It has been like this for en entire year, and my son hasn’t showed any sign of it being something he has a problem with until a week or two ago. On nights when my husband is home to do our big family hug (that’s essentially the only difference between solo nights and joint nights) and kiss him goodnight, he gets into bed without argument and smiles at us and calmly watches us leave the room and goes to sleep. Lately, on “solo” nights, I will hug and kiss him and put him in bed, and he immediately chases me to the door when i try to leave the room. I generally go back into the room and read him a book if he’s too upset, or sometimes take him to my bed to watch an episode of his favorite show and then put him back in bed, but after about 20 minutes of humoring him, I just have to put him in bed and leave the room. He will stand right inside of the door and scream at the top of his lungs, sometimes for 15 seconds and then go back to bed and go right to sleep, sometimes longer. I don’t understand the change in behavior, bedtime used to go very smoothly whether his dad was home or not. Nothing about our routine has changed. I’m at a loss."
lauren_91,2021-04-27 15:56:25+00:00,What's Your Schedule Like?,"I have a 15mo and just started a new job. My schedule is much more rigid than my last job and since our son hasn't been in daycare yet due to the pandemic, I feel like I don't know how to make a schedule around my work.

Right now my in-laws help and he will be going to daycare soon, but I am wondering if anyone was willing to share their schedules with younger kids?

When do you and them wake up? When is breakfast? When are your drop-off and pick-up times from childcare? When is dinnertime? What do you do between dinner and bedtime? When is bedtime for them and you? Do you offer a bedtime snack? What chores do you do at night or in the morning to be ready for the day?

Thanks so much!"

me and my fiancé are totally okay if she works for now while I stay at home with my son. 
he clings on to me then anybody (for now!) he wants me before wanting anybody else. it’s been like that since he was 6 months or so. he just loves his dad and just has a preference. 
i get the idea that when I tell someone I’m a stay at home dad I’m “lazy” or “don’t want to work” but no that’s not the case. I love working, I love the outside world lol. we just want our son to be home with one of his parents for now. 

i can now take him out for walks, go to the park, fun outside activities as it gets warm ( I live In Wisconsin) 
I just enjoy interacting with him and being in his presence.

Our daughters nursery asked what they want us to focus on in the coming months.

I was wondering what other peoples opinions were on whether she has a point?"

I don’t have any kids yet but my spouse and I are starting to more seriously consider conceiving.  My spouse has depression and panic disorder.  I’m nervous about how having a child could impact their mental health, and I am scared to tell them that because it feels cruel.  I’m also nervous about how it will impact my own mental health, and everything I’ve been reading is just saying “the well parent just picks up the slack”.  Is it so selfish of me to be scared of that?  I obviously want to support my spouse, and I want them to experience being a parent, and of course I would be there to do my fair share of things.... but I’m still really anxious about what that will look like.

I've noticed it get smaller, but now it's gotten to a point where it's hardened and won't shrink anymore. I got a referral to a neurologist and after a CT scan he's recommended surgery stating that bone has hardened over the bump (essentially the lump over his skull has now been covered by more bone). The doctor is saying w/o surgery the lump will never go away.. hesitantly, I've scheduled surgery...

I don't want him growing up with a sizeable lump on his head, but with surgery there will be a permanent scar across his head. All of this is very frustrating for me because this is my first and only child and I'm trying to make the best decision for him. Has anyone heard of any outcomes/solutions outside of surgery?

Currently I have him every Thursday after work to Sunday night around 7pm. Once school starts in August I will have him Sunday night to Friday after work and she will have him on the weekends.

And WHEN??? 😭 My feisty 4 year old is certainly much more mature than he was at 3 years old (3 was brutal!) but he still has a long ways to go. He just gets so mad and cranky sometimes! We’ve tried every parenting tip in the book, have worked with professionals (he has anxiety, selective mutism, and “gifted” (school’s words) intelligence), and we’re honestly just at a complete loss. He is such a sensitive kid who feels his emotions very strongly which is good on the sweet side of things (he’s so loving, empathetic, and kind) and bad on the other side of things (he can be so grumpy, irritable, bossy, unreasonable, etc.) It’s like his sensitivity is a blessing and a curse at this age. He’ll be 5 soon and I’m hoping there will be some more significant improvement next year. He wants so badly to do the right thing but when he gets upset in the moment, it’s like he just can’t control his emotions at all and all his progress goes right out the window. Some days, he is a delight! Other days, it’s like he wakes up on the wrong side of the bed and is moody all damn day. On those days, every little thing sets him off. I guess it’s better than when he was 3 and every day was a challenge. But it’s still very tough, especially lately when the moody days are far outweighing the good days. We’ve got a baby at home who’s going through a clingy phase and it’s just all very overwhelming right now. Does it ever get easier / better?"

I have a good rapport with her step dad too. My daughter is usually with me on the weekends and at mom's during the week, although lately with covid, she's been over during the week some too. My problem is that my daughter often misbehaves and is disrespectful and mean when she's at mom's house. She is always super chill when she's with me and I rarely, if ever, have to get on her about stuff. She's got two half-sisters at mom's house that are younger. They're both hyper and loud and my daughter, especially being a teenager now, can't stand them. Her mom is also not a neat and tidy person. Her house is always a disaster. It's not unsanitary, but there's always crap everywhere. That house is extremely chaotic whereas mine is quiet and peaceful. It's not like she's on vacation when she's with me though. She has chores, school work, etc. I think she's just miserable a lot of the time that she's at mom's house, causing her to act out or be in a foul mood. I'm not really sure how to deal with this. I don't want to offend her mom or stepdad by implying that these issues are their fault exclusively, but I really feel like they need to take a step back and realize that they promote a chaotic and stressful environment at their house. They aren't bad parents by any means. My daughter is well taken care of. But this bad behavior is getting worse and worse. And now stepdad is texting me all the time that I need to come get her. They're also well aware that we don't have these issues at my house. Does anyone have any tips on how to approach this situation? I'm at a loss. My daughter says sometimes that she wants to live with me all the time but I know for sure that she doesn't mean it. Thanks for reading."

One day I'm going to come downstairs and he simply won't be with us anymore.  I'm an adult, I'm mentally prepared for it to happen, but after 18 years, I know I'm going to be broken up.

Our son has ""tv"" knowledge of death, he's sees characters die in movies and will say ""he's dead"" or something of that sort, but, hey, the next time we watch it, he's back, so he clearly doesn't understand the permanence of it.

I will never lie, that cat isn't going to live on a farm somewhere or any hogwash like that.

What we like/love: orange slices, strawberry, arrowroot cookies, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, lightly seasoned ribs, eggs.

What we have an okay relationship with: broccoli (is hit or miss depending on the day, white rice, yellow rice, apple slices (green apples), French fries.

What we despise: mashed potatoes (he still hates them and will actively get mad at you if you trick him into trying it again lol), pineapple (same as mashed potatoes), kiwi.

His absolute favorites right now are mango slices (he’ll try to shove the whole thing down his throat so you have to watch him like a hawk), the arrowroot cookies (he has quite a few teeth so it think it’s the chewing factor), and he still really enjoys bananas on occasion.

It’s hilarious to watch him make faces at things he doesn’t like! Mashed potatoes still produces the same result and the same look of absolute betrayal that is priceless. He liked sauerkraut better! What are some notable reactions your littles have had to foods???"

My husband had my son (21 month old) for the first two days and my mom had him for the last day. When I came back, my son was so happy to see me he latched onto me like a koala in a tree, but shortly after that moment, he was throwing tantrums left and right, crying over everything for seemingly no reason. Woke up this morning and it’s been the same thing, just non-stop crying. He won’t even eat his breakfast because he’s too busy screaming, and he’s a good eater, he also angrily threw his sippy cup at me, which he’s never done.

My husband and mom said they could tell he missed me, but he didn’t act like that the entire time I was gone, so I’m assuming a lot of this behavior is attention seeking or due to stress or something. He’s also not one to throw tantrums often, he’s a pretty chill little guy. I’ve been away from him before, but not for three days, so I wonder if he’s mad at me? Anyway I took the CDC’s advice and have been ignoring the tantrums, but I honestly don’t know if I can stand the noise much longer. I fear that this is just going to be another full day of screaming and I don’t know what to do. I want him to calm down and eat so that we can both enjoy the day. Advice?"

username10661914,2021-04-27 13:16:14+00:00,My 16 year old wants to move to italy,"A few years ago he discovered his talent for dance. Long story short, he’s been recruited to attend a dance school in Bologna, Italy

His immediate reaction was very positive and excited. I’ve told him he’d be leaving his family (he’s very close to us and his siblings) and his friends, plus he doesn’t speak Italian, but he’s still adamant that he’s going to go

The thought of him alone in a country who’s language he can’t even speak terrifies me. And while his ability to make friends exceeds the rest of the families, I have no idea how independent he is. On top of that, I know these school are incredibly tough, and I don’t want him to suffer more than he has to

Plus, rather selfishly, I’m going to miss him greatly. He’s the sweetest child, so expressive and such a good brother to the others (19m,18f,14f)

I know I’ll end up letting him because it’s what he wants and I trust him to make his own decisions but it’s not sitting right with me at the moment

Also, how safe is a career in dance? I don’t want him to end up jobless in his 30s. We have a friends who owns a big dance studio and she offered him a job but my son says he’ll never fancy doing that because of the mountains of admin"

As much as I have been wanting another, my husband and I resolved to adopt since my first pregnancy was an absolute nightmare. If things run a similar course, I will not be capable of caring for my (almost) 2 year old right around the 6 month mark. 

I’m feeling so guilty about this. He doesn’t deserve to have mommy sick like that. We had previously been rocking him to sleep still since we weren’t planning on starting the adoption process for a couple more years- so why put him through the trauma of sleep training? Now we know that we need to, and have started to gently try- but as any parent knows, there’s nothing that feels ‘gentle’ about it. New baby is due just before Christmas, so I feel guilty that we’re ruining Christmas for him. All around I just plain feel guilty. I’ve always been someone who has felt that there’s very little excuse for unplanned pregnancy since birth control options are so plenty. Guess I’m eating my words now! Or eating my thoughts I guess, I’ve never shared that shitty judgement with anyone before really. He’s still nursing, so I’ve started to wean him as well, which has been pretty hard on him. I’m pretty much dried up now and he’s very frustrated with losing that source of comfort. 

Ugh. Parents, tell me how having number 2 went for you. How did your first react? How did you help with the transition? What can his dad and I do to make this as positive of an experience as possible?"

Magicsurroundings,2021-04-27 12:07:37+00:00,The power of the sticky note,"So like so many parents,  I’ve been struggling for a while. I have a 13 month old and a 3.5 year old, and was working from home with no help for 7 months into covid- until I got laid off. My husband sold his soul to USPS so he is rarely home these days. 

My 3.5 has been testing me to the extreme for months. I am not proud to say I have lost my cool and yelled multiple times. I have lingering PPD and have had a hard time regulating my emotions over the course of the year. Some days just feel really hard. Anyway- I knew I needed to change asap.

It’s not a perfect solution and there are still things I need to work on- but sticky notes around the house have been extremely helpful for me. It’s also kind of cheesy and I felt a little silly putting them up but 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

I tried to use some gentle parenting mantras that I resonated with. Simple things like “bring the calm”, “I am in charge of staying calm, no matter how my child behaves”, “all feelings are okay”. I put them in places where tantrums/stubbornness tend to happen most- for us that’s the kitchen and around my 3.5 year olds bedroom. 

I’ve been doing this for a week and have not yelled once. When I feel overwhelmed in the moment- I look to a sticky note and repeat the mantra before addressing my child. That’s a huge improvement for me. Yelling is just not who I am, it’s not what my kids need or deserve. Before covid I was not like this and I’m ready to move on.

Im sharing this partly for me, to mark my progress. But I’m also interested to see is anyone has other sayings they like to remember in times of tension with toddlers? Or parenting podcast recommendations? I usually have a podcast on during the day and feel one specific to parenting could help too.

We try console her but it just doesn’t work, the only way she stops is if mom picks her up and lets her lay on top of her. She won’t accept me or accept sleeping next to us, she has to be on her mom. 

This is affecting our sleep and has take a toll on both of us. We don’t know what to do. 

Has anyone gone through this? Any advice? Whenever I look online I get night terror as the culprit, but she stops immediately after her mom picks her up and lays on her.

Beastmodexxlsixty9,2021-04-27 07:15:55+00:00,A hurting father!,"I have wanted to post something like this for a while but it's hard putting my thoughts and feelings into sentence form.

M/51, father of 2 teen boys. My ex wife left me almost 13 years ago. We lived together for 5.5 years and then were married for about 6.5 years.

We were very happy and never fought until the last 2 years of our marriage.  There was no infidelity,  no substance abuse, no physical abuse or mental. 

Long story short we failed each other. We couldn't seem to get on the same page anymore and found ourselves fumbling and not being able to understand where each other was coming from or what we needed from each other.

With a month of planning and help from her family she emptied out our house a d nearly everything it it while I was working a 7am to 7pm shift.

Fast forward to the hear and now. My kids live with there mom. Her and I are civil and even celebrate birthdays and Christmas together purely for our kids.

The problem is that when my oldest was 6 he was dealing with his own issues that sadly most probably have when there parents split. He had separation anxiety and it was very difficult for him when his mom dropped him off at school. There were times he didn't want to see me and at the age of 6 his mom stood in front of a family court judge who gave a ruling that if he didn't want to come spend time with me he didn't have to and I could t make him but also if he did want to his mother couldn't stop him.

So basically I've seen him without his mother present about 2 times in the last ten years. You might be thinking I'm leaving something out, there has to be a reason he won't see you. Some form of abuse, neglect, or something but I swear there was none of that.  

I'm a good loving supportive father who would die for his children. His 14 year old brother has spent every weekend for nearly 12 plus years with me. We are extremely close and I just want to the with his brother who's now 16.

I've had some heart to hearts with my oldest. He knows he can talk to me about anything. I've tried for years to spend time with him and I've exhausted myself mentally trying to figure out why he won't see me. I've asked his mother but she says she doesn't know.

If I text his younger brother I get a reply almost instantly but with his brother I get a reply about 1 out of 10 times I reach out to him. He knows where to find me when he wants a ride or new sneakers but he won't come over or go out with me or even talk on the phone.

I hurt every day because of this and I know if the boys had lived with me all this time there is no way I would allow them the choice of whether they want to see there mom or not. A 6 year old shouldn't be given that choice. It also hurts that she never tries to encourage him to see me.

She knows I'm a good dad and a good person. She knows she can trust me and despite past hurts and heartbrake we do our best to co-parent.

I'm just at a loss. I never wanted this for my family. I never could of imagined how everything has turned out and most of all having a son who shows no interest in being a part of my life 9r me in his.  I need advise or encouragement or something? 

Thanks if you've made it this far."
sethro919,2021-04-27 07:04:17+00:00,My (37m) ex wife (36f) told my son (9m) that I wouldn’t want him full time.,"TL:DR at the bottom.

My ex and I have been co-parenting since 2014c and for the most part have had a good relationship. We are both remarried, my wife is very involved in the co-parenting, her husband is not. 

Tonight my ex texts my wife that our oldest is grounded because he threw her iPad and broke it. She then texts “he said he wants to live with you guys full time. And in anger/humor I said ‘Honey Dad doesn’t want you full time lol.” My wife told her that is not the case. Ex responded “I know, he said it to hurt my feelings, I can’t let a nine year old win.” Then told my wife to, “stop taking everything so seriously.”

My son has already indicated that he has resentment towards my ex because of how she left (bailed in the middle of the night) and had many several comments to his brother about it. 

My wife and I get my sons tomorrow and already have a plan on how to talk to him and reassure him that we love him and would absolutely have them with us 24/7. However, I have no idea how to address my ex and let her know just how messed up what she said was, and how inappropriate it was for her to tell my son that I wouldn’t want him.

Any advise would be appreciated, thanks.

TL:DR. My son told his mom, my ex wife, during a fight he wanted to live with me full time. Ex told him I wouldn’t want him full time. I’m pissed and need help with how to address it with her."

dita_von_toes,2021-04-27 05:54:42+00:00,14-month-old formula intake increased?,"Hi everyone! I have a 14-month-old baby girl. I pumped breast milk  and supplemented with formula until about 8 months, at which point I switched to exclusive formula. 

Around when she turned 12 months, I started tapering off her formula intake at the doctor’s suggestion. The doctor said to aim to decrease intake to about 500ml (~17oz) around 12 months, and she was doing well on just about 300-400ml, sleeping through the night which she has done since about 7-8 months.

However, a few weeks ago she had her first cold, and after this her formula intake spiked again. She started waking up sometimes at night to drink more formula, and started needing the late night feed again, which I had already dropped previously. She’s also possibly teething and learning to walk.

I’m curious what your experiences are, and if it seems normal that a baby her age would taper off formula and then need/want it again? She eats a lot of solid foods though her appetite can vary sometimes. Her weight at 12 months was 85th percentile (just under 24 lbs).

And also, how exactly does one go about more deliberately decreasing formula intake? I’ve googled this but there are so many different instructions online, not sure which is really the right way to go.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you!"

Sometimes them wanting to talk to me seems like too much work and I end up zoning out. I feel like complete crap because of it. I know a huge part of it is my phone and I’m trying to quit that but just playing with my children and talking to them sometimes feels like a huge chore. I love my children and I take care of their basic needs and cuddle with them and love on them. I guess I just want advice on how to be present with them and stop zoning out when they’re talking and find more enjoyment when playing with them."

I didn't think much of  it since he's very independent. My wife was working in the room next to his and on her way out she noticed that my son was grabbing his butt area with his undies down. She was weirded out since it's the first time she saw this behavior and told me about it. Throughout the day my son would go into his room and I would follow him very quietly to see what he would do. One time I saw he was putting a small monster truck ramp against his butt (again with his undies down) and another time (this really shocked me) he got a toy screwdriver, he was about to insert it down the middle of his butt cheeks and I made some noice so he would stop. Every time I caught him doing something with his butt he would cover his face with his hands, like if she was ashamed and run into the living room. Is this normal behavior or should I be concerned? Anyone else experiencing something similar with their kids? Any advise helps. Thanks for taking the time to read this, good day."
mikethereddit,2021-04-27 05:34:45+00:00,Youtube has been great for my kid (6M),"I was generally opposed to the mindless surfing he wanted to do. But he's obsessed with animals, and he was learning animal facts from the videos, so supervised searching became ok. Then I noticed he was learning to spell a lot of words so he could search for stuff. Then since the animal comparison videos all reference Usain Bolt when discussing top human speed, he started learning about the Olympics and the various track and field events. The last 2 days he's been drawing dozens of pictures in honor of Jackie Joyner Kersee, who he considers a queen because she jumps the highest and the farthest and runs fastest too. I don't really know why that's changed my stance, just that I never would have thought to introduce him to famous track athletes but Youtube knew what would spark his imagination.  Still not unsupervised,  but I'm impressed and wanted to share - Youtube definitely can lead a kid down a bad path to inappropriate stuff, but it can also open up new worlds. Probably that's obvious to many but I was surprised."

octoberelectrocute,2021-04-27 04:36:25+00:00,Is my child's drawing disturbing? (x-posted to r/askatherapist),"I already have my 5 year old son in therapy to deal with the trauma of my Dad's death and his father not being in his life due to addiction. His drawings are usually happy and creative but today he drew a drawing of my Dad dead. The level of detail he drew indicates my Mom told him more than he should know such as the fact that he was cremated wearing an Arkansas Razorbacks shirt under his funeral suit. We personally thought it was kind of funny the way he drew a cartoonish caricature of death with crosses for eyes and his tongue sticking out. He also drew an Arkansas Razorback on his shirt. I sent it to my Dad's sister and she got upset and thought it was disturbing. I intend to take it to his therapist but the fact that I wasn't that concerned makes me wonder if we just have a dark sense of humor as medical people or we just have a healthy idea of how a child should process death. Here is the link to the drawing.

Fistina_Aguilera,2021-04-27 04:18:07+00:00,Helping to deal with death of Grandpa,"Sorry for the text barrage;
My wife recently( a week ago)  lost her father to COVID.  About 2 weeks before, her favorite cat died, an absolute cuddle monster that has been with us through a really rough road. The loss was hard on my wife especially, because the beginning of April is the anniversary of our son's birth and one week later the same for his death. And this cat was her source of comfort through that and a series of losses.


Our daughter (31 months) understands that he is brother, she knows his pictures and that he's sleeping in his NICU incubator.  She understands his importantce to mommy and daddy and that him not being here makes us sad and that we miss him very much.  She's come up to me and said ""me miss me brother, don't be sad anymore dada"", gave me a hug patting me on the back.


She also has grasped the loose concept of them both being gone somewhere else and that kitty is cuddling with brother.


She knew grandpa was sick and at the doctors and even got to video chat with him two nights before he died and he looked good, they said I love yous and laughed.  She was at my parents and I went to take our daughter to my wife and Nana and explain what happened.  His name was never mentioned at my parent's, it was general wife's dad, or him and the word death was never used explicitly, which was intentional to have the discussion with my wife present.  From knowing he was sick and in the hospital, that people were at the hospital saying goodbye, were sad, and him being gone, she pieced together that he died.

I buckled her in and she looks at me and says momma, daddy said, no more grandpa,  grandpa gone now, grandpa die.  I was shocked that she pieced that together and we get to nanas and she tells them both she has hugs and kisses for them to not be sad anymore.  We were relieved things were going well with her understanding; until they didn't.

Shes had nightmares every night that we finally found out were about his car being there, but him not and that it made her upset and wants cuddles.  I tried letting her sit in it to help the anxiety and she keeps using the term 'lost' for him.  I think maybe she thinks he's missing and can't find his car?  But she also knows, and can use: right and right, to-too-two, and nail(finger)-nail(metal fastener)

Now she's terrified of being alone at Nana's or even being with Nana alone.  Today she was and wouldn't let her touch her, change her diaper, go for a walk once she saw his car.  She just sat there watching Nanas iPad for hours and the only response was me sad, me miss grandpa.  Obviously we all feel awful, because she just needs her granddaughter and its not happening.  We're going to try a few day break from seeing her, but if that doesn't help, im at a loss.  Maybe she just needs time to process.



And I hear her crying as I write this.
Anyone have any suggestions?"
mosh_java,2021-04-27 04:17:30+00:00,What i should have done?,"Today afternoon i was collecting my daughter (3.8 old) from the Montessori. And i was waiting outside for here, then he teacher came up with a form and telling me there was an incident with my daughter being hit another kid and the head using a TOY and she had a small bump but she is fine and nothing is serious.

The other kid: is a girl that has a special need (not sure what issue she has, but she has a special teacher all the time with her and the girl is really active an aggressive sometimes), my daughter told me before that she got scared of her before because she never leave a kid enjoying eating sweets by themselves).
Anyway.

The form was explaining the incident and i have to sign that i was i informed.

I signed as all i care that she is fine and i understand that you cannot blame kids from that age and i want my kid to understand not everything around is all the time nice.

Then my daughter came out, she looked fine but when i asked here about the incident she told me that girl hit her on the head with a mop, and we arrived home she went to the mop we have she told me: like this one.

After this i got sad, like what i have should done? Should i have reacted differently to the teacher?! That feeling of im not protecting her is eating me."
HeadIncident,2021-04-27 04:09:41+00:00,Is it weird to give my teen our old bed?,"So my husband and I are talking about getting a new mattresses for our kids. My daughter would get a new one, but my 17 year old son expressed an interest in having mine and my husbands old bed because his current mattress is a full and mine is a cal king. There is nothing really wrong with my cal king mattress except I am a plus size person and so it is kinda worn down where I sleep. This way my husband and I get a new mattress and my teen gets a bigger bed. I see this as a win-win. 

Here’s the issue is my husband thinks it is totally weird for our son to use our old bed because we have had sex on it and doesn’t want to give it to him. I think he is making it weird by making a big deal out of our kid sleeping somewhere where we’ve had sex.

What do you think Reddit?"
sadboicollective,2021-04-27 03:51:51+00:00,How do I build up my son without putting a load on his shoulders,"I know we all think our kids are geniuses and can do whatever they set their mind to. 
But for me growing up with all my family saying I was ""super smart"" or "" you'll do great things when you grow up"" i felt a huge burden on me as a teen/ young adult to the point of depression, especially when I had to drop out of high school to support my mom and sister. And realizing I am of average intelligence at best. 
I would support any career choice my son (who is barely 2 now) and life style he chooses. However I feel inclined to praise him and pump him up the way my family did (out of habit I guess) but i don't want to burden him the same way I was.
Any resources you guys may have about positive reinforcement that doesn't make him feel i expect ""greatness"" from him, just to do his utmost best at everything he does.

I have a four week old baby and in the last week my almost 2 year old son refuses to go to bed at night. It’s almost 11pm and he’s been kicking and screaming and crying for hours. He’s okay if I hold him but as soon as he’s put back in his bed it’s like he’s being murdered. I’m legitimately surprised the cops or CPS haven’t shown up to my house for a welfare check. Is this normal? Is this just some awful stage I have to wait out? Is there a way to help him get through whatever he is dealing with right now? I’m sure the addition of the baby is probably making all of his emotions project differently but I am at my wits end.
ssaskcab,2021-04-27 03:41:02+00:00,Stubborn tempered 20mo baby driving us insane!,"This may be more of a vent than anything but does anyone have any advice about how to deal with a head strong stubborn 20mo toddler? And none of this annoying ""just distract"" or ""redirect"" crap because that never works on him.

So he's our first child and has been pretty isolated growing up due to covid lock down so mostly only sees us and his grandparents predominantly so I believe it has stunted both his language and behavioral development. We try to teach him the best we can but my wife and I work full 40hr weeks and don't know if we're doing things right. He just only recently went back to daycare but the problems we have with him has only seem to have heightened when he comes home probably because he's stressed at the new environment and vents when he gets home. 

The problem we have with him is predominantly getting him to try expressing his thoughts more. We've heard him speak about 10-20 different words but he gives up so easily when we try to teach him words and has a temper that can get ignited over the littlest thing and would become fixated on it. Daycare says he's a good eater but we're skeptical cause every meal time has him throwing food away and never eating what we feed him except for the few items he likes. And what he likes is just carbs and sometimes proteins. 

When he's playing, fed, and in good spirits he's lovely. But the problems are when he he gets annoyed and frustrated with whatever. Times he would want a toy or object that we can't give to him and that will trigger a tantrum and no matter what other toy or snack or etc we give to him as a redirect he'll throw away repeatedly. Sometimes the tantrum starts cause he throw something away and he wants it back. We're trying to teach him to not throw things if he wants it so we don't give it back to him especially when it's meal time. 

It's come to the point where everytime he cries about anything and everything it's just like nails on a chalkboard and it both infuriates us and annoys us that he can't seem to progress to expressing or at the very least ATTEMPT to try express what he wants aside from pointing and groaning. He cries so often now that we honestly cannot tell when he's legitimately feeling ill.

I would characterize myself as a patient man while my wife is a hot head. But honestly I am at my wits end. I don't know if this is normal nor how to make this better for him or my wife and to ensure he doesn't become some sociopath. Sometimes I think we're hostage to him and he's torturing us with his consistent meltdowns every single day. It's gotten to the point where a day free of a meltdown is a godsend. I feel guilt for actually wanting to neglect him when he's crying for the 15th min straight of the 6th meltdown that day, but what am I to do?!"

Delllthrow,2021-04-27 02:57:07+00:00,Mother who's teenager (17M) is making money but completely unmotivated in school.,"During the lockdown, my teenage son became very adept and passionate about investing and sports betting, while also making a very substantial amount of money--over 100k since the pandemic started. However, he has since shown no motivation in school. He started off the school year getting A's and B's but has since deteriorated into not even bothering to hand in assignments that will take any considerable amount of time and does not seem to care about his grades at all. Just last week he received a 42 on a calculus test because he couldn't be bothered to pay attention at all during class or even attempt to learn any of the material. Keep in mind, he has had a 3.9-4.0 gpa throughout high school and scored a 35 on his first and only attempt on the ACT. He claims he has no interest in going to college, but I believe he is being severely shortsighted. My husband and I have the ability to pay for all of his college tuition, and he has the ability to go to a very selective college. How does he know he won't find something he truly loves doing and is passionate about in college? For what it's worth, he does understand he is very lucky he wouldn't have to take out loans, worry about finances in college, etc., but has often told me to ""save my money"" and just let him forgo a college education. I also believe he will become lazy and aimless without a real job when he becomes an adult if he doesn't go to college. My husband thinks he is basically an adult who can support himself and should be allowed to make his own decisions, but it pains me to allow him just to basically drop out of school when he so obviously has a lot of potential. I have thought about essentially forcing him to put forth more effort in school and go to college, but I have very little leverage and do not doubt he would move out immediately when he turns 18 if I did, as he has shown willingness to spend time (days/weeks) away from home before as a result of my frustration and anger directed at him due to his lack of effort and commitment in school. What can I do?"
scarabic,2021-04-27 02:34:37+00:00,My wife and I disagree about how much leash is safe to give the kids.,"I won’t say we live in a safe neighborhood because I understand there is nowhere in the world that is completely safe. But to the extent that you can live somewhere that is *more* safe, we do. It’s a sleepy, affluent town of 60k people, a large share of them retirees. I grew up here and we’ve been here about 8 years.

My wife, however, lives in what I consider a state of fear. I don’t even question her rule that our kids aren’t allowed to go to the park at the end of our block on their own. We have a 9 and 5yo and things came to a head this week because I installed a swing in our front yard (where the good tree branch is) but my wife told the kids they cannot play on it unless mom or dad are out there watching them. 

When I protested that not being able to play in our own front yard was too restrictive, she rattled off a litany of “multiple incidents of child trafficking” which have taken place in our community.  When I asked for details, it all boiled down to someone in a car tried to talk to some kids at some point. I don’t dismiss it, but neither do I think we live in a hub of human trafficking, and I don’t want to set my kids’ boundaries for life based on the fact that thanks to the wonders of Nextdoor and our PD Facebook page, we now hear about every single crime incident that occurs anywhere in our municipality.

We are kind of stuck because I don’t think she will ever allow either of them to ride their bike three blocks to visit a friend’s house, and it seems a horribly constrained and limited childhood to me.

I grew up under the “come home before dark” set of rules right here in this community (actually over in the more rough neighboring town, which is still itself pretty sleepy). Crime statistics were much higher all those decades ago. And I’m sure I saw a car roll by and pass a few words with us while we were out playing. None of that was reason to huddle indoors. I’m fine with my kids being much safer than I was but being unable to play on the yard while we are all home... that was too much.

When I asked my wife to put these reported incidents in some kind of perspective, she was outraged and asked how many incidents of human trafficking I needed to take things seriously. I asked whether it was appropriate to keep an eye out for a few weeks after such an incident, or if we had to keep our kids indoors forever. 

Clearly neither of us is looking at this right. How do you navigate this?"
mustbethedragon,2021-04-27 02:30:08+00:00,Gaslighting vs disagreeing?,"My 15 yo daughter has accused me several times of gaslighting her. I'm really struggling to get perspective with this. When I disagree with her or set a boundary, she throws this at me, and I'm really trying to check my actions. I want to understand better what gaslighting means, and I need help taking apart my thoughts about our interactions. 

Example: She went to her boyfriend's Friday evening. I asked her when she was coming home, and she responded 10:30. I texted twice when she was late, then called at 11:15 to see where she was. Her reasoning was that she meant she would leave their house at 10:30 (which would still make her late, but whatever) not be home at 10:30. This makes at least the third or fourth time she's been late or he's been late leaving here, always with an explanation as to why it shouldn't count (his sister bailed, his mom fell asleep, misunderstanding).

She just now asked if she could see him this week since she'll be gone over the weekend. I told her that there would be a clear time that I expected her home and a consequence for being late. She got mad, saying there was a good reason for every time she was late. I responded that it's been a consistent pattern ever since she started hanging out with him a few weeks ago. She accused me again of gaslighting her because we didn't agree on what ""coming home at 10:30"" meant and because I ""cut her off"" when she wanted to go through ALL the explanations again (which I have already listened to and there's no new info about).

Here's how I see this interaction:
I disagreed about the meaning of coming home at 10:30
I'm irritated at her repeatedly being late with preventable excuses
I feel like I'm the only one concerned whether she gets home on time
I've already heard her explanations 
I want to know that she'll be home when she says she will next time she goes to his house

My question: Am I gaslighting her? Where's the border between boundaries and gaslighting?"
NerdyDadGuy1981,2021-04-27 02:09:01+00:00,Please don't forget that Dads are co-parents too,"I don't know where else to put this so I guess I'll drop it here for anyone that might listen.

Without getting into detail, today was really tough and involved a medical emergency with one of our kids while they were at school.  I got there as fast as I could, before my wife, and the whole vibe was one of ""mom will be here soon to decide what we need to do next"" with me right in the room.

I calm my child down, give the info to the paramedics, ask for details about what happened, etc.  My wife gets there, we sort it out with the pediatrician and we're on our way.  Later on facebook she gets messages about how awesome a mom she is, how tough a day that must have been, etc.

Now, I know none of this is malicious or intentional.  The people at the school are awesome and I have nothing but respect.  And, I love that they support my wife... and they know her more so of course they're going to show that support compared to me who is only involved in school activities outside of the typical school day (my wife picks the up and drops them off so knows them better).

But, as a dad it still sucks a lot to go through something traumatic like today and not have a single person ask how you're doing or give any encouragement at all while watching my wife get comfort and support.  

When I talked to her about it she didn't have anything to say except ""I'm sorry..."".

Makes me feel like I'm doing thing wrong as a Dad.  So, please, don't forget about us too."

We all want to have fun, right? Please no name calling."" It continued, and then my son came in crying, and told me, ""Mama, you're not going to like this. I threw rocks at those boys. I got so mad! I was so frustrated! They hirt my feelings, Mama. They keep calling me names and being mean to me. And I threw rocks at them."" He had a time out, and I made him apologize. 

Fifteen minutes go by, some other neighbour kids come out (the upstairs neighbors of the house behind us). They get along with my son. For a while, I hear talking and giggling. But then I start to hear one of the other boys yell ,again,""You're a baby! You're a weirdo! Go away, baby! You idiot!"" And sure enough, my son comes inside crying and tells me he threw rocks again. So I grounded him for the night. I told him that I agreed that it was not nice of those boys to call him names, but that it was not okay to throw rocks at them. I told him he was grounded because he did it again after apologizing and saying he wouldn't do it again. I explained that, the biggest reason he was in trouble was because what he did was dangerous. 

Now, tonight, it happened again. He was outside for maybe ten minutes tops. He came inside, told me he threw rocks at the boys again because he wanted to play with his dump truck with them, and they said it was stupid and that he was stupid. I go outside to go get his truck after grounding him for the night, and the boys father said ""Can you not let your kid throw rocks at my boys? He almost him them!"" I said ""Yes, that's why he's coming inside, he's grounded for the night"" I didn't really know what else to say, and I felt really embarrassed. 

I don't know what to do. He gets grounded for the night. And he does it again. I've told him to just stay away from them. But he isn't in daycare, and I guess he's desperate for friends. I've tried telling him that each time he tries to be friends with them, they don't want to, and they end up being mean. I really don't know what to do now. Like.. I can't have my four year old play in our backyard anymore? Every single time he goes out there, those boys pick on him. He just wants to be friends. He tries to share his toys through the fence (something I've been trying to get him to not do). He just wants to play and make friends. And I don't know. He has long hair, so he's being made fun of? Is this what Kindergarten is going to be like? He is going to get grounded and have time-outs every time he does something not okay or not safe. Name calling, hitting, spitting... it's a time out until it happens more than once. Then it's inside for the night. I just feel like I don't know what else to do. I'm at a loss. I've never had this happen before. Any input or others stories would make a Mama feel better. Thank you for reading!"

He's gotten into a phase where he almost never seems to listen or respond to what we're saying, and instead just recites and reenacts books that he likes.

booknerd381,2021-04-27 01:18:37+00:00,Only The Pink Yogurt...but they stopped selling it,"My son loves yogurt.  He's been getting fairly picky about foods lately, and one of the odd things he's recently started doing is that he'll only eat the pink yogurt.  Yogurt is like, one of six foods I can get him to eat, so learning that suddenly only the pink yogurt will do has been a bit of a head ache.

This weekend after I learned about the pink yogurt debacle I decided I better go to the store and stock up because now we're only using half the pack of yogurt, and I'm greeted with an isle free of pink yogurt.

Specifically, it's the Yoplait kids yogurt.  There used to be eight packs that came with two flavors in each pack.  This weekend, though, every single package was one of the ""mixed flavor"" varieties that come with two colors in a single cup.  That was what caused the problem last week (there's no explaining that strawberry banana has pink yogurt in it when there's yellow yogurt in the same cup, and mixing it just makes orange).

I usually keep an extra pack on hand because, as I mentioned, it's one of the few things he eats so I don't like to run out if I can't get to the store for a few days, so it's been a few weeks since the last time I bought some, and a few weeks more since the last time I bought the non-mixed flavor cups.

I really hope the pink yogurt comes back.

In the meantime, does anyone have any recommendations for other brands of pink yogurt I might try?  I'm down to three cups of pink left, so we'll be out by this weekend."

I looked up an article about it, but they say that you’re supposed to keep them rear facing until they outgrow the convertible car seat (65lbs for mine). 

When did y’all start facing your kids forward? Do you think it’s too early for me to turn him around? Per his last doctor’s visit, he’s about 30 inches, if that helps."
bjnowtmj2mrw,2021-04-27 00:44:24+00:00,My 12yo son wants to stay at dads,"I divorced my ex when my son was just a toddler.  it was amicable and we aimed to make everything fair. Time between our homes were split down the middle of the week(3 days plus everyother sunday). Ive always lived on my own and then eventually with my now husband and two little ones.  While my son's dad remained at his childhood home with his parents. My son's grandfather is a sick man and needs to do dialysis in a hospital setting 3 times a week. 

Last year was challenging for everyone. I was making sure our household was safe knowing if we were to transmit anything through my son, grandpa would have a very hard time. We were still alternating visits until December. When my son came for his turn at my home when I got the call from his dad saying the grandpa tested positive for covid.  I was scared. I had a newborn and a toddler. My son left with his father after spending the day with us. My husband tested negative. My son and ex tested negative and quarantined for two weeks. Then their second test, just after new years, was positive. To say the least my son was at his dads until March. I consulted with my doctor and he gave the greenlight for my son to come back home saying he has immunity for a few months. My husband prefers an extended rotation, one month between households.  My ex(not willing to change at all) and I temporarily changed the schedule to a weekly visit (I was hoping to compromise at 2 weeks). 

Now the numbers are going up in my city and surrounding areas and my husband is saying one month rotation or none at all. 

I've spoken to my son about staying here for a month and he doesn't want to change the schedule. At first he said even two weeks would have been too long. He says he doesn't mind and would rather stay at his dad's. He says he likes it better there. More electronics and later bedtimes. Even though I have the two little ones, I always included him as much as I can. Doing activities here and there like baking, video games, board and card games. 

Ive been trying to explain that our house would be safer for him but he still wants to stay with dad. I told him that if he chooses to go to his dad's come the end of this turn he might have to stay much longer than intended. He wants to stay until end of August. I feel like I'm losing him. I want him to be safe and I know that because we are doing everything we can to remain so. I don't know why I'm posting this.  To vent I guess."
RoxyMcfly,2021-04-27 00:05:40+00:00,I feel so bad for my 4.5 year old,"My poor daughter has been home for a year. Summer wasn't too bad because even thought I was working from home, she was able to play and swim at my parents while I worked.

Her daycare was where I worked so it was closed.

Come September I tried enrolling her prek near home. Due to anxiety about naps, because she stopped them once she was home and they made her lay down she was crying the whole nap time ans refusing to go. So I took her out when the school said she had to and wouldn't let her color quietly.

So she has been home with me ever since. She is bored. She is demanding. She wants my attention all day every day. However my work is demanding. I have meetings and calls. I tried so many things like getting her learning books to help her right and learn number and letter recognition. I got her a laptop to do hooked on phonics. I have purchased toys and other activities. Everything I could do I have tried but she just doesn't want me to work.

She also has sensory processing disorder, which makes disciplining difficult. She is in OT, and also has a cognitive therapist she sees. Like I am doing everything I can to get and keep her on track.

The reason I feel so bad tonight is that although she literally doesn't listen to anything we say, ignores us when we are talking to her, just defies us at every turn, I feel bad cause I think she feels like she can't do anything right. I don't want her to feel that way. We always praise her when she does listen and does what she is supposed to like not throwing her food on the floor or behind the couch just cause she is done. When she helps us clean up all the messes she makes. But those things are rare and no matter the approach, no matter how gentle or stern we are as soon as I go to speak to her about throwing food she puts her hands over her ears and says I'm scaring her. I'm not yelling, I'm not being mean. 

How do you try to discipline without having to tell them every time they are doing something they are not supposed to do, when all they are doing is blatantly doing it?

How do I be better?"

Delllthrow,2021-04-26 23:40:24+00:00,Teenager (17M) is making money but completely unmotivated in school as a result.,"During the lockdown, my teenage son became very adept and passionate about investing and sports betting, while also making a very substantial amount of money--over 100k since the pandemic started. However, he has since shown no motivation in school. He started off the school year getting A's and B's but has since deteriorated into not even bothering to hand in assignments that will take any considerable amount of time and does not seem to care about his grades at all. Just last week he received a 42 on a calculus test because he couldn't be bothered to pay attention at all during class or even attempt to learn any of the material. Keep in mind, he has had a 3.9-4.0 gpa throughout high school and scored a 35 on his first and only attempt on the ACT. He claims he has no interest in going to college, but I believe he is being severely shortsighted. My husband and I have the ability to pay for all of his college tuition, and he has the ability to go to a very selective college. How does he know he won't find something he truly loves doing and is passionate about in college? For what it's worth, he does understand he is very lucky he wouldn't have to take out loans, worry about finances in college, etc., but has often told me to ""save my money"" and just let him forgo a college education. I also believe he will become lazy and aimless without a real job when he becomes an adult if he doesn't go to college. My husband thinks he is basically an adult who can support himself and should be allowed to make his own decisions, but it pains me to allow him just to basically drop out of school when he so obviously has a lot of potential. I have thought about essentially forcing him to put forth more effort in school and go to college, but I have very little leverage and do not doubt he would move out immediately when he turns 18 if I did, as he has shown willingness to spend time (days/weeks) away from home before as a result of my frustration and anger directed at him due to his lack of effort and commitment in school. What can I do?"
EstelSnape,2021-04-26 23:40:23+00:00,How do I deal with a grumpy grandpa?,"For some context my dad (71m) fell on the ice Jan 2017. He suffered from a brain bleed and since then his temper has been on a hair trigger and he has trouble filtering his thoughts at times.

My (36f) husband (34m) went on an overnight business trip yesterday and my parents wanted to help me by taking my girls (4&amp;2) for the night while I kept the baby at home. 

As far as I knew the girls were good last night and this morning. It wasn't until I met up with them for dinner that they said my 2yr old had been difficult (saying no, being a 2yr old). At dinner she was tired and acting up. I was going to bring all 3 home but mom wanted to take the girls home with them to bathe them and bring them back to me. 

I wasn't keen on that because I saw dad was getting cranky but he got crankier when I said I was going to take them with me. 

2yr old was not pleased and was being resistant toward my dad. He got upset and said ""You are just not a good kid!""

It hurt to hear him say that. Yes she was being difficult but nothing out of the normal for a 2yr old. 

I don't know what to think. It hurts that dad says things like that out of the blue. How do I proceed with my dad?"
Complex_River,2021-04-26 23:11:04+00:00,Is it really that bad to raise a kid vegetarian?,"I was raised vegetarian and have never had meat and so I'm raising my kid vegetarian as well. I see this no different than raising a kid with any other personal values I want to share. 

However, I get regularly and severely criticized for doing so and I dont understand why. People, even complete strangers, have even gone so far as to try and convince or trick her into doing it. 

I make sure she has a healthy balanced diet and that she would never judge anyone else for their dietary choices or personal values, but these things are never the things being criticized. 

She's only 5, but she knows that if she ever wanted to I wouldn't judge her and it's always up for discussion if she wants. 

I have heard everything from ""she will be a social outcast"" or ""she will resent you"" to people basically implying (or a few times outright saying) that its abusive for me to force her to miss out. 

Is there something I'm missing here? It seems super weird that SO many people are SO critical of something that doesn't affect them at all. I've kind of started to feel insecure about it because I hear it from other parents, family, and strangers alike. 

Does anyone have any insight? Am I actually doing something wrong just because it was done to me? Why is this so open for criticizing when other value-based personal matters are not?"

thebadmommm,2021-04-26 22:59:39+00:00,"I [26F] think I’m going to give my Ex full custody of our kids [3F, 4F].","I gave birth to my daughters 13 months apart. I was 22 and 23 when I had them. Their dad and I have had a decent life together over the years, but our relationship should not have lasted more than six months. For some reason, it dragged on for six long years. 

We split up in October for various reasons. No matter what he says, he is emotionally and sometimes physically abusive towards me. I was the one that made the difficult decision to move out. He STILL wants me back, even after we settled our case in court. 

Right now, we have a 50/50 custody arrangement of the kids. He pays a couple hundred a month in child support, mainly because he makes almost three times more than I do. He also has a paid-off 3 bedroom house for the kids and 3 paid-off cars. 

Meanwhile, I’m living with my parents. I recently got a new car in my own name, but I feel like it’s not enough. I can’t help but think that the kids would be so, *so* much better off if I just fucked off forever.

**They can live at their house with their dad, and I’ll just pay whatever I can in child support and see them every other weekend.** That’s my loose plan. I can better myself, fix my mental health, get a better job, get my own place and maybe get more custody of the kids after a few years time. 

I’ve had PPD for years, but now I think it’s just full blown depression. I have a sneaking suspicion that I have a touch of bipolar/mood disorders mixed with suicidal ideations. I’ve also been extremely hypersexual. Something bad is going to happen to me. 

I had kids young with someone that essentially begged me to get pregnant. I’m very nice and a pushover at times, so I thought everything would be okay. It was okay for awhile, but our second daughter broke me in every way possible. I no longer feel like an actual person. I feel invisible. I feel like I’m just floating through life without actually living it. I’m like a spirit that’s already passed on, but I’m still living in a body. 

I sleep constantly. I can barely take care of myself. I’m a functional alcoholic. I want my freedom back. I have a small amount in savings, but it’s not enough to get anywhere. I’m completely uninterested in my kid’s lives. Those are a few of my negative feelings. 

At this point, I don’t see a way out other than giving him full-ish custody of our daughters. I need to make more money. I don’t want us to live with my parents forever, even though they don’t really mind. My mental health is in absolute shambles, and I’m not a good mom in any way right now.

She is almost 4 weeks old now, but has several medical issues that require extra care.  In particular she has a feeding pump and special medications that need to be given to her at certain times of the day.  For her feeding, she needs fed every 3 hours.  We have alarms set on our phones to remind us, especially during the night.  During the day it's not too terrible, but it's much harder to do at night.  We have a basinet on one side of our bed so one of us can keep an eye on her.

Basically once our alarm goes off, one of us needs to get out of bed to get her formula warmed up, mess with her tube to make sure it's good, then start the pump.  She feeds for an hour, after which another alarm goes off to tell us to turn it off and to flush her tube.  At night this means we are both being woken up at 12, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 in the morning.  I was off work for a week while she was home, so I got into a good routine to manage all that.  I would often take naps during the day, because she tends to be up all night.  However, now I am back working and it's been really rough.

I work anywhere from 50-60 hours a week, and 10-14 hour days.  She doesn't work, so her job is the stay at home mom.  Sometimes I will have to close and then open the next day.  This means I would only get around 6 hours of sleep if I am lucky.  With the baby in the picture, I am not getting any sleep.  I have been slow getting back into the swing of things at my job.  I actually dozed off in the office the other day while working on paperwork.  This has never happened before.

I haven't asked me wife this.  I'm afraid I am being selfish, and I need some opinions from you all.  On days that I work, would it be asking too much to sleep on the couch so I am not woken up by alarms and a crying baby?  I would be happy on days I don't work to be the one to work the pump and stuff during the night.  I feel like my wife has the luxury of being able to take naps during the day to catch up on sleep, which I can't do.

So please tell me what you think.  Is this reasonable to ask?"

WersomeFacts,2021-04-26 22:26:06+00:00,Toddler Tantrum and Bath Time,"Hey

So any advice to help. I’m at the end of my rope and I don’t know what to do anymore.

Big long backstory. So we don’t have a bath tub in our house so we used a newborn tub then sink then a inflatable pool in the shower. My LO always loved bath time and it was special time if not a little back breaking but it was easy. She never liked the shower and was always wary of it. The few times we tried it she was sad and scared the whole time.

Anyway about a month ago I asked my Mum when she was around to stand by the sink and fill the shampoo rinser with sink water so that I’m not tipping soapy water on her hair so rinsing her hair is quicker. Now my daughter loves tipping buckets of water on her head and rinsing has always been a grizzle but non issue but when she started to grizzle my Mum swooped in and rescued her, winding her up and now she won’t get in the bath since.


I’ve tried getting her cousins in with her, bath crayons so she can draw on the walls while playing in water, small watering cans, goggles since she spent an arvo wearing mine, animal bath mit, cow sponge, her foam shower shield hat thing, giving her the buckets from outside she likes tipping on herself. Not even had soap or anything during any of this just trying to make the bath area a happy place. Got out her newborn tub, called it a boat, let her play with it for a few days before filling it with water and making bath slime in it. Put a giant inflatable pool up and got in with her. 

Nothing works. Even if I eventually convince her to get in the minute I try and help wash her or even get her to do it herself she flips out and wants Nan. She’s 2 next week so not that reasonable I can’t just tell her to sit in the bath. She cries and trembles and just sobs and breaks my heart. I can’t even bird bath her with cloths because, even tho I was getting her to wash me too, the minute my mum said the word wash she broke down again. I can’t even get close to getting her hair wet to wash it. I’ve taken her to my grandparents where they have a bathtub and still nothing. 

I’ve even taken to leaving the doors open when I’m in the shower so she can come in at her own pace and look but she freaks out if she comes too close. 

I don’t know what else to do. I can’t not bath her and it’s coming up to a month of trying everything above and she hasn’t had a proper wash. I can’t force her either cos even tho she’s almost 2 she’ll only listen to directions to a certain degree and I can’t hold her down in water especially since she’d fight and wriggle and sob. 

I don’t know what else to do. Is this normal? Will she phase out of it? I got a new rinser shield off Amazon which doesn’t strap around her head you just kind of hold it like a visor but she won’t get in the water. Filled her newborn tub today and we washed her baby doll but she wouldn’t get in and constantly wanted to dry off.

I don’t think it’s a sensory thing. She still loves her outside pool and dumps buckets on herself out there. (And I don’t want to try wash her in the pool because I don’t want her happy place to become another thing she’s scared of). She loves being wet. It’s the washing concept. She’s fine with the cloths at meal times for her hands and face so she hasn’t suddenly gone off the feel of them. She loves using soap in the bathroom to wash her hands.

My theory is she figured out from my Mum scooping her out that if she works herself up enough she doesn’t have to do it and she’s right but I need a solution. We can’t keep going like this and doing nothing.

And it’s not just a few tears I’m sad, it’s end of the world sobbing screaming begging for Mumma scrambling to get out scared broken down tantrum. 

Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated!!!

TLDR: toddler won’t bath. Don’t know what else to do."

Anyone else deal with this? How to give this other mom a reality check?"
queenlolipopchainsaw,2021-04-26 21:12:05+00:00,Advice needed for traveling lost distance with 6 month old!,"Hello fellow parents!

I am considering taking a trip, 10 hours one way, to see extended family.  My parents will be driving and have invited me and my babygirl along.  I have no idea how to travel with little ones. 

She is exclusively breastfed, but does well with sippy cups and solid foods. 
My husband and I have yet to travel with her, thanks COVID, so this will be her first trip longer than an hour.

I have done some research but I would like to hear anecdotes from other parents!  Anything is much appreciated!

I have a list and the cons heavily outweigh the pros.  But my great grandma just turned 99 and I'm not sure how many more times I will get to see her."
mammothswoon,2021-04-26 20:54:36+00:00,So today my almost 3YO son asked me why I don’t have a mummy,"I cut off my abusive mum about 9 years ago and thankfully don’t think about her that often anymore. However today my son just turned around to me and said “where’s your mummy, daddy?”

I tried to keep it as vague as possible and told him not everyone has mummies or daddies and that’s okay. Obviously he’s almost 3 so he asked why about 67 times but I just reassured him I’d always be around.

Thankfully I’m raising one of the sweetest little people and he just gave me a kiss on the head and went back to playing with his toys 

It’s a conversation I’ve always dreaded, I know it will come back up when he’s more aware of everything in a few years and eventually I’ll have to explain things a little more, but I didn’t expect it today. 

How has that conversation gone for any of you guys?"
theoriginalbill,2021-04-26 20:27:40+00:00,Strategies to motivate kids to take initiative and solve more of their own problems?,"I have 3 kids ages 7 to 12. I'm struggling to get my children to take initiative on their personal goals and self-direct. When they have goals, they frame them in such ways that basically mean they want, need, or expect me to achieve an outcome for them. They express a sense of feeling abandoned and not cared for when I don't respond to their baby bird calls for assistance on things that are age-appropriate for them to now be doing on their own.

When I see them figure out how to navigate entertainment apps and games that require complex steps and problem-solving in exploratory ways - I think that they are in fact competent to apply their problem-solving skills and get the same work-reward feelings.

These kids are also all making A's in school, they are on track in all areas, they can listen to instructions and follow them. They are the first in their classes to complete their work, they all get resounding positive feedback in parent-teacher conferences. They get feedback on how they actually help the teachers complete tasks, all show self-initiative to accomplish tasks on their own and even help others in the class. All without being called upon to do so. 

However, they are not willing to be competent to manage basic self-care and life skills at home. 

What are some successful strategies parents have used to successfully motivate their kids to apply themselves to their goals in the real world? 

Examples - General Life Skill Problem Solving

1. Repeatedly asking where things are when they have been told and shown multiple times. Basic items. Tape, scissors, writing instruments, masks. It's literally all in one area. It sometimes feels like they are condescending to me as follows: ""I need such and such"" ... well ok, go get it, why tell me what you need? ""well where is it"" uhh.. where it always is when we have this conversation. This feels like a baby bird who just refuses to chew up its own worm. 
2. Completing craft or other project goals that they claim look interesting but then want to quit when there's some technical aspect that requires a few prep steps or extra effort/practice. Need to rewind a youtube video to get a certain technique down? Forget it. Need to clean off a table from an old project to start a new one? Nevermind, I'll do it later (never does it). But then child drags around the house complaining that they're bored--annnnd that they want to do the craft idea. What? No. Go back and finish the thing that was challenging you to be engaged... 
3. Building outdoors - want to build a lean-to fort against the tree after seeing some pics online? Cool. We go into the woods and collect a lot of building materials - get home - child stares at it and keeps asking 'what do I do now what do I do now?' Told to just start and see where it goes, feel it out. No... instead puts a few things together with spaghetti-like muscle movement, then abandons it altogether - would not even tie some sticks together after given some pointers and beginner steps (translating geometry class and building a 3D structure starting with the faces), I try getting paper to encourage them to draw out some ideas first. I encourage them to fail so they can hone. Nothing works. Shrugging limp shoulders unless I do it myself FOR them.
4. Figuring out what they want to eat and putting that food together - stop telling me you're hungry and that you don't know what you want to eat and rejecting every option I can think of and saying ""IDK"" after any questions and not even really getting up to look around at what's available, but then once settled on an item - become apathetic and obstinant to putting that food together/learn how to put a new food interest together so it can be done independently in the future...
5. Cleaning up space so that it can be available for new activities proactively - really bad attitudes on how to manage their own stuff. Wanna take all of your stuff out for playing and projects? Great go for it - get lost in your creative fantasies. Time to throw everything back where you got it? Not a chance - having a conniption that it's 'too hard.' How is it too hard to put something in your hand to go from point A to B but then not point B to A? The kids have bins and well-organized space. I've made it as simple as possible. It's a matter of general sorting. Craft bin. Toy bin. Book bin. Play blankets/stuffies bin. Done. Instead what I find is an array of legos, magnet blocks, colored pencils, stuffed animals, empty water bottles even sometimes - all scrapped into an empty laundry bin or stuffed in a wooden baby play cradle, or piled on a dresser. What? Why? Why would you place these items in these places instead but it's too hard to put them back where you got them from? Just why? That seems like obstinant defiance.

When this sour, vagrant attitude is multiplied by 1 to all 3 kids at any given phase of most days, it emotionally and psychologically buries me. 

I've tried passively helping, explaining, reasoning, talking about the benefits of evolving into independence and self-direction. I've ad nuaseam ensured my children that they are not in fact living in a dystopian world with a tyrant ruler forcing them into slave labor. I have even had the pediatrician discuss with them that these are all appropriate milestone skills that they should be proud to tackle and dominate. 

They don't behave this way with other adults. It is just with me. They are like puppies aging off the teat and they just won't shake off. They want me to do EVERYTHING for them and to coddle them. And they are falling behind on their milestones seemingly willing to die on the hill of this warped view that if I'm not doing EVERYTHING for them at home--their own hobbies and self-directed developments of their own passions--that they are neglected and unloved and nothing is worth learning for self-direction, self-satisfaction, and self-accomplishment. Whut.

Looking for word-specific things to tell them, and action-specific strategies to apply?"

So everything went will the driver picked them up today. I emailed the teachers to let them know that they will taking the bus. When they got home, I was expecting a phone call or at least to hear the driver honk the horn so that I can get the kids off of the van... nope! I get a know on the door an hour and half after school let's out, and when I open it, it's my kids at the door BY THEMSELVES. I live in an apartment building and the front door is locked and you have to be let in. 

I ask my kids where is the driver and they say that he left once a stranger let them in the building 🤯 I didn't get any notification AT ALL that they were outside and had no time frame of when they will be home. My son the proceeded to tell me that when they got to school he just dropped them off in front of the school building. My 5yo is in Kindergarten and needs to be walked into the back of the building to get to his class room and my oldest goes in through a different door entrance they were left to walk themselves to class. No teachers helped assist or walk them either. I'm furious!"

GirlLunarExplorer,2021-04-26 19:44:01+00:00,How do i find the best preschool for my 3.5 YO autistic son?,"I need some advice on verbiage when making initial contact with potential preschools.

We are increasingly thinking of pulling our son from his current pre-school/daycare, where he's been going since 4 months old.  The teachers are generally fine, although lately seem a little overwhelmed, but the director has made me cry on more than one occasion.  She's just... so ... bitchy? We worked with her a few months ago to get a therapist/aide (provided by us, paid by our own insurance) into daycare with our son so that we could work on social skills, as he's usually off on his own not making friends and not attending to some of the learning tasks (art class, games, etc).  That therapist left and we had to wait 2 months for a therapist to become available, and she was only available in the afternoons.  The director did not like this and has asked me repeatedly to make the therapist come in the morning, as if I have control over her schedule.  Anyway, apparently she's been very difficult to work with, talking with the other teachers in Spanish about the therapist even when the therapist is there, interfering with how therapy is running, acting differently when the therapist's supervisor is observing the session, etc. We just got word this morning our therapist essentially quit, leaving us down to 1 other aide who is in daycare with him 1x a week, (the other 2 days at home).  I'm so mad and upset, partly because the therapist shouldn't have to suffer this type of working situation, but partly because my son loved working with her and now we'll have to find someone new all over again.

We are planning a return to office sometime over summer/fall, so I need for him to be back in daycare full time, so doing all therapy sessions at home isn't really an option.  This also doesn't allow the therapist to work on specific social goals like cooperative/parallel play with kids his own age.  The thought of moving to a different school is really stressing me out but I just can't imagine this back-and-forth with the current director is good for anyone.  What happens if she behaves similarly to the next aide, and that one leaves too?

I've made a list of potential preschools in our area, some centers/some home preschools, but i'm afraid of contacting them about having an autistic child who needs an aide to be with him because I can imagine how many 'no's' I'll get, especially considering the pandemic.  (All his BTs have been vaccinated BTW). 

I need a way of writing to a potential preschool about my son's needs, in a way that makes it seem like he's not a burden (cause he isn't, he's verbal, not aggressive and a total cutie-pie).  I also need a way of requesting aide placement that doesn't shut the whole convo down.  Should I even mention it in the initial email? Like wait for a (virtual) visit with preschool and mention that he's autistic/we will be provide a therapist for you?

How do we present ourselves in the best light that make it more likely for my son to get the care/schooling he needs?"
ave_63,2021-04-26 19:36:46+00:00,The pandemic has given me an urge to move to the woods. Am I the only one?,"So last week I suddenly got an urge to quit my teaching job, sell my house in the city, buy a cheaper house somewhere rural, and start working as a programmer from home, so that I could be alone all  and do what I want with my time.

I quickly came to my senses when I realized my wife wouldn't like this, and my 6yo kid would still have to go to school. Also, I would still be living with them, so I wouldn't really be as independent as I was daydreaming about. So this is not something I'm going to do.

I still find myself fantasizing about this isolated life, and I think the reasons it sounds so good to me are:

* I'm tired of my kid being home from school all the time and constantly getting interrupted by him.
* I'm tired of talking to people on zoom, and not talking to anyone at all sounds pretty nice.

So, of course, moving with my wife and kid somewhere remote would only make these problems worse. Maybe my fantasy daydream also includes living alone without my family, but I know I would miss them and they would miss me, and nobody would be happier that way. I'm hoping that post-pandemic, I'll remember why I like living with my family, in the city, near my friends.

I'm wondering if anyone else is feeling the same way, these days."
predictablePosts,2021-04-26 19:36:02+00:00,My son is nearly 2 months in the NICU and has only seen my face a handful of the times,"Seeing parents faces has to be important for something developmental for children this young right? I'm afraid that if my son doesn't see my face or doesn't connect my voice with my face that he might not understand things correctly in the future. Like how does he know what a smile is if he only sees one any time I have the audacity to take off my mask.

I was just sitting with him in the nicu pod singing and talking with him without a mask so he can see my face and hear my voice and connect that it was my face making the noises. The nurse came up to me and said ""Please put your mask on."" and before I had a chance to put it on or even respond she followed up with ""Sorry about covid"" which kinda struck me as heartless.

It's going to be another couple of weeks at least until he can come out. I know it's less than safe to take off my mask in public but I am vaccinated and I do everything I can to stay safe otherwise. Can I really not have this moment with my child? Is it going to hurt him developmentally?"
hyperbolicHydrangeas,2021-04-26 19:35:28+00:00,Caught 13 yr old son sexting and looking for guidance,"Hello:

I need some assistance working through this situation. My wife confiscated my son's tablet yesterday and starting reading chats between him and his girlfriend. She immediately found very graphic texts between the two kids and later found explicit photos. Even before finding the photos we took away the electronic access and called the girlfriend's mom to let her know why our son was grounded and to let her know that there is a problem. I didn't go into detail when alerting the girlfriend's mom but was honest that there was an issue. 

My son and I have a good relationship; he actually let me sit with him and cry out his feelings last night. He comes to me with questions and we discuss things pretty openly. The same cannot be said for his mom though and she tends to exacerbate problems very quickly. I don't know how to help him a) navigate his relationship with his mom b) understand that his actions were inappropriate and inexcusable and c) restore trust with me since we have discussed things like sexting in the past. He assured me that he wouldn't and he knew what the consequences would be if it was discovered. I want to maintain my relationship with him and keep an open dialogue and am having a very hard time figuring out how to move forward. His mom wants him to see a pastor and, I guess, be guilted into better behavior. I think consulting a family therapist would be a much wiser move, especially given his preexisting religious doubts. 

Anyone want to take a stab at this can of worms?"
Moofabulousss,2021-04-26 19:31:32+00:00,How would you approach this?,"My close friend and I have similar aged children. My daughter is about to turn 3 and her son is 2.5. We have play dates twice a week and formed a covid bubble. Having each other and these playdates has been super helpful with socializing our kids through the pandemic. 

We do have some differences in parenting. I’m a therapist and I specialize on child behavior, parenting support and appropriate discipline. Whether by chance with my daughter’s temperament or by my experience and hard work, she’s generally a pretty well behaved kid, and we have our discipline set up well. My friend doesn’t have much support from her partner and is basically an overwhelmed single mom. There are many things we do differently as parents, and I do not judge those differences, but there has been one concern that I feel warrants a more direct conversation. 

My friends son throws toys, swings toys destructively, hits and pushes. My daughter (or my friend) is usually the target. There hasn’t been consistency in my friends discipline with her son, and he is often given no consequence or many chances to correct his behavior. This highly correlates with how overwhelmed my friend is. When she is struggling with something, she essentially ignores him, and he will act out to get attention(ie hits my kid). 

I have sometimes stepped in to separate them, I have given him direct feedback, and I have talked to him in kid friendly terms about “no hitting” or “that hurts your friend, let’s take a deep breath and go say sorry”. I’ve asked before if my friend would like a hand, but sometimes to prevent my kid getting hurt I have to step in an move them apart/do the parenting for her. I’m honestly happy to help, but I don’t want to overstep my place or make her feel judged. I offer to help when I know she is struggling, I only intervene  for her/with her kid unasked when there is potential harm to either kiddo. It got better for awhile but had become worse lately as my friend is dealing with loss of family member and is more overwhelmed. 

But I think we have hit a point where I may have to be more direct and suggest that we cannot have play dates if her child continues to harm my child without consequence. In a period of two hours today he pushed her and threw two heavy items at her head. One hit her near her eye and she has a small bruise. The consequence he received was intentional ignoring and being forced to say sorry. My child is not allowed to put her hands on him, and is promptly given time out if she hits or throws (it never happens now). It has become part of the stories she tells people that her friend hits her, and I don’t want her to think it is acceptable to be hurt by a friend or to hurt someone without consequence.  My husband has expressed his concern about it as well (to me). I feel certain my friend would be upset if roles were reversed. 

I want to be able to support my friend, especially now that she is struggling, and continue our play dates, so I’m trying to think of a gentle way to let her know my concern has increased. Has anyone dealt with something similar or have a suggest for how to bring this up?"

amberalpine,2021-04-26 18:22:19+00:00,So apparently I'm completely out of touch with what my kid needs education wise.,"So my son turns three in a few weeks. We've been doing the early head start program (low income early childhood education) since September with them only figuring out how to adjust in the past three months. Every week we do a zoom meeting for parents and kids with a guest lecturer on a new parenting topic like discipline, diet, etc. This week's topic was about wellness checkups with the doctor... 

The guest speaker started listing all the reasons to the see a doctor for your kid and she mentions screening for developmental issues by checking to see if your kid can write their own name. I'm thinking, my son only learned to identify all the letters of the alphabet like three months ago, and he's able to recognize his name and others he's familiar with written out, but he certainly can't write his own name. We're still working on replicating circles, triangles, rectangular shapes and the difference between upper and lower case. I asked her about this and without a beat she was like, well you probably just aren't practicing enough you should go to the dollar tree and get some books. But I have like ten of these books and I regularly use them for arts/letters and numbers time to assist as learning materials, I just had the philosophy that even if he couldn't do them having him draw or do other parts of the activity books would make it easier to learn them later on. 

Anyway I'm here feeling like an utter failure. I read so many books, took so much time over the past year to try and make sure my kid had as many opportunities as possible, spend literally every minute of every day trying to make the days are educational and fun... But it wasn't enough and apparently my kid is behind enough for a child development professional to offhandedly diagnose him with a learning disability (she thinks dislexia?) because he is about to turn three and can't write letters or numbers."
katmio1,2021-04-26 18:13:37+00:00,PSA,"Just b/c mom and dad need time away from their kids for just one night or even a weekend doesn’t mean they are “bad parents”. We need to stop this stigma that says your life ends after having kids. While your priorities do absolutely change, by no means can you still not enjoy child-free time every now and again. In case you weren’t aware, it is actually healthy for both parents to have alone time together. 

Times have changed and it’s time to accept that."
No_Cryptographer6183,2021-04-26 17:25:47+00:00,How to raise a kid.,"Ok so for context I'm a psychology student in my 3rd year, also I'm very interested in development psychology.
I've watched a lot of videos on development psychology , read a lot of stuff on this topic on the internet and of course I've read a few books on this topic. Although I am not expert on this topic but here is what I learned so far.

Ok firstly  your kids will be affected by your life decisions, for example if you decide to get a college degree or start smoking or even exercising. These life decisions whether small or big will affect your children even if you still didn't have children.

Secondly when getting pregnant, it's a most that the pregnant mother should never be under stress EVER! ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS!  Because the first three months are very sensitive in the development of the fetus, also healthy food is very important like avocado or sweet potato.

Thirdly breastfeeding it's recommended exclusive breastfeeding (i.e. no other fluids or solids) for six months and then continued breastfeeding combined with solid foods for 2 years. NO POWDERED MILK always feed it the natural way, also avoid bottles, breastfeed it through the breast because it's very important  for the connection that needs to be built between the mother and the baby.
 
4th this is a mistake that parents  always do which is putting the infant in bed all day, you should always take you infant with you whether your going to the park or watching the tv or even when you're having guests, you don't know how important it is for the infant. They're learning stuff like face recognition or sound or color etc...

5th have another kid, never stop at one! Because having more children that aren't 2 years between, will help with the social development of the kid so much, it will also help with the competition between them.

6th develop your kid socially ESPECIALLY before the age of 5, as I said before have more than 2 kids, in my opinion 4 is the best number of having children.
Always try to surround your kid with other kids like having 2 kids, inviting others with their kids into your home like your siblings or neighbors, taking your kid to the park or playground letting them play with other kids, putting your kids in daycare etc... 

7th let your kid do stuff example if they know are at the age of knowing how to put their clothes let them do it, it might take longer than you putting their clothes for them but it's a lot better for their and self esteem &amp; independence.

8th teach your kid some skills before school for example like reading and writing, also teach them how to play the famous sport in your country, it will really help with their self esteem and will make them popular between their peers when they enter school.

9th be neglectful to some extent, DON'T BE OVERPROTECTIVE! Let your kid do stuff and experiment, let them fail in life, let rebel when they are teens, let them learn in life.  Being overprotective will make them naive, anxious, low self esteem, bullying target, dependant etc...

And there is a lot more but that what I know so far!"
Al_Eltz,2021-04-26 17:22:22+00:00,Autism Spectrum Signs?,"Our  daughter (20 mo) is the most amazing blessing we've had in our lives.  She is so incredibly easy, intelligent, and has a sense of humor that  bewilders us. But we've been worried lately.

First-time parent paranoia incoming:

She's  fine running on her feet, heels and all, but she is often tip-toeing  about. She will flap her arm as she's walking sometimes, and likes to  make a crab-like motion with her fingers without an obvious cue. She  will look you in the eyes sometimes, but she does seem to avoid eye  contact for too long. She is very talkative, but she also likes to  repeat some phrasing or words without a cue.

All these things  make us worry about her being on the spectrum, which my brother-in-law  happens to be. We know it won't affect our love for her even in the  slightest, we just worry about the challenges it poses for her life and want to help  make it easier on her as early as we can.

Additional  notes that help dispel our worries: She is more mentally advanced than  physically. She knows her ABCs and has since she was 19 mo. She could  count to ten at 18 mo, and is now counting to twenty. She has an  imagination that we can't understand how she comes up with (we are a  no-screen-time home). She is great at identifying what makes us laugh  and making her own little ""jokes."" She takes direction without flaw,  understanding exactly what is being asked. She is so well mannered I really can't complain. Heck, she can identify most of the birds at our bird feeder (""peck peck"" is the woodpecker, ""Black cheechee"" is the black-capped chickadee, ""Cow boo"" is the cow bird, etc.).

I could brag about  her all day, but I just want to point out that I feel that she is  progressing fine in most ways. We're just worried about the things I've noted above.  Anyone have any input or suggestions to dispel our concerns?"

Even so, the medication is only a slight improvement but she is still having pain and discomfort.  I am thinking about moving to an anti reflux formula to see if that helps but not sure.  I don’t really love breastfeeding so I’m really only struggling with the guilt of switching, not an attachment to it.  Our pediatrician has also given Prevacid as an option if the Pepcid doesn’t work but it makes me nervous to start getting her onto a more serious medication.  

I’m wondering what other parent’s experiences are with switching from breastfeeding to an anti reflux formula have been and/or their experience with anti reflux meds like Prevacid.  Did it help your LO’s, if so how long did it take for you to see an improvement?  Did it not make any difference?  Any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated.

So, I wanted to share with you all what we put together for ourselves in case it is able to provide a frame for the precautions you all take with your (new) family. I recognize that everyone has a different level of risk mitigation they implement in their daily lives during the pandemic, and that different places in the world have varying levels of outbreak severity, so sharing to be helpful in what worked for us because it was really difficult to put pen to paper and actually figure out what we were comfortable with and how safe we wanted to keep the little one.

**Initial protocol set, effective 1/20 in our family:**

We invite the people in this email to join a ""bubble"" to help support us and Baby after birth. We understand these are rigorous asks, however we believe this is in the best interest of baby's safety, and mitigate COVID-19 risk to the greatest extent possible.

In order to enter the ""bubble"" we require a 14-day quarantine prior to entrance, and to meeting Baby. This means:

* Get a flu vaccine.
* Self-isolation with your immediate household - no household should have direct contact with anyone outside of your immediate household.
* Grocery and general shopping is limited to delivery or contactless pick-up (Fred Meyer has a great pick-up system where staff places items directly in your trunk).
* Work remotely.
* Outdoor exercise - maintain 20ft distance from others and wear a mask at all times. This means stay on wide roads where you can move to the other side of the street if you encounter someone else. Unfortunately this means forested areas and small paths where distancing is not attainable are prohibited.
* No golf, or other outdoor activity where you cannot ensure others rigidly respect a 20 ft distance.

Once the 14-day quarantine has been completed, those included in this email will be able to interact amongst each other and with us while continuing to abide by social distancing practices - we feel comfortable welcoming you into our house without a mask, and hope you will help us care for Baby. In order to ensure continued safety for baby, even in the bubble the following ground rules will be in effect:

* No one comes over who has possible symptoms, such as a cough, runny nose, fever, etc.
* Please wear fresh clothing when visiting (recently cleaned; not worn during previous activities)
* Visitors must wash hands before and after they visit.
* No one holds the baby without washing hands first.
* Please wear a mask while holding baby.
* No one kisses baby. Period.

**New protocols, shared 4/24**

As with before, we ask that you do not come over if you are feeling ill in any way (COVID symptoms or not) and that no one kisses the baby.

That being said: whether or not you join the bubble, as long as you are vaccinated you will be able to hold baby! What we ask for non-bubble members to hold him is:

* to be outside
* to double mask (surgical mask under cloth mask)
* clean hands (we will have hand sanitizer)
* clean clothes (not worn for any previous activities)
* and to be fully vaccinated (two weeks after your last shot).

For now, this will remain an option only for family members; we are not yet ready to have others outside the family hold him.

If you are interested in creating a bubble with us we ask you to go through a 7-day quarantine. What does a quarantine look like, you may ask. If you are fully vaccinated, quarantine consists of:

* Entering public locations with a mask on for 15 mins or less (quick food pick-ups or errands are fine, no long grocery store trips)
* necessary medical appointments are okay, please take appropriate precautions
* no indoor or outdoor dining at restaurants
* if you will be dining outdoors with other vaccinated people (at a home), sit at a separate table at least 6' apart - on that note, it's fine to enter someone's home (masked) to use the bathroom or wash hands
* social activities outside with other vaccinated people are fine
* when exercising/walking/etc outdoors always have a mask with you and put it on whenever passing others
* always maintain at least 6' distance and masks with unvaccinated people or people you don't know
* if someone needs to enter your home for an extended period of time (maintenance, house cleaning, etc.) we ask that you spend that time elsewhere.

After completing a quarantine, any bubble members can interact with other bubble members indoors without a mask for as long as everyone can continue to meet the quarantine expectations."
Silvermoon46,2021-04-26 16:33:58+00:00,Please help!! 22 month sleep regression,"Hi everyone, I’m trying to hire a sleep consultant but I really need advice in the meantime. I posted several times over the past 10 days but things are getting worse and worse and I am at a loss. 

My 22 month-old refuses to sleep. Plain and simple. Up until about week ago she was sleeping 12-13 hours a day (11h at night from 7:30pm-6:30am + 1.5h nap from 12:30pm to 2pm). She was amazing at putting herself to sleep and never woke up once at night over the past 12 months or so.

Suddenly something changed. First, huge battle to fall asleep at night and naptime. Because it was unusual at first, I offered comfort and also took her to the doctor to make sure everything was ok. She’s perfectly healthy. Also no obvious signs of teething.

Fast forward a week later, we have tried CIO, fading out, mattress on the floor, co-sleeping, she just won’t stay asleep. Every day is different but last night we did CIO and she fell asleep at 8pm after 30 minutes of crying. Then she woke up at 9 and 11pm (put herself back to sleep) and again at 1am at which point she screamed so hard that I went in to lay on her floor (my husband and I decided we would address one problem at a time so CIO for bedtime and then comfort at night until bedtime was better) and she just stayed awake until 6am. I kid you not. We stayed in the dark, no talking or singing, just some cuddles to help her doze but she would wake up every 10 minutes to scream mama and cry. Like she would fall asleep and suddenly stand back up and scream.

I think it’s related to separation anxiety and I worry that CIO is making things worse. However the softer methods don’t work either and I am exhausted after a whole week of 3-hour nights. I don’t know what to do or where to start. My husband thinks we should keep her up later but my gut tells me it will make thing worse. This is worse than the newborn stage and the sleep deprivation is making us all very unhappy. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated."

He has some weekends but he NEVER uses them. He also has a drug (meth) problem that he can’t seem to resolve. He just called my daughter high out of his mind, you could hear it in his voice and him dozing off. For some reason, he can’t understand WHY I don’t want my child around him! He lives with his mom and lives 5 hours from where we live. He did live in the same state for like a year and a half but he left because, you guessed it, drugs! He can’t stay clean! It’s like the 6th relapse and I’m just sick of it!!! I’ve always been a single mom, I left him before she was even 1 because of abuse. I went through my pregnancy by myself too because he would rather hang out with his friends. I’ve done everything since day one! I just wish he would f*ck off!

Hisako315,2021-04-26 16:23:18+00:00,Daughter only wants mama.,"Contrary to what the opinion might be of a child wanting one parent or the other, this is not that kind of post. This is a happy post.

A little over a year ago we had twin daughters but unfortunately we lost one shortly after she was born. Ever since then my wife has struggled with that and blames herself for not being a better mother (she’s a amazing mother and our daughter passing away wasn’t her fault). 

My daughter has some development issues since she was born early and she can’t say much beyond “up” “da” “buh”(her version of bye) and most importantly “mama”. Any time she’s scared, hurt, tired and wants cuddles she says mama. I’m not jealous at all. I’m very happy that even though my wife thinks she’s not a good mother our daughter knows otherwise. 

Side note: before I get people getting on to me for not making her feel like she’s a good mother, I’ve honestly tried. Watching your child die in your arms really makes you question how good of a parent you really are."

CountryPractical3370,2021-04-26 15:34:15+00:00,My parents are choosing a to be God parents than attend my graduation party.,"So I am first generation in my family to go to college. I was not born in the US so my first language isn't English. You can probably imagine how hard it's been to get to where I am.


I worked my a** off with two jobs at one point to be able to graduate. Many nights of crying and fighting the erge to quit. While my parents didn't help me in anything. What I mean by anything,  is that I paid for my car, gas, insurance, food, internet, school, and even helped out with my parents phone bill. So I was literally doing everything I possibly could to help my parents, while being a college student.


I transferred to a University two years ago. It's about 3 hrs away from my parents. Finally being a step closer to graduating and then the pandemic hit. So fast forward to now being my last semester,  the school finally said we were having a gradation. So I called my mom to let her know and decided on  the exact date for my graduation party. For the actual graduation ceremony is still being determined but its around May 20-22. Of course with restrictions on how many guest can attend, 3 per graduate.


The only 3 people that will attend my actual graduation is my fiancée, little sister, and my mother. Unfortunately, my dad can't come due to work not letting him get anymore days off. They have alot of work and he can't take any days off. 


Keep in mind I don't know the date of the graduation ceremony yet.


So yesterday my mother called me saying that an aunt ( dad's sister) who she doesn't really talk to, due to family issues. Is asking if my parents can be her daughter's God parents for her first communion.  My aunt said that she doesn't have anyone to be her daughters God parents because they need to be married. Her first communion date is May 22nd, which is going to be my graduation party. 


I am so upset because she asked me to change the date. Like if it doesn't mean anything to her. I can not do it the week after due to me going on vacation to celebrate my graduation. That is why we established the date of May 22nd. So that would mean me having to celebrate that I graduated in 4 weeks. Which doesn't have the same meaning anymore. 


In the moment i said yes, I would change the date because I felt horrible for the little girl. She doesn't have anyone to be her God parents. But why didn't my mom say no? Like why did she have to come tell me and make me feel bad to be forced to change the date. She knows how important this is to me and she knows about the trip I have planned. It is so upsetting, I have to compromise and make it around  them again. My aunt didn't even tell my mom she wanted her to be the God parents, It's so last minute.


So I called my mom back and told her I was still going to have the party that day. I explained that it's not the same anymore. Especially, if I do it in 4 weeks after I already graduated. I already invited my fiancée parents, and they made the time to make it May 22nd ( ps. All of us are vaccinated). So I would have to tell everyone never mind? 


She tells me she already called my aunt to say she could be the God mother. So this means she called her right after we hung up. It was like in the span of 10 mins. She did this so fast,  like she didn't even feel bad for canceling on me. So I told her I wasn't changing the date. I told my mom that I can always go over in 4 weeks to celebrate with them. Once I am back from my trip. 


Now I feel like the bad person for not changing the date. What should I do? I feel like I am being so dramatic or even overreacting? It hurts that I won't have my parents there to celebrate with me. It also hurts that they put other people's needs before there own daughters. Keep in mind that my mother also doesn't know if she will be able to come to my actual graduation if it lands on May 22nd.

The point is that I shouldn't have to explain why it's important. They should know that it's something you just don't  miss. 


I sent a group chat to my other siblings letting them know I will still be having the party. The only thing one sibling said was that my mom was going to feel bad. NO THOUGH ON HOW I WAS FEELING. 


I honestly don't even know why I expected so much from my parents. I was expecting them to be different this time. Anyways, what are your thoughts? Am I in the wrong?"

I mean she always had been on it but since it’s her junior year of HS I’m more conscious that it’ll intervene with her studies. I can tell she’s on a group chat talking with her friends which I normally condone but they talk constantly and nonstop. Many times I yelled at her and she apologize, the constantly texting stops for a few days and it starts again and then begin the cycle. It’s like my opinion doesn’t matter at all and she’s clearly more interested in spending time joking around with her friends instead of studying or quality family time. I want to give her a more severe punishment instead of just yelling. What can I do?"
muhibimran,2021-04-26 15:05:30+00:00,Need advice for my child,"We had been living in joint family. When my son was 3, he used to say bad words repeatedly. He just heard once from someone saying and then keeps it on loop so often. The more we tried to stop him, the more he enjoys saying them again and again.

Later I got job in another country and took my family with me. We lived here for 2 years and he got absolutely fine. Possibly because it was new environment for him and less people around him to annoy. I was very glad that he got rid of all his bad habits.

I left my job recently and my wife and kid went back to the home country last week and I will also be going back next week. My wife told me he started saying all those bad words he forgot 2 years ago. Most probably he got same environment and same people again around him which refreshed his memory.

Me and my wife are so much upset again because of him. It took us a lot of time to get him on track and now he is back to same position.

I am going back next week and considering to hit him now (though I never hit him before). He is 5 now and all the hardwork we did on him seems went into drain. I am looking for serious advice because I have literally lost my patience now.

Ps: sorry for my bad English"
ihave2evilspawns,2021-04-26 15:03:39+00:00,Up coming birthday,"So my middle child's birthday I coming up in June last year we were on the height of the pandemic so we had socially distance outside event with about 15 family members all who had graciously agreed to be tested before hand. I normally throw a BIG party when the first year they start school invite the whole class we couldn't do that last so I had planned on doing it thus the whole family extend included are fully vaccinated so I am not so concerned about the number of people plus we always have her party outside big backyard plenty of space to stay socially distance and we incoirage everyone to wear a mask if they like. The only problem is may marks the first time since this stupid pandemic that people in my country really are able to go outside and do things. The week we have her party is the same week that her favorite relatives from her half sister's family (dad hasn't been apart of her life in years but father of my youngest child took her like she was always part of theirs) will not be able to attend. I worry that a lot of her friends from school will also not make it because of the fact it is the first official weekend of summer vacation for our school district. I don't know what to do. We only have two other open weekends on being the memorial holiday weekend and the other being the weekend after her birthday. I worry that no matter which weekend of the 3 I puck to have it not alone of friends and family will be able to make it. Everyone has assured me they would send gifts which is great but I don't have parties so they can get gift. Don't get me wrong the gifts are always so wonderful and appreciated. The memories that they will have are what I try to make the most important sharing their special day with the people they feel are special to them. She has had some pretty bad luck over the years with parties from rain outs to getting poison and even spending two days in the hospital for one of them. I was hoping to finally have the one she's been hoping for. What do I do?

Daughters birthday is at a bad time for having friends and family available to attend. Worried it will not be what she had hoped for after a years of unfortunately bad luck with parties? Wondering if I should change the date to another date and hope more can show up or let it go and hope for the best but chance disappointing her because 3 of her favorite family members won't be able to make it?"
brickandmortyr,2021-04-26 14:56:03+00:00,Sleep regression at 3 months,My son just turned 3 months a few days ago and he is going through what I think is the 3-4 month sleep regression. He’s slept through the night since he was a month old (I’m lucky I know) and was recently moved to his crib in his nursery. He is now waking up every 30 minutes or so and needs to be rocked back to sleep and this cycle repeats all night long. I know there is nothing i can do but ride this out but I’m so exhausted.. His dad isn’t in the picture so I have no one to “trade shifts” with. I’m hoping to get some sleep soon and more than anything I hope this doesn’t last long. Sigh
steelprimedabbleyoo,2021-04-26 14:38:04+00:00,About the friendly insults:,"From a teen to adults, we get that hearing us insulting our friends on the phone might make you think ""he is disrespecting his friends, through the phone no less, he will end up without friends at that rate"", but our insults are ironic and also considered a proof of intelligence, since getting our insult game up requires insults to be thunk through. So, next time you hear your teen saying ""you're like a raw potato, ugly, dirty and with no taste at all"", it is a competition, not a direspectful statement. Seriously, my mother hears what i call my friends and must think ""how does he still have friends? I would've ended up alone tell someone this back in '93!"". Well, it's because we laugh of each other and of ourselves which makes us stronger and less hurt by intimadators. Do as you may with that info, i am merely putting it put there. Just don't @ me for saying that.

Also, now i see the issue with my last post, brought forth by your replies was my realisation. I'm an autistic 14y/o guy in case you didn't know."
Paulinimelissa,2021-04-26 14:35:57+00:00,Feeling of failure... young adult kids not thriving. Why are they so ungrateful?,"I’ve been thinking about posting my story for years. I need to know if anyone can relate... or provide insight!

I worked hard to give my kids everything I felt they needed: as a single mom (dad saw them every second weekend unless THE kids opted NOT to visit), I attended all sporting and school events solo while holding down a full-time job/advancing my career, I single-handedly ensured their post-secondary education was fully paid for in advance so they wouldn’t have to collect debt, I took them to and paid for doctors’ and dentists’ appointments, helped them with homework, got them braces, attended parent/teacher meetings solo, travelled with them and enjoyed many MANY parks/zoos/road trips, connected them with physiological help for more difficult situations that I wasn’t able to help with, helped with their first resumes, job interviews,  and income tax reports, taught them about work ethic, how to cook, do laundry, play board games, etc. I encouraged them to live life to its fullest and do whatever made them happy — I made them my first priority... always.

My family disowned me after the divorce, so I pretty much did it all on my own; I thrived at being both a great mom and career woman. Or so I thought... neither child is living their best life and I feel I have failed them both: they both only have high-school diplomas despite once dreaming of higher education, both struggle with anxiety and depression (which I never had), one (F/22) has never dated and the other (M/20) had a two-year unhealthy relationship and hasn’t dated since. One still lives at home gaming all night, while the other moved out just prior to the pandemic (to be closer to their dad who only did the bare minimum as a parent for two decades!).

Both children have expressed recently that I wasn’t there for them emotionally and saw the above actions as “only caring about money”. I explained to them that, as a single-mom, I had to ensure I had an income to provide for them. And that the money allowed for special experiences like travelling to other countries; it also paid for their teeth, medication, and education.

Did I try too hard? Do too little? Are they failing because of the divorce from their dad? Was my second marriage a trigger to their young adulthood’s downward spiral?

Since they are now adults, should I assume it’s out of my hands? Should I assume there’s nothing more for me to do other than listen, celebrate successes, and remind them of how much I love them? Do I need to push the last one out of the home to fly on his own?

How did I raise such ungrateful kids? Did my own resilience backfire on me? Should I have shown them more of my own fears, sadness, and anger? Did the disconnect with my own family and lack of family gatherings have an impact on how they view me and how they build or avoid building their own relationships?

More Background:
F/46 here, met my first husband/my kids’ dad at 16 (he was 22 and introduced to me by mutual friends), engaged at 19, married at 20.

Had my first child (F) at 23, second (M) at 25 — I requested a divorce at 28 (kids were 2 and 4). I had never been madly in love with the dad, but marriage and kids were the “next thing to do” in my family after the long-term relationship. I was too naive/weak to exit the relationship. In hindsight, I should’ve ended it by age 18. He wasn’t the guy for me... I didn’t know who was, but I knew this guy lacked culture, ambition, assertiveness, and personality.

I raised our kids solo for 9 years while building my career. I only had one serious boyfriend during that time, whom I married and moved in with after a 6-year relationship —  I HAVE been VERY happily married ever since (THIS is what love and a relationship should be!). I did not want or have more kids, and my husband never wanted kids of his own, so it’s just us and my children.

Both children have shown anger over the years when my husband gives me a gift. Neither child has ever celebrated me on my birthday or Mother’s Day despite me helping them to celebrate others."

I'm self employed but for some reason people think that means I'm just available whenever and have an easy job and just get paid well.. lucky me.  


I have a baby (20 months) and a Kindergartener and 1st grader. I'm in NYC so you walk everywhere or go by bus. It's hell to try to park here.   


I am SLAMMED.. and have been stuck inside homeschooling my kids for over a year due to NYC schools not reopening like normal. Let me tell you.. it is BRUTALLY hard to teach small kids from scratch and you're spelling out every single word, letter by letter and the assignments never stop.. I try to cram in their academics when the baby naps but can hardly keep up. Everything piles up.  


I am cleaning nonstop.. cooking nonstop.. hearing ""mommy' nonstop.. the screaminig (NONSTOP).. crying.. whining.. tantrums..and the fact I don't get to shower for DAYS and that my self employed income is literally maybe 1/3 of what it could be.. are really getting to me. My husband works hard and is gone 6-7 days a week.. 60-70 hours a week.. I know he isn't out partying but I envy him a lot because he SEES his hard work in a paycheck and his day ends.. even as stressful as his job is he still gets a lunch and adult convo.. uninterrupted..  


The stress has been so severe and so chronic that it has caused me to have a hormonal imbalance, adult acne, insomnia.. and NOW.. as of this week.. I am breaking out all of a sudden in stress rashes on my chest and neck.. Never had this in my life until kids.. I've also gained 100 pounds (obviously that's on me as well) so I'm not feeling too hot about getting back into the job market. I know my self employed projects would take off but I Just need a good 4-5 months to double my income.   


The problem? Nannies in NYC want literally $25/hr.. I get it.. it's expensive here.. but this doesn't even include cleaning/cooking.. possibly would include them doing homework with the kids. That would actually wipe out the income I'm making now and I'd still have quite a bit to do when I got home. I'd also have to rent an office or coworking space since my baby knows when I'm home and won't stop screaming and crying outside of the bedroom while I try to work. The nearest office looks to be 40 mins away via bus.,,quickest and best option bc parking is a no go here and terribly expensive.. it also doesn't save tons of time driving..  


I feel guilty as it seems many women wish they could stay home (or do they??).. and I hate to sound ridiculous because most days I'm almost in tears.. feel like I've TOTALLY lost myself as a human being and feel very depressed when I should feel lucky... and wonder if I take the jump to work if I'll regret not seeing my kids at all.   


I have 3 kids so childcare is going to be no joke. Easily over $4,000 a month at a daycare so might as well hire a Nanny and it will be the same. Don't even get me started on how anxious I am leaving my kids with strangers.. and all the horror stories.. I think that's why I've allowed myself to be miserable for so long.  


When my husband has a day off and I get to go out, I feel GREAT.. like ME.. No depression.. it's a huge sigh of relief.   


Has anyone been in this dilemma? How did you handle it? Especially if you weren't sure you could ""afford"" to go back to work, if that makes sense.   


I keep torturing myself about all the logistics and how much money I'll be spending to basically pay someone else to be with my kids and that I'll still be stressed coming home because I'll be responsible for cleaning and cooking likely so my day won't just end. But I know now I walk around with a clenched jaw.. yelling at them.. losing my temper.. (they're VERY spirited kids and I didn't get one SUPER easy kid.. of course) and that I feel like I'm wasting my life away.. I've been doing this 7+ years.. I NEVER WANTED TO BE A STAY AT HOME MOM.. Literally ever.. It has just worked out this way because I am self employed and juggling this was helping us survive at one point.  


Any ideas? Any feedback from anyone who was in my shoes? My desperation just feels like at an absolute max but I'm very type A and stressed thinking about the details""  


1) How will I know they're safe? The baby can't even talk yet..   
2) What is the nanny is a bad person who abuses them? (I will never be able to live with myself after that)  
3) How can I afford this/nanny and to rent an office space to go work?  
4) What if I decide I don't necessarily want to be gone 5 days a week after all and miss them?  
5) Is it really worth paying $4,500 a month to get childcare/an office and commute 1.5 hours a day to go work somewhere? I'm essentially get 6.5 hours a day to work. 

6) My husband will support me in this.. huge step as he's from a Latin family and you just don't leave kids with anyone but abuelitos..but we went to marriage counseling and saw.. free childcare with his family wasn't ""free"".. they're not bad people but the stress it caused in our family just wasn't worth it.. I'm worried if this nanny/me working thing doesn't work he'll never trust to make those decisions again and go back to ""Only family can watch kids""  


  
I think I need to get the hell out of my own way.. In fact, deep down somewhere I know this. For some reason.. I have developed even WORSE Anxiety and sort of paranoia .. moreso during this pandemic than I had before.. Like I'm a worry wart but now it's like I can't stop going over in my head about the nanny hurting my kids or kidnapping them.. etc. Looking up statistics I see this is like a what.. 1 in 10,000 chance?? IDK but it's not super high.. especially if you actually vet your nanny and they have reviews but for some reason I am wound so tight and always panicked that danger is imminent...   
I also ACHE knowing I am going to possibly spend over $4,000 a month when my income NOW is that.. but I know if I work 10 hours a week now and hiring someone would allow me to work literally almost 3x more that I could definitely double my income within 4-5 months.. I guess I'm just nervous because I'm going to be in deficit at first..   


Then sometimes I'm thinking I've become such a mean mommy and this is no good for my kids..and I should even just go to work JUST to pay a nanny and even break even to save my sanity for now..   


Would appreciate any feedback.. I know it seems stupid that I'm struggling with leaving my kids with someone else and I even feel selfish for doing this after having raised them for so long."
justcatfinated,2021-04-26 13:59:59+00:00,"Large child, large diapers","So recently we had to switch our 14mo up to the next size of Pull-Ups. He’s now in 4T-5T and they fit him perfectly. He’s 99% in every aspect and has been steady with the measurements at each visit. 

He’s not a fat boy, he’s just overall freaking HUGE. Anyone else have/had a very large tot and what did you do about diapers when they got too big for what you could find? 

I want to try to potty train him soon, but he’s not showing interest yet so I’m not pressed to force him since I don’t think his bladder is anywhere near ready. But it’s coming fast. I know Walmart sells size 7 (which should be comparable to the next size up) but I don’t know if they’re similar enough in sizing to Huggies pull-ups.. which I had to put him in because tryign to wrestle this child into a standard diaper is hell, and being a pregnant balloon it makes it so much harder to do. 


I’m just... in awe of how big this kid is. Almost 3’ tall and just shy of 31lbs. To think last year he was in the NICU fighting a brain bleed to this monster sized bright little man blows my mind."
leondemedicis,2021-04-26 13:58:46+00:00,Super energetic 2years old! Looking for Ideas of activities to wear her out,"Hello


As the title says, my daughter just turned 2 and she is crazy about running. Since the pandemic I have been working from home and she was staying with me (no daycare) and have our routine which included daily jumping in the stroller and going for a jogg before heading to the park. So she associates park, stroller, and me wearing pants (pandemic edition) to running. Also we leave in a loft with a view on a trail and she sees people run on a daily base. 

In the past 3 months, she started just running in circles around the table kitchen island with all the time (until she is winded and starts sweating). When we go to the park, she will run from the condo to the park (0.6miles )
And back. At the park she will do a bit of the swing then ask to run with the ball (soccer)... 

This is great! She sleeps 12h after that but I feel like I should provide a better setting than running around the kitchen table or on a trail where I spend my time making sure she does not get hit by bycicles or other runners. 

Now that my household is fully vaccinated, I was wondering if other parents worh 2 years old had found some athletic activities for very active kids


Thanks"

Insertfake_namehere,2021-04-26 13:54:25+00:00,Are my parents right for assualting me for assualting my sister?,"Ok. The title is a tad bit misleading and clickbait-y but it still has relevance.   


On Monday April 19th 2021, I ( a scrawny, 5""6 ,120 lbs., 15 y/o male) was doing the dishes. During this time my (6 y/o, 3""6? (I don't know her weight but she is not scrawny)  sister was minding her own business.  While I was doing the dishes, I decided it would be fun to mess with her. So every so often I would stop doing the dishes and poke her with my finger or tickle her a little bit. She showed signs of not liking me doing that but I did not stop. Eventually, I found a broken rubber band and decided it would be fun to hit her with it. Keep in mind, this was no regular sized rubber band. It was one of those small ones you would put together to make a bracelet or tie hair with.  Well, after I hit her with it, she started crying and looked to my step dad. He was very upset she was crying. He came to her to ask her what I did to her. She didn't respond because she was crying. I then chimed in to tell my stepdad I hit her with a rubber band, I then proceeded to hold up the small rubber band I hit her with. Now, I'm not sure what was going through his mind at the time but, he then grabbed a broom and hit me over the head with it. Not wanting to get hit again I grabbed the broom from him. As soon as I grabbed the broom from him he attacked me. He held me up by my head and hit me against a chandelier (My mom complaining about how we broke it the next day), screamed at me about how he wanted me out his house, slam my head into the floor, and hit me in my side. After our confrontation, I locked myself in the bathroom cause I was too upset / scared to come out.  


Fast forward a few days later. Apparently, I'm acting depressed and my mother is concerned because I'm not doing my chores anymore (she knew what happened). She eventually had enough of me not doing chores and she made us all have a discussion about it.  I presented my side of the whole (the story you read) and my stepdad presented his side (He saw me bothering my sister and ""taking away her peace"" so he decided to do what he did so I would stop bothering her). I told my parents how it wasn't fair that because I hit my sister with a rubber band I got assaulted by a 40 y/o man that worked out. My parents then twisted it by saying, ""It wasn't fair to my sister that I assualted her with a rubber band."" They also then brought up me and my sister's history of play fighting. Admittedly, we often play fighted. My parents then tried to spin it AGAIN saying that I assualt my sister when we play fight and hit her as hard as I would hit another 15 y/o. This is obviously not true, I may be scrawny but I am not THAT scrawny. After that they said basically said I deserved it for hitting my sister and that it was MY fault for assualting my sister and giving my stepdad a need to feel like he needs to defend her.   


That brings me here. Reddit, were my parents right in their actions?

Some additional detail that would be important but I couldnt fit into the story:   
\-When I play fight with my sister I often use ridiculous fighting moves like: Using two fingers to hit her with or I would focus more on evading and using her weight against her to make her fall.  
\-She is often the instigator, hitting me to get a response out of me.  
\- I have multiple bruises and scares on my body from her while she has none.

\-I am very pacifistic and often do not engage in physical altercations unless needed to.

\- In the moment my stepdad was attacking me I wanted to kill him. I was to far away from our knife drawer to do any real damage

\- I broke a broom trying to defend myself from him

CavalierFishmonger,2021-04-26 13:43:46+00:00,My 4yo is licking himself and other stuff because he thinks it kills germs.,"Recently, my 4yo has begun licking himself. I will look over and he is seemingly absent mindedly running his tongue up and down his forearm or sticking his hand in his mouth and licking it all over. I’ve even caught him licking his leg and his foot. Then the other day I heard him gagging in his room. When I rushed in to see what was the matter I found out he had picked the area rug on his floor. He didn’t want to tell me at first because he was afraid I’d get mad. 

At first I thought maybe this was some sort of sensory input behavior? He isn’t diagnosed with anything but he can seem hyper active at time and I do think he might have an anxiety issue because he worries about a lot of things. We even got a referral from the pediatrician to get him evaluated but we just haven’t gone yet. 

However, he finally explained that he licks because there are germs on him. Not surprisingly given the pandemic, he has developed a serious concern with germs. He learned on Story Bots that we have immune systems with white blood cells that kill germs. So now whenever he is concerned there are germs on him - which is often - he licks himself so that the germs will get into his body where his white blood cells can kill them. He tells me this a lot now. 

Is this outside the realm of “normal” weird kid behavior? We’ve had him out of daycare since the pandemic began, so I don’t feel like I have a good baseline for normal weird kid stuff and worrying weird kid stuff. I also think I might have made it worse both by reinforcing worries about germs and by calling too much attention the the licking when it started. I am trying to just ignore it today, but it worries me. 

Thoughts? I am going to call today to make an appointment with the child therapist for that evaluation but where we live we might have to wait a bit for an appointment."
Doct0rAcula,2021-04-26 13:38:22+00:00,"Single Dad with full custody, is it wrong for my 4 year old daughter to sleep in my bed?","I won't go into too many details since its a very crazy story (you can check my post history for details) but long story short I have full custody of my daughter as a single Dad. Some nights she gets scared or lonely and sneaks into my bed. I don't exactly fight it right now because 1- I'm all alone and already exhausted. I can't exactly sacrifice hours of sleep per night fighting with her to stay in her room, and 2- I really don't mind at all, and she has severe separation anxiety from me that she is in play therapy for due to what her mother did. 

I am still close with my ex in-laws and they help me out one day per week, but they (and my daughter's mother who came back into the picture but still doesn't have custody) thinks its very inappropriate for an almost 4 year old girl to sleep in bed with her Dad. My theory on the subject is that I'm all she has right now. Obviously if her mother was still around it would be all of us. I legitimately would like other opinions to see if I am in fact in the wrong or not. Being all alone with her and fully responsible for every aspect of her life I sometimes second guess everything I do and could use some advice. 

To try to end it, I made her room exactly how she wanted it. It ended with a princess canopy that she LOVED but I was forced to take it down due to their worries that she would get tangled up in it at night and she hasn't stayed a full night in there since. I'm just lost right now, and open to criticism."

My daughter is 5 in July, shes always been a very strong willed kid, and she is absolutely beautiful when she wants to be, but it seems over the last year or so her tantrums and overall attitude have just gotten too much and I blame myself and I cry qnd I feel guilty because I feel like I'm always arguing with her or she's always in trouble and its very exhausting.
We have a 6 month old son, and since he's been here she has gotten worse, she adores her brother but to me and she's awful.
She's just started school, and now she has started saying she hates me or doesn't love me when she's mad and doesn't get her way about something, and this breaks my heart.
She ignores me, she will tell me no, then she will scream and kick and cry and throw things when I say no to something as simple as tv or a snack. 
Its a never ending battle 😭 I've tried the naughty corner, time out in her room, taking toys, taking pocket money, no TV time etc etc and it only works for about 5 minutes and she's back being naughty again or doing what she was just told off for doing... 
Any advice? What do I do, I just want to not be cranky all the time because it's exhausting. I really do love her buy man is her attitude disgusting for a 5 year old.
It is help that im always giving empty threats like ""if you do that again you'll lose tv time etc "" but then I give in because im just tired of her screaming at me and need the baby to sleep too. 
I need some advice and help on how to handle it better because I feel so guilty for always being grumpy at her, I love her and want her to be able to regulate her emotions and feel like we are here for her but I just don't know how or what to do

Illustrious-Music-61,2021-04-26 12:18:17+00:00,It it fair to give only one of my twins a car?,"Last month was my twins sons 16th birthday and while they are the same age, their behavior could not be more different. One is responsible, likes studying, helping out at home and is very organized, while the other is really rebellious and even got caught drinking recently. I can easily afford a car for both of them, however giving the history of behavior with the last one, I don't think he has the maturity to own a car for his and other safety. Because of my work I can't drive than to High School and where I live they take more than twice the time using public transportation than if they had a car.

The more studious twin asked for one as it would really give him more time for working on his projects cutting the commute time and would not object driving his brother to places he needed (while also not driving him places he shouldn't go)

So is it fair to give only of my twins a car? It seems it could escalated. 
But is it fair to deny him a car only because he brother can't have one? That seems like punishing him for somethings he has no fault on."

We haven't ever spanked our daughter before. We gentle parent and are against corporal punishment. So naturally I was already mortified to think she had been smacked, let alone to this degree. It instantly came up in a huge welt! He hit her HARD. No doubt it will bruise it has left a red mark.. I was crying along with my daughter and told my husband to leave and that we didn't want to be around him.

He smacked her because she apparently had our small dog in a choke hold hugging him and wouldn't let go. (She wouldn't of meant to hurt him she adores animals) he said he didn't mean to smack her as hard as he did and expressed remorse and guilt.

Printed out the invitations and popped them in his school bag to give to his friends. My best friend asks me later that day if we realised we’d booked his party on the same day as Mother’s Day. 

Crap. No.

That would explain why we’ve had only one person rsvp their coming (we invited 9 as that was the minimum number you could have for their party deal).

It’s no big deal in that 7 year old is still super excited about his one friend coming. I just feel somewhat like an idiot. We just don’t do much for Mother’s Day so it really hadn’t registered in my brain as having the same date as the kid’s party."

She was on a new medication for a chronic condition, but we weren't told a possible side effect was mood changes.

And it seems like he bonks his head every day. I don't know if I should be protecting him or if this is just how babies learn to get around. 

He started crawling a month ago and likes to be on the move 24/7. He's getting more coordinated every day but, usually when he's moving from sitting to standing or crawling to sitting, he often loses his balance and hits his head. Not like DIRECTLY from standing to the floor but from crouching to the floor usually. It doesn't help that we have hardwood floors :( there's a play area for him where the floor is covered in a foam mat, but since it's enclosed and not terribly big, I can't keep him in there all day. 

Sometimes I'm right there with him when he bonks but can't react fast enough, other times I'll be cleaning the floors or whatever while he explores. I feel like a piece of shit every time.

BuFFmtnMama,2021-04-26 04:28:05+00:00,Are my expectations of my 9M way too high?,"My oldest will be 10 in three months. He is such a space cadet. He is young for his grade so that may contribute to him being overwhelmed and just kind of flittering through the day. But mostly he just cannot do anything on his own or even after several reminders. He will also occasionally respond that he did something when really he did not. I cannot tell if he just lies on purpose because he does not care or if he is so spaced out or anxious he just responds affirmatively because that is the easiest. We have tried alarms on his fitbit to remind him of things then he says they did not go off (lie). I have bright green tape inside his backpack to remind him to bring his planner home. I tell him everything 3 or more times before it gets done...and these are routine things he should be used to doing (hang up your bath towel, pack your snack, grab your backpack on the way out the door 🤦🏻‍♀️)

So I am just getting really worried he is going to be some really unproductive adult. He is not artistic, creative or athletic. He really is just kind of lazy and disorganized about everything, but also is fairly smart. I really don’t care what he does as a profession, but would like him to be able to hold a job. 

I have started being really hard on him about all this to the point where I wonder if I am causing him emotional damage...by telling him if he does not get more organized and work harder he will have a hard time being a successful adult. This seems harsh to say and I wonder if this is all more about my own type A slightly neurotic personality."

A little background:

I have a 6 yo daughter who has not been told no consistently for much of her life. A variety of reasons at play here. She is the first grandchild on one side of the family, and the first grandchild stateside on the other. Two very loving sides to her. One side is full of educators (mine) who seemingly will play nearly anything with her - whatever her imagination comes up with. That’s our love language, and I think it’s an okay thing to say yes when she asks to play something. We do not let her play meanly or cheat, so “no” is said when necessary.

The other side of the family’s love language is gift giving. They are all more well-off financially and are huge gift givers. This is also the side of the family where she’s the first grandchild. She gets shown love most that way at that house. Two totally different, but completely fine, dynamics. 

Now I’ll bring myself and her father into play. We are heading to divorce due to infidelity on his part multiple times throughout the marriage. I am a full time teacher, and for the last two years, was also a full time grad student. As you might discern from my soon to be ex’s behavior, I often didn’t see him in the evenings or on weekends - “working late” or “playing ball.” Some of those were probably legit. Either way, for too many years, I took on the brunt of the child rearing while having two other full time things going on. As we all do, I often just gave in to my daughter because it was easier and I was overwhelmed. Dad wasn’t around enough to really witness any of her defiant behavior (normal kid stuff) towards me. 

Now to where we are now. I have stepped away from the marriage, and have moved to a new house with my daughter. Since making this step, I’m trying to be more mindful as a mother and the choices I make and words I say. 

In our new house, we are half of a duplex in a suburban neighborhood. Our old house was in the middle of downtown in our area and not really Conducive to just hanging out in the yard or something to play. 

A little girl lives on the other side of our duplex, but she is 3 years older than my daughter. They have some fun, and my daughter - manifesting some behaviors and anxieties of mine - is somewhat obsessed with playing with her new BFF and gets pretty sad when it can’t happen, or mad when I say it’s time to come inside. I know the other little girl really likes Lily, but also from casual talk with her, I know that the age gap will sometimes come into play and the neighbors interest in playing with her every single night. They’re just two very different developmental ages. But, they do have fun for the handful of hours over the stretch of the week. 

Today was the neighbors birthday, and last night she had an 11 year old friend of hers over for a sleepover. My daughter kept saying, “I wish we could play,” and I could tell from happenings around the house, that their entire household was prepping for the sleepover and party (which they had today). Once the friend came over, we spotted them on her trampoline. My daughter wanted to go outside on the porch to watch (this is behavior she’s learned from me...kind of torturing myself with something that I can’t have or shouldn’t have). The neighbor did ultimately spot us, and asked My daughter if she wanted to jump. I immediately stepped in saying we were about to cook dinner and have our weekly Zoom call (my family has Zoomed from across the country every week since the pandemic started). I told my daughter she could jump if she wanted to, but really only for a few minutes. The caveat was that if she wanted to do that, she had to go outside and ask if she could jump with them for a short time. She got very shy and even cried about being too nervous and ultimately decided not to. 

Knowing my daughter, and her slight obsession with this new living situation, I was pretty sure she would end up with hurt feelings (completely unintentional), especially because both of the other girls were a good deal older than her. Add to that my daughter is quite short for her age, and the 11 yo seemed quite tall for hers.  

In my head, I felt it was something she needed to learn about - not always being the “chosen one” to play and recognizing that friends have other relationships different from her own. I didn’t think it would be appropriate to work her into the neighbor’s party.  

I know her obsessions and compulsions are because of the dynamic she’s grown up with here, but I can’t stop thinking about this.  Am I crazy? Did I do her wrong? Something about the idea of her being invited just because we happened to be spotted didn’t sit well with me. I wanted to be able to talk to her about it, rather than her feeling crushed trying to navigate it so young. 

Anything y’all would suggest for the future?"
no1tamesme,2021-04-26 04:06:10+00:00,Where do you go after an autism diagnosis?,"So, I don't want to get too into the details about my son (9yo, just diagnosed last month) as I'm kind of hoping other people can use this information themselves.  When I searched previous posts I didn't really find the information I was hoping for.  Obviously, I have no problem giving out more information if someone things it can help or if they could offer more insight as the ""professionals"" we have talked to thus far have been more on the ""wait and see"" or ""well, his grades are good"" approach, which is what has led to my son not being diagnosed until 9 in the first place.

As a parent, where do you go after the ""official"" diagnosis?  My son was diagnosed thru school- sort of, they had an outside psychologist come in and do the evaluation and stuff.  But, because his behavior is relatively great at school, the services they offered were very slim (basically none) and the psychologist actually only really recommended equine therapy- which I have looked into, unfortunately, I was unable to find any within an hour of our location.  So, I'm left sort of blank with it all.  

I've been reading so much and I'm confused.  Medical assistance- check, we did get that for him.  But what now?  There's so many options and it's freaking confusing!  

Do I find a sort of all inclusive center and have him reevaluated in order to figure this out?  Do they have those?  ABA therapy, play therapy, behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, social skills.  I know some of my son's struggles thru living with him, watching him interact, etc. but I don't know what would help him the best or where to go about finding that information out.  

Thanks."
TedWong_Hynan,2021-04-26 03:46:09+00:00,My son won’t latch to mummy breast!,"Hello I recently became a Dad about a week ago and I’m still trying to steady the ship with my wife. For the first few days because my wife milk production wasn’t that high, we mix abit of formula to help satiate the baby. Then she has this painful wrist also that makes her hard to breast feed. So we been pumping consistently to get the milk production up but most of the milk went into a bottle to feed the baby. Now my wife wants to try to get baby to Latch he just goes into a rage crying when we try to get him to latch. Both sides. We were wondering maybe he is use to the quick outflow of milk from the bottle compare to the breast which takes time.  My wife is feeling stress about it and I was hoping I can have some guidance on how to get the baby to slowing ease into Mama breast and start latching comfortably."
Joey9999,2021-04-26 03:45:58+00:00,10 year old &amp; friends,"I either need some direction or I need to be reassured, I'll let you decide :)   I have a 10 year old son who, if you met him, would not seem like there would be any reason to worry.  He's smart, he's funny, he's kind, he's sweet.  When he's around family and friends that he's comfortable with, he is at his best and fully energized.  He has friends that he would consider close but (not sure if he realizes this), but they are actually just super nice/friendly kids that have lots of friends in his grade.  He loves hanging out with them, but lately the groups have gotten larger.  He'd prefer hanging in a group of 2, but because of their personality, it becomes a group of 10 and that is too large for his more reserved nature.  Plus it seems they are becoming more interested in sports and my son doesn't really care too much for that.

Now his older brother is very much like him and he has 2 very good friends and they do everything together.  This base group has made it very easy for him to feel comfortable doing things outside his comfort zone (like school dances, school events, etc).  I think my younger son needs this, but not really sure how to facilitate it or if I should just let things play out.  I live right down the street from school and work from home.  I honestly did not do this on purpose, but I always take walks after lunch and noticed one of his friends playing basketball when I walked by.  I looked around and saw my son just walking around by himself.  I don't want to read too much into it because that's not totally unlike him, but it did break my heart to see him by himself with all these kids playing.  

The clubs/extracirculars at school are pretty much non-existent this year, but we've already talked about getting him more involved next year so I'm hoping that will spur some friendships for him.  Still though, not sure what to do (if anything) in the meantime.  Is that something to bounce off a school social worker?"
Ok-Birdie,2021-04-26 03:44:01+00:00,Differing views on education,"I’m starting to look at Kindergartens for my kiddo and thinking of the kind of education I would like to her to have. I’ve taken a couple child development classes and early childhood education classes and have learned how important play is. Also that traditional school is very assessment and academic focused while missing the mark on allowing children to use their imagination and intuition for discovery to learn. 
I’m interested in these newer school options while my partner thinks the traditional way is fine. “We learned through the traditional way and have a pretty great life so all worked out.”I think also the concern is that are these play-based schools going to hold her back in any ways from her peers who are learning the traditional way. 

What do you think? Am I worrying about this too soon? 
What’s your experience with traditional or play-based education? 

Thanks for taking the time to reply 😊"
Silent-Anywhere-4706,2021-04-26 03:10:35+00:00,We all think our babies are smart but..,"I just want to brag on my kids a little... theyre twins and have a speech delay (didnt talk much at all until 18 months) i dont have any friends or family to reallly boast about them to but since the video appointments for speech therapy they can now at 26 months do 2-3 word phrases, identify all numbers, shapes, colors, and letters in and out of order, identify animals and the nosises they make, and are starting to add s’s to words. So if any other parents are questioning speech therapy for reasons like its all video due to  the pandemic or whatever, dont. Those women helped me soo much. Not that i was doing anything “wrong” or my kids were  they helped me to see that sometimes we underestimate or over estimating the kids capabilities and are able to give amazing tips on soo many things other than just speech.

JethroJames,2021-04-26 03:06:09+00:00,What is my role during tantrums? Advice seems conflicting,"There seems to be the school of thought that tantrums should be ignored, then there are some who say ignore only tantrums that are manipulative to get things but comfort the others or stay close, then there are those who say it’s fine to comfort any tantrum.

I am very confused as to what is or is not okay. 
My 3 year old has recently begun having tantrums and when this happens if it’s bad enough that she’s falling on the floor or hitting or it’s clear that it’s going to be more than just a minute long etc  I usually bring her into a room with me and I just tell her I’m there if she needs me and proceed to try to wait it out. However, she then usually climbs into my lap and repeats what she wants over and over, screaming and then I don’t know if I should a) ignore completely (this feels kind of cold since she’s looking right at me and is right in my lap   b) try to comfort her and reply to what she’s saying at risk of lavishing attention on it (“as soon as your calm we can go out”, “I know it’s hard but sorry you can’t do xyz right now”)  C) put her down and go into the bathroom or out of the room (I have been going into the en-suite bathroom to wait because the yelling is too much for me and  I think my presence increases it)

When she was 2 she had infrequent tantrums and I would typically just hold and comfort her and they would pass. Recently
if I try to hold and comfort her during these she seems to get mad but if I put her down she yells for mommy and climbs back onto me. If I leave to the bathroom it seems to escalate and extend her tantrum and she throws all of her pillows and toys off the bed and shrieks in frustration.

Any advice greatly appreciated 

Thank you"

LexaLuther1027,2021-04-26 02:56:44+00:00,Supervise your own kids better then..?,"So here is the deal: I live in a three unit complex thing. We all have kids. They’re all friends. Us adults get along, but aren’t exactly friends. We all work and have our own thing going on. Me and my direct neighbor mom (B) are more friendly and will hang outside with our kids in the communal yard area together since we both have younger kids as well as older kids. 

The last neighbor is a complicated household to explain. The adults/parents that live there are a brother (K) and sister (L). (L) has one older boy that plays with our group of kids and (K) has three girls that play with the group. (K) and the mother (S) of the girls have them back and forth a lot, but they mostly are here weekends and after school. 

Well in total there can be up to 8 kids out playing and having fun. It’s great that they have a little gang of friends right here to play with. All kids are always included and welcomed for whatever kid activity, group meals or play going on. 

Here’s the thing, the kids from the third house just kinda run wild and do what they want all hours of the day and night. They drink Mountain Dew like water, run out in the road (small rural town, but still), bring knives/scissors out, convince the younger kids to do things they know isn’t right.... it just doesn’t seem like they are ever really supervised. 

The only adult I really see supervising them is the grandma that goes over there every day. But she doesn’t come outside. I never hear her tell the kids anything.

When my kid (5) is outside playing I always check in on him or watch from the window into the yard. I will go out and say something if I notice anything going on that needs to be addressed. I will tell ALL the kids what’s up if it’s needed. I referee all the bickering and kid drama. I give out snacks and waters occasionally. During summer I am the popsicle mom. 

Well, me and (B) discuss mom stuff and yea, we talk about how those kids are never supervised. it’s not the kids fault, they’re kids. We still include them and try to keep them safe and fed. But our main priority is our own kids. We try not to trample boundaries of other parents, but we never see them around so we just treat them as our own. It’s our village. 

ANYWAYS. So now (S), the girls’ mom, just heard that me and (B) were ‘talking shit’ saying that her kids arent watched and how now she has to break her kids hearts that they can’t be friends with our kids now.... this was a huge Facebook post about how we are such mean bitches talking bad about her kids. 

Uh EXCUSE ME, I do not ever talk bad about kids. They’re kids. If anything, I am concerned for your kids safety and looking out for them. 

I tried reaching out to (S) to talk like adults. She ended up blocking me. I told her that I have tried communicating with (K) about some things regarding the kids and he has told me ‘not my problem’ or just plain doesn’t communicate back. 


If the kids are so supervised why did I find the kids with three pairs of scissors,that came from their house,  trying to scratch out the pavement? 

If they’re so supervised how was it they were at (B)s house for three hours until 930 and no one came looking for them until 9.....? 

Why do I find steak knives and big chains and tool sets and broken glass out in the yard from the oldest boy (9)? 

So yea, I’m concerned they aren’t fully supervised. 
I’m concerned about a lot of things, but I try not to judge other parents cause I’m not a perfect parent. It’s hard. I get it. 

But looking out a window once every few hours doesn’t count (that was the defense that the kids are supervised). 



I’m mostly upset that now the kids won’t be able to be friends and play because the mother of the girls is mad for the wrong reason at the wrong people. 

I don’t talk bad about kids. 
And maybe she should address it with her baby daddy that DOESNT watch her kids...? 
Rather than be mad at the two moms that spend a majority of the time keeping an eye out for the kids and doing fun stuff with them. 

End rant. I didn’t want to do a Book post but I need some outside opinions. Ugh."

Because the newborn stage is so time-consuming, I neglected to keep up with changing guidance around COVID-19. SO by the time I resurfaced 4-6 months later, I already had deeply ingrained habits of wiping down groceries and quarantining mail.

He’s a beautiful boy and I love spending time with him but I struggle to get him to nap in his cot. 

He has a bottle of milk and then I try to put him to sleep. At first I just put him in his cot and tried to get him to fall asleep himself like my ex suggested but he cried his eyes out and I couldn’t help but go back into the room to pick him up. This happened a few times that day so I took him for a short ride in my car, he fell asleep and then I took him back home and let him nap in my arms until he woke up.  I have been doing that every week since (once a week) with the exception of two weeks ago when he fell asleep in my arms straight away and I put him down and he napped nicely. But then last week he was back to not sleeping without a car ride. 

From next week, I’m going to have more days with him and I wanted any advice on how I can put him down for his nap efficiently. I heard it isn’t good for a baby to consistently sleep in a car seat. I really don’t think I can just let him cry it out, I know it works for some parents but it makes me feel upset. Does anybody have any advice I could follow? Thank you so much in advance"
peachy888,2021-04-26 02:34:37+00:00,6 month old not really using her hands,"My 6 month old isn't really using her hands. She can bat at her toys if we hang them above her but will never hold onto anything. We wanted to start baby led weaning at this age but when we put food into her hands she'll hold onto it momentarily and then drop it soon after.

I'm getting kinda concerned because lots of babies in her play group who are younger than her seem to have mastered this skill. 

She also hates tummy time. She learned to roll from back to front at around 5 months, but then gets stuck and cries to be flipped over. She can only do tummy time for maybe a minute before screaming out for help.

I just want to know if there are any other babies out there who never held onto things at 6 months. How did they progress, or was it an early symptom of something else going wrong?

Also for bad tummy-timers, did it delay crawling or walking?

Getting quite concerned and any advice would be greatly appreciated."
Lawlmuffin,2021-04-26 02:11:02+00:00,First time,"I know this may be silly, obvious, and goes without saying to a lot of you, but for a first time parent I never really thought of this and wish I had sooner.

When you're out and about with your infant/toddler, be patient with them and take things slow. Don't rush if you can help it! ***They are literally seeing and experiencing the world/new things for the first time.*** Literally every trip out of the house (or even in the house!).. to a park, walk around the neighborhood, ride in the car, etc. Every experience has new sights, smells, feels! We can't even comprehend what that's like. It must be incredible.

So next time you're in a rush, just remember your little one, and try and slow down for them. Once you realize this, it makes going on trips outside even more special."

They both moved to our city to be close to us and help with the baby as much as possible. They both also have children under 10 year olds (young grandmas lol). My mother has had a lot of health issues lately and has not been able to help as much. She also does not really have a set schedule or a car so it can be difficult to work around (i do not have a car, only my husband).

My MIL has 4 homeschooled kids who are busy in sports and is demanding to have a set schedule. Also kind of has hinted that she takes care of baby more than my mom since moving here and has made some remarks that hurt. 

I know my child is well taken care of with both of his grandmothers. But I have no way to plan around their schedules. There are days when I can only work until 1pm or I don’t get to start my workday until 11am. It is causing me stress and to fall behind. Having to work around my moms, MIL, and husbands schedule just to do my job has been so hard. I feel so defeated, but the thought of sending my child to be taken care of by strangers just sends me into ugly crying. He is already walking, super active, eats tons, and well a BABY! Also, daycare in our city is crazy expensive and we will be on a VERY tight budget.

My question is should I just keep trying to make it work with grandmas or look for a daycare? Have any of you been in a similar situation? I just don’t feel truly supported and I feel like I am asking too much out of others."

I was very upset by this. My wife asserts that it is an okay thing for her to be allowed to hold and use (lightly supervised) whereas I have very strong feelings that it is dangerous and absolutely not something she should be allowed to play with.

We have strongly opposing opinions about this. I would describe my wife as a generally good parent whose parenting style is influenced by a mix of montessori and free range parenting. I would say that I am more cautious with our child's safety than my wife, but would not even begin to describe myself as overly cautious. I think cuts, bumps, and bruises are a normal part of growing up but I feel like with something like this, the consequences of something going wrong could be catastrophic; and that my wife's parenting philosophy is sometimes poorly balanced against the safety of our toddler.

7777777idk,2021-04-25 23:12:31+00:00,Advice from a kid who used to hate her parents,"I just want to say it’s never too late to turn things around- it may take time and hard work but seriously, your relationship with your children can change. I remember as a child, my parents were pretty good, there were rough moments but nothing crazy. My older sister always had a type A personality- perfect grades, did sports, sang in a choir, was religious....and then there was me (complete opposite). Since she was older and my parents “raised her first” it was very obvious that raising me as a teenager was a challenge, like as if they’d never raised a teenager before. I struggled...a lot. I had major depression and anxiety and terrible adhd but my parents didn’t understand it- they told me to suck it up, they compared me to my sister and peers. I began drifting away, caring less, and hanging out with older kids who were sort of a bad influence. Me and my sister had a terrible relationship, i resented her mostly for the way she treated me and fat shamed me, but for being everything i could never be. My family was constantly scream fighting, like none of us got along. I used to get in terrible fights with my parents, usually for not completing schoolwork or cleaning my room, but also because they knew i was doing things i “wasn’t supposed to do”. I always felt like they wished i was more like my sister and it hurt. I was never physically abused but i felt very mentally abused and exhausted. I always knew i would be screamed at for something and they just didn’t understand that i was struggling very badly. I was going through things i didn’t feel comfortable telling them about bc i felt like I would be in trouble. When they would barge into my room yelling i would just cry, and that made them more angry. I can still hear my dad screaming “You can’t just bury your head in your hands and cry” and I would just think to myself ....yes.....yes i actually can??? over the years it got to the point where i stopped caring about anything because I knew i would never make them proud. I started skipping school and never completing a single assignment. They ended up moving me to another school bc i was being heavily mistreated by the staff but that’s another story- i beleive this is when things started to turn around. I think they started to see why I was struggling so badly, i just had it rough in highschool. Unfortunately moving schools didn’t end up making anything better and i still was heavily struggling. At this new school tho, the staff actually took notice that i needed guidance. They put me on a 504 plan and had me meet weekly with the school psychologist. Unfortunately more and more shit kept happening in my personal life and i totally gave up. It got to the point where i would refuse to get out of bed in the morning, i would just wake up and cry. I would beg my parents to let me drop out and they didn’t like that, but over time they began to realize it’s what i needed. It was at a point where i had been absent for months. They finally decided they would listen to me and pull me from school and i swear ever since then our relationship has been so solid, like i literally picture them with a halo on their head. They truly changed their ways and i will forever appreciate that. I don’t see them for who they used to be I see them for who they became for me. I think sometimes we forget our parents are growing up just as much as we are. my parents had me at 23 for christ’s sake i mean they were never ready. Now they understand that they just needed time to become the parents i needed. Now they tell me every single day how grateful they are for me and how special i am to them. Now i know in my heart that they really truly love me for who i am and don’t see me as a failure. I guess my point is that despite all the horrible things they’ve said to me in the past, all i think about it how they treat me now. If you’re in a rough place with your children just know it’s not too late to turn it around. My parents and i weren’t on the same page until I was about 17. Now i’m 19 and i could cry every time i think about how much I love them, like i’m sobbing writing this lol. Just make your kid feel loved, it’s all they need."

My ex husband is moving back to his home state which is just the next state over but it’s still more then a 3 hour drive to where he lives. We have three kids together, our 7 month old son, and our two daughters that are 8 and 5. Currently we have 50/50 where he takes them four days a week and I take them five and then we flip it so next time he gets them five and I get them four. With him moving this won’t work anymore and we can’t seem to find common ground in a new agreement. He currently wants them for June, July, and august and any holidays but I’m totally against this. He also suggested taking them just weekends but that’s such a long drive for an overnight visit.

aznuke,2021-04-25 22:42:48+00:00,Tantrum Town,"My son is 2 years old (30 months if it matters).
Whenever we go anywhere, he is a wonderful example of a well behaved child. He is a teachers favorite at his daycare. Even though I am a bit biased, I still maintain that my son is a sweet, generally gentle, loving, smart, and inquisitive 2 year old. 

But at home....oh, at home...

Here we go:
If you say no to the smallest of requests - Tantrum Town
If you have to give him a bath - Tantrum Town
If mom (and only mom) gets up to use the bathroom alone - Tantrum Town.
If you offer him ANY kind of food other than the treat he is asking for - Tantrum Town.
If you snuggle his brother for even a second - Tantrum Town
If he wakes up in the middle of the night and you put him back to bed - Tantrum Town.

Anything can set him off. Anything. And nothing consoles him. You just gotta wait 10, 20, 30 minutes for him to wind down. 

Sometimes he yells in frustration. Most of the time, he hits. A lot of times he throws things (or acts like he's going to throw things)

Mind you, this is only at home. Get him out of the house (literally anywhere) and he's a golden child. But at home, he is another child completely.

I do not know what to do. 
I am baffled.

YellowLedbettah,2021-04-25 22:23:46+00:00,13 year old is scared of kids her age,"Does anybody have any tips with helping my daughter (13) out of her shell? 

My daughter (13) happens to be very very shy around kids her age. Even around her friends shes known since she was 11 shes a very toned down version of herself, which is weird since around adults like her family members and my middle aged friends and especially; *especially* old people for some reason, she has a very powerful presence and doesn't really seem to struggle to keep a flow in a conversation

I asked about it, she confessed to feeling very self conscious and even terrified whenever kids her age are around

She said she would like to get some close friends that are in her age group to but at the same time she said she felt like ""crumpling into a ball"" whenever a kid her age tries to engage a conversation, she said she always ends up babbling something weird and awkward whenever she tries to talk to them.

 She isn't very clear with her wants, Im very confused, and shes kind of a dramatic. (said she'd rather swallow a sword than go to the clubs at school) (i also suggested getting to know her classmates via chatting online if shes scared of actual talking, but she said she doesn't have much of a grasp on socials, and said it would be weird to randomly disturb someones inbox) 

Any tips? Opinions would be lovely too.

Thank you for listening"
nadzicle,2021-04-25 22:12:13+00:00,11 y/o daughter has behaviour issues and I need advice,"FTP, so I’m sorry if there’s a formatting issue here or if the title should have been worded differently.

My daughter has had behavioural issues since she was six. I was told for a year or two that “it was normal” “it’s just a phase girls go through”. As someone who didn’t have a normal childhood (parental abuse, neglect etc), I didn’t really have anything to compare it to so for a time I believed them. After awhile, I was told by friends that this wasn’t normal behaviour (she would scream at me for hours on end at night if she wasn’t given her way, would scream at me when I was dropping her off at school because she wanted me to take her to class, would throw books, had issues staying on task and needed to be constantly told what to do because she would get distracted and forget) and I should get help for myself and for her.

Well, I did. We’ve both been in therapy for a few years now. Unfortunately I’ve had more luck than she has. I’ve tried a few times to get her assessed for adhd, to get her to see a paediatrician, to get extra help and it’s gotten nowhere. She’s on her third psychologist but this one actually seems pretty good. But her behaviour is still pretty terrible. She has a checklist now to keep her on track in that regard, but as I suspected, her emotional age is that of a toddler. Which means when she’s anxious or overwhelmed or upset, I have to regulate for her.

What I need advice with is how to handle the aftermath of her outbursts. As she’s gotten older and started hitting puberty, she’s gotten more angry and aggressive. She spirals pretty fast and refuses to calm down or try the methods we’ve been given over the years. If she realises we’re trying to calm her, she’ll do something to keep herself angry. Last night, because she was told no for a few things, she was screaming about me clearly hating her and she hates me and she doesn’t care, and I’m mean. It was suggested she spend some quiet time in her room to calm down and she refused and went into my housemates room and under one of the beds in there. I decided to try what the current psych suggested of just letting her know I was there for her and that we could try deep breaths and quiet time. She spent 12 minutes making noises because she said that she didn’t want to do what I said. Because I said it. It was two hours of screaming and vitriol towards myself and my housemate. I don’t know how I’m supposed to deal with her afterwards. Dealing with the outbursts is hard enough, but does she get consequences, do I go stricter? I’ve done positive reinforcement and reward systems to no effect, I’ve been super strict with rules and consequences to no effect. I don’t know what to do aside from what I’m doing, and it’s so damn exhausting.

Many methods have been tried, I’ve read the PPP stuff, we’ve tried exercise, meditation, yoga, the colour chart, counting, breathing exercises, talking versus not talking, consequences versus none. She isn’t an abused kid, she’s very loved, gets told so daily, she gets affection and attention. Yet she acts like she’s treated horribly. Even right now, at 8am, she’s acting as though she didn’t do anything last night and is being rude and disrespectful. And all I did was ask her if she had clothes on the floor and if that’s where they belonged, followed by telling her to pick them up.

I’m so tired from it. I love her and I’m trying my best here, I’m in the process of trying the paed route again and gathering all the info I need for the referral, but that obviously takes time. Her father is only around fortnightly on weekends and she goes to his mums place for their time. He refuses to think she has anything going on, although recently he’s decided that she must have asd and has been telling her that. I’m sorry for the ramble, I’ve never asked for help on a group before, I don’t know what to put in here."

TWICE! In two days my sweet baby has said her teacher says shut up. And twice my child has told her parents to shut up because of it. 

I’m pretty mad. That’s completely unacceptable to say in front of kids at daycare! My husband said I need to be cool and calm but I think I need to be a little spicy and let them know i won’t be paying for childcare that continues to behave this way and teach my child this.

lklanghow,2021-04-25 21:40:58+00:00,Newborn Sleeping Habits,"Hi hi. New mom here. I don’t have a ton of “mom friends” so I come to Reddit for support..

I am wondering about the sleeping patterns of my daughter. She is just past 9 weeks old. I’m just wondering if it’s normal to have some days where she is super sleepy still, and some days where she never seems to want to take a nap. 

Yesterday and the day before, she’d take short little cat naps all day and be super alert and active, while getting one solid 90-120 nap in at some point. 

Today, it seems like all she wants to do is sleep. It feels like she’s slept more than she’s been awake. (And for the last two weeks she has consistently been going to bed for the night between 8-9pm and waking up between 6-7am, with one feeding session that’s sometime been 2-3am)

She seems to have this pattern every week on a bout a 2-4 day pattern. 

It really freaks me out and concerns me when she’s has a super sleepy day. I get really nervous that she doesn’t feel like well, or it’s indicative of something greater than what we can see. She just seems really lazy and different than her other days. My husband and mom don’t see reason for concern, but I can’t help but get a little nervous. 


(Also, she eats really well and has been gaining like 8-10 oz a week since she was two weeks old. Great wet and dirty diapers. She is also strong and can hold herself up during tummy time.)"

Our daughter turned 1 last week and she’s been fantastic for this whole first year. She is non stop laughing, smiling, giggling, eats well, sleeps and naps well, plays well and seems really intelligent. However she’s never been much of a mover. She lays on her front to play and will roll around to move to toys etc, but any attempts to get her onto all fours or if we put something in front of her to crawl towards results in a meltdown. Standing wise she can stand up if we put her in the position and she’ll hold herself at the table etc, but will only really pull herself up from our knees or a pillow, she doesn’t do much climbing or pulling up at all. 

Now I’m not sure if I’m here to see if anyone else experienced similar and suddenly they started crawling/walking at 13/14 months or if people can offer advise, but coming out of lockdown now and seeing family, friends etc we face the obvious questions of “is she not crawling/walking yet?!” Etc.

Sir_Dragon17,2021-04-25 21:19:30+00:00,Having trouble getting my 2 month old to nap alone during the day,"My daughter is about 8 weeks old &amp; she sleeps **so** much better when lying on someone. Which makes total sense. We’ve been trying to get her to take a nap during the day alone in her crib (obviously with the monitor pointed at her so we can watch). But we’re struggling.

She loves to wave her arms around a bunch, so that typically wakes her up. Overnight she sleeps in a sleep sack that allows her arms to be up but zipped inside as well. 

Anyway, it’s very difficult to get things done during the day (or sneak in a nap for ourselves) if she doesn’t nap alone during the day. She will sleep if one of us is holding her.

Any ideas?"

I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

CerousRhinocerous,2021-04-25 21:08:15+00:00,Is there anything I can do here? Will our relationship always be broken?,"I have an adult son, the eldest of my children, and he is a good guy with a good heart. He is quite solitary and spends a lot of time on the computer. He does hold down a fairly demanding job and is responsible, but he is staying away from relationships, and I worry he is lonely and unfulfilled.

I had him when I was quite young (1990), and there were a number of things in my life that I messed up back then. I was not a bad mother, but I wasn’t ready to be a mother. The person he grew up thinking of as his dad was not his biological dad. The family knew - I wasn’t tricking them, but we decided early on that we just wanted him to feel like he was as much a part of the family, and so we never told him then. He was treated with kindness and accepted without question, but the marriage was rocky and immature. As my son got older, there never seemed to be a good time to tell him. I got divorced from my first husband in 1998, after several years of separation where I was basically a single mom and the sole breadwinner for the family. I did my best. In 2004 I married again, to a good guy who did his best to co-parent my two kids. Life got better, and my son went through his teenage years with me and his stepdad in a harmonious household, but with some of the typical high school turbulence. It didn’t seem like a good time to tell him then either. 

Fast forward and he became an adult, and I realized that I didn’t want to keep this a secret from him forever. I was afraid he would get on of those 23&amp;me tests and he’d know and feel betrayed and I didn’t want that. I’m the person he should hear it from. So one weekend when I knew we’d have a long time to talk with no interruptions, I gathered my info together and I got up the courage to tell him everything. I gave him all the options, I let the family know that he might be reaching out to them to talk about this. I apologized for all of it. I was prepared to do whatever he wanted or needed me to do to help settle this in his mind. I also wanted him to know and understand that ultimately, though, he was loved, and we all truly were his family. Even my exes’ family, and my new family - we all love him and care about him and want the best for him. 

That was like 7 years ago. For a while, we talked about it a lot, but then it sort of seemed like he was ready to put the topic aside. I thought he was moving past it, but recently I learned that he is still really angry with me about it, and that he feels like he’s stuck in a loop thinking about it and can’t let it go. It’s keeping him from being whole and happy and having confidence in himself. He could take some action to find his birth dad, or talk to us about it or something...but he doesn’t. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know if I should bring it up, apologize some more, or what. It hurts me to know that there is this rift between us, and I wish there was something I could do, but I feel like anything I would do at this point would only add salt to the wound. 

What would you do in this situation?"

Ilikecosysocks,2021-04-25 20:45:58+00:00,A big rambly rant,"Apologies this post is long and incoherent, I just need to have a rant. I want to start off by saying my partner is overall a really lovely person and I love him to bits, but this is going to be a very negative snapshot of our relationship.


Today was a nice day for the most part, but after being on baby duty with our 18 month old all day I was starting to get a bit frazzled as the day went on. Even when LO napped I was getting jobs done including things for my partner that he wanted done but didn't want to do it himself so he asked me to do it, all the while he is playing computer games. I finally finished the errands and I fire up my PC to have an online game with my partner, the round starts and LO wakes up. Despite having been playing for nearly 2 hours already my partner makes no effort to go to LO so it's up to me to leave and go see to him.

I entertain LO for a while, we play, read, sing, go outside and whatnot and it is soon time to get dinner ready so I let my partner know and give him the choice of cooking or looking after LO. He opts to look after LO, which is great for me as I'm ready for a bit of a break and I can stick netflix on when I'm cooking. I get things ready in the kitchen, put my netflix show on (which isn't a show that's suitable to have on when LO is around) and after about 2 minutes my partner comes in with LO and sits in the kitchen playing on the tablet. I turn netflix off and am now cooking around a very inquisitive 18 month old whose new favourite thing is emptying the kitchen cupboards while my partner plays games and half heartedly keeps an eye on LO.

Things really start getting tough during dinner, this week LO has decided he's not going in his high chair he wants to be in a regular chair however we don't have a booster seat yet (it's getting ordered tonight!), so it's a juggling act of keeping him on the chair and feeding him, whilst also eating my own dinner and my partner is still playing on the damn tablet. After I finish eating LO is just being a massive fidget so I pick him up and notice he has peed and his nappy leaked so his trousers are wet. I'm getting quite stressed now and I ask my partner does he want to change LO or clear the table, he says he'll clear the table. I change LO and go back into the kitchen to see my partners idea of clearing the table is putting our two plates near the sink, LO's dish is still out, the glasses and placemats are still out and the food that LO spread across the table is still there so I have to clear that away.

We cobath with LO and my partner offered to do it today, so he ran himself a bath and stayed in for about 20 minutes before asking me to bring LO in, at which point he told me he forgot a towel so when I bring LO's towel could I bring him one too (he always does this), I know it's not a big deal because I'll be grabbing LO's anyway, but during the 10 minutes he will have LO in the bath I have to change our bedding, check the temperature of LO's bedroom, make sure I've got the right tog grobag for that temp, find him a sleepsuit and set up the changing mat for drying LO off and getting him ready for bed.

After doing all that, I take LO out of the bath to dry him off and get him ready for bed, he isn'tcooperating, and he doesn't want his nappy on, it's just a whole ordeal. Finally he's dressed, my partner is out of the bath and I go to the bathroom mainly just to have 5 minutes to myself. My partner has done nothing with LO since, his hair is still wet, he's no closer to being ready for bed. I blow dry his hair do his teeth, get him in his grobag and start the bedtime routine.

At this point my partner asks if I'm okay, I tell him I'm just a bit overwhelmed with everything and he says ""well if there is anything I can do, let me know"". Seriously?!?! Just think when you do things!! Help out during the day, don't play on the tablet all the time, when I'm doing a job and you're looking after LO keep him out of the way, actually follow through with jobs you opt to take on instead of leaving it for me to finish them, you know LO can't go to bed with wet hair so take some initiative and grab the hair dryer instead of waiting for me to do it, be fair when it comes to down time, value my time as equal to yours!

""if there is anything I can do, just let me know"" - I can't tell you how much I hate that phrase, it feels like such a lazy cop out. You can see there are a million things to do, just pick one!


Also, the amount of time he has spent on the tablet these last few days is ridiculous, it has been almost constant. I have spoken to him about the amount of time he spends playing games while he is with LO before and he eased up for a while but it started up again. And only earlier this week we decided to make an effort to stay off our phones and keep the TV off during the day as LO isn't talking yet and we read that can be delayed by having screens on, in fact the following morning after that discussion he came downstairs when I was giving LO his breakfast and I had put the news on and my partner called me up on it and ""reminded"" me that we had agreed to keep it to a minimum. 

Sorry for rambling and generally being a Debbie Downer, if you are still reading thank you very much for putting up with me! I think I needed to get that off my chest."

The only activities they do is going to his sports games (which she hates) and occasionally going to lunch. Other than that they’re just in her bedroom in bed. She’s tried to get him to go swimming or bowling but he doesn’t want to. Then he’ll leave after spending the night and go do activities with his friends. She also buys him food frequently. Yes he buys food for her as well sometimes but the frequency at which she pays for stuff bothers me. She works part time and is in school so she doesn’t have a lot of money. 

This is going to sound unjust and ridiculous but he frequently takes the most horrifically smelly shits. Like I’m glad you’re so comfortable guy. When he’s here I just want him out. I know he’s just laying in her bed. This is their relationship: he comes over, gets laid, eats, shits, then takes off to do his own thing. It’s infuriating. 

Do I bring this up to her? If so how should I approach it? Maybe I could limit his sleepovers to just twice a week. 

TL:DR
Hate when my daughters boyfriend spends the night and wish he treated her better."
whits900,2021-04-25 19:49:45+00:00,Believing everything on the internet,"My 10 year old son has recently been repeating things he has “learned” or thinks is just cool/awesome/interesting from certain YouTube videos or other sites, many of which are (to me) obviously fake and done to get viewers or more people to their site (yes locked down and all age appropriate). However, my son thinks it’s all real. Nothing I say will convince him otherwise. His response? They’re nice people they wouldn’t lie. He’s on the autism spectrum, and once he’s convinced of something it sticks. I want and *need* him to be able to think critically, and understand that not everything on the internet can be believed. Right now I’m here to monitor it, and the subject matter isn’t of much consequence, but eventually it will be. I know he’s young and he could just naturally “grow out” of this belief, but it scares me, knowing how much craziness there is out there (and how easy it is for all the crazies to get together online) and I don’t want him getting sucked into that. I just have no idea how to help him gain this skill. I guess I’m just looking for advice or checking if anyone has experienced the same thing, and how they dealt with it."

 Even if/when she gets EXACTLY what she ""wants""...?... It is NEVER EVER EVER good enough. Not even slightly. Not even if it's better than what she had/did before that. 

She will constantly find something to complain about, something that makes EVERYTHING that's presently there, or going on in the moment, unbearably NOT good enough. Holy unsatisfiable discontentment. It's ALWAYS something, she wants it different. And she WILL make sure to have a crappy attitude the entire time until she gets what ""she wants"" 
She'll throw the most absurd and drawn out, over-the-top fits, for literal HOURS (I am not even slightly exaggerating, no joke) and regardless of if we give in, stand ground, (attempt) compromise, or do EXACTLY the thing she wanted to do (before, during or after).... It still DOES NOT STOP. 

Even When we do the thing, go to the place, leave the place, cook the food, watch the movie etc.  that SHE wants... It's never good enough. She refuses to be content, satisfied, pleased. Happy, OK WITH .. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. 

This is not just a ""phase"" 
It's full blown control issues.
But not even, because having control of ANYTHING,
ANYTIME
ANYWHERE
ANY WAY..
""Simply"" DOES NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE!

It is causing problems with my relationship, our family, and every single part of daily anything. I don't know what else to do.

I want to give up on her, her mom, our ""family"" in general..

 I can't do it anymore.

 She wasn't always like this. But I am losing any patience I have left. It's almost not worth the frustration/stress/anxiety/anger/sadness/time/etc at this point."

mamma__mia__,2021-04-25 19:24:05+00:00,7 month old choking/gasping for air :(,"Hello parents! 

I'm in need of a sense check as I'm becoming increasingly worried about my son. 

From when he was a newborn, my 7 month old has semi-regularly experinced short episodes of choking/gasping for air. These would happen sometimes when feeding, as he slept or just randomly throughout his day. This weekend though, it's happened 3 times, one of which he was really struggling to catch his breath and it frightened the life out of me. Each time was while he wasn't eating or drinking. 

Is this normal in any way, does anyone out there have the same? It was really only happening maybe once or twice every 3 weeks or so. I'd put it down to him swallowing funny and it going down the wrong way but this weekend has me worried out of my mind that it's something more serious. 

Any thoughts or advice before I call the doctor tomorrow very welcome, thank you!"
drewxangel,2021-04-25 19:00:59+00:00,My brother (9m) shits on himself &amp; I need advice badly (sister 20),"So my brother (9m) has always shit his pants sadly &amp; everyone in our immediate family knows. Everyone has talked to him, yelled at him &amp; even tried to be understanding. It's getting really old this has been happening pretty much most his life. My mother is a single mom &amp; she can only do some much she has done everything she can to try to help him but he keeps shitting on himself. 

His health 
My brother has had a health condition regarding going #2 &amp; it was a very rare condition where all his organs were literally filled with 9 years worth of shit. That has been taken care of got medication for it &amp; followed all the steps. He still continues to have problems &amp; we are all tired of it... 

Family 
My brother's father (technically we are half siblings but I claim him as my brother) is pretty much out the picture so no real father figure &amp; no discipline from a man besides our grandpa. Like I said before my mother is taking care of this situation pretty much on her own. She has tried paying him money each time he goes in the toilet, had explained to him boys his age don't do this anymore. I mean it's not normal to see your brother wash his own shitty underwear where the dishes go &amp; he says that he's used to doing that.

We are all very angry at him when it comes to this &amp; none of us know what to do anymore... I've even jokingly told my mom to get him diapers.. has anyone experienced this &amp; how long did it go on? Advice would be appreciated &amp; thank you."
NeganLucielle,2021-04-25 18:51:23+00:00,Is the family dynamics changing?,"Just curious if others are in the same situation. I was born in the 70's, currently in my upper 40's. While growing up way back when with my Boomer parents, I was always told at 18 we would be out of the house. My parents made good on their word with my two older brothers. Both left on bad terms and joined the military. I was only a year after them but left at 19 to join the Corps myself. College wasn't really an option. My dad told me before I left that I could stay at home and find work but he would have me pay rent until I found my own place. I thought my best option to learn a skill/trade was through the military. I felt I needed to do it to see what else was out there. 

Fast forward 20 years. I have 2 older sons, 20 and 18. I can't see just kicking them out to find their own way. Ones working as a cook, and the one graduated from the fire academy to be a firefighter, but only getting experience at a volunteer department. Neither of them can afford to live by themselves. I would like to encourage them to spread their wings but can't throw them out in a society that they can't financially live in.

We rent a 4 br house. We want to buy a house but this area is SOOO EXPENSIVE. What we qualify for doesn't exist. Wife wants a 4 br house so the boys will always have a place to come back to. I understand that, to a point. It doesn't exist in this area. We would potentially have to move 6 hours away (another state) to get something in our price range. We've already packed up and moved 6 hours from our original home state to work here. 

I feel like I'm trapped between a rock and a hard place. I don't think it's fair to force them out, but I think my wife's belief about maintaining a 4 br house to have a place for them to move back to is a little unrealistic as it doesn't exist in out budget in this area. I also don't feel right asking them to pay rent if we continue to stay here. No telling how long we will be able to rent this home."
chacharella,2021-04-25 18:44:23+00:00,Reciprocating bad behavior back onto the kid,"I feel a bit naive about this but here goes:

My husband is a big fan of reciprocating bad behavior back onto the kid that did it. For example, my 5yo son hit the dog, which he knows is not nice or allowed. My husband might then hit my son--not hard as far as I can tell, but definitely enough to make my son whine. Then ask him, ""Did you like that?""

I don't like this form of parenting. I try to be on the ""gentle parenting"" end of the spectrum but it's hard to convince my husband that it is a better approach when is not always effective. I don't want my kids to have to fear their parents. I do want them to respect us and understand our role as the household authorities. 

This whole thing gets me in a spiral of doom mindset which isn't helped by my depression and anxiety. I take meds and see a therapist. My therapist has, in the past, encouraged me to try and understand and respect my husband's perspective (how he was raised affecting how he might want to parent) but I don't my husband's approach is even socially acceptable in this day and age... Is it?"
StrangerSkies,2021-04-25 18:29:52+00:00,You don’t “have” to sleep train,"I got a lot of pushback for not sleep training my daughter. She had a rough time falling asleep and other mothers blamed me to my face for this. Instead, we co-slept for many years, and then around the time she was five, we moved into a place with separate bedrooms. 

For the last two years, we snuggle while she colors and I read to her for half an hour. Then I put on an audiobook, and we snuggle until she’s all the way asleep. Often, I end up napping for a bit with her. She wakes up around 1 am, comes into my bed, and curls up with me for the rest of the night. 

I cherish our bedtime routine, and the closeness it gives us at the close of the day. I am happy to keep that time sacred for her, to guide her into sleep with peace and gentleness. I love tiptoeing away once she’s fully asleep, and getting a last look at my favorite face in the world at the end of my day. 

It’s not a solution for everyone. But I just ran across a post where a tired mother was told she *must* sleep train her baby, and I wanted to offer what a few years down the road of not sleep training looks like for my kiddo and for me."

electriccweenie,2021-04-25 18:00:20+00:00,People keep making jokes about my son not being mine and it's getting old.,"Okay so my wife (white) and I (black + white) have 2 beautiful children. My daughter (4) looks almost exactly like me with the darker skin and the more black facial features. But my son (2) almost looks nothing like me. Has blondish hair and bright blue eyes. Still has some of my features but at first glance you wouldn't even know he was my kid. This has led to a lot of awkward staring from strangers. As well as the obligatory ""ask your wife about the mailman"" jokes. At first it was kinda funny,  ""Haha, yeah he's probably not mine"" but now it's just gotten old. 

And before you ask, no, my wife would never step out on me. Yes he's actually mine. Genetics are weird sometimes and you never know how the kid will end up looking. Especially for bi-racial people.

Look I know how to take a joke better than anybody. I'm in the Navy, it's basically in our job description... Maybe I'm being overly sensitive but it's starting to bother me more and more every time I hear it. My issue is how do I tell people to cool it without sounding like a dick or too sensitive?"
Jime2Shoes,2021-04-25 17:48:47+00:00,Teen Age Common Practices,"The girl I am dating has two teen age girls, 13 and 15. Since staying with her I have noticed things that they do that really grind my gears.

I consider myself a very laid back dude and I tend to not let much get too me. So I ask myself am I being picky or mean. That's why I'm here; to see if it's just me.

Here is just a small list of the type of things:

-Lie and manipulate their mother.
-never close the door after using the microwave.
-leave everything on all the time. Lights, TV, etc., Even while they are gone to school and such.
-don't flush after they use restroom.
-refuse to do any chores.
-want pets but never take care of them.
-never use the first thing up before opening another. There is 4 ketchups, mustards, miracle whips, sour creams, etc. In the fridge, all half used, and none grouped together. Same thing with the milk. 
-leave wrags and towels crumpled in corner till they smell like mold.
-the list goes on and on.

To me, they are the laziest, most unappreciative kids I have ever seen. I don't feel like we ask too much of them. Their mom gets on to them every day but never really punishes them and I feel it's not my place to but it's driving me crazy. I tried to get everything up to par and implement basic knowledge routines but it turned me into the maid. I'm not a clean freak but I'm a neat non wasteful person. 

Are my common Practices not so common? Is my bar to high or are these teens doomed to never be independent like their older siblings?"

palebot,2021-04-25 17:44:51+00:00,Son following a troubled kid at school.,"I say troubled because I don’t want to say a 5 year old is a bully, but our son, who is 4, seems to idolize this older child at their Montessori. From what we understand the older boy has some sensory issues that might contribute to an intense need for stimulation. But there also seems to be some other things going on at home that seem to feed into this or provide a vehicle for how he expresses this need. He’s violent and does violent things and says violent things. He tells the girls he wants them to break their arms. He throws things at kids. He pulls hair, and punches, and bites other kids. He always wants to play the bad guys. Etc. 

Well, our son loves older kids, especially ones who seem to go by their own tune. He has a lot of friends at school, but apparently is the only kid who plays with the older boy. And when he does he cheers the boy on and follows him. From what we understand he’s not hurting others but he’s still making poor choices.

Some other parents have seen the same issue and brought it up with their teacher, as we have. They’ve verbally discouraged their kids from playing with the boy. I can’t do that. I heard one little boy told him “my mom says I can’t play with you,” and the older boy was in tears. It’s heartbreaking. 

That said, we’re having a hell of a time getting our son to recognize his pal’s problematic choices and not think they’re the bees knees. We’re trying to handle some issues we hear about, realizing that most of the intel is stuff our son tells us or that his sister snitches: heresy from 4 year olds is no route to a solution. 

We’ve tried to go with, “if there’s a huge issue, the teachers will tell us and have a better sense of what’s happening at school.” But we just worry that this relationship is shaping his behavior at home. Given that he’s also going through a fairly natural defiant stage doesn’t help. And as my son, he might have a little ADHD, which I’m about 500 % confident I had growing up that was undiagnosed (and in hindsight explains a lot but also makes me even more committed to my son not having to have some experiences I had).

But we are running out of solutions to figure out how to convince him to make better choices. He’s too young to understand consequences fully, and he doesn’t understand that his friend has some issues. We’ve tried rewards, encouragement, trying to role play being a leader and kind, etc. He’s a sweet loving boy, but whenever the thought of his friend pops up, it’s like a trigger to perform being this boy.

Any suggestions or thoughts."

I just don’t want to be a mother. I never wanted children, but I was raped and talked out of an abortion. Sometimes I think, “I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have this child, I would lose my mind.” And other times I just wish I could give up rights to a family member or something.

sunshineandflipflops,2021-04-25 17:00:15+00:00,"Privacy and family advice needed, possible trigger warning.","So I am almost 16 wks pregnant and we had an anatomy scan Friday. 

I have a genetic abnormality that caused the doubling of my sex organs ( I have a double vaginal opening, doubled uteri, and 4 separate ovaries). From the scan my husband and I learned that our unborn son also has this genetic abnormality ( doubled penis, we are unsure  about everything else and will be seeing a specialist) 

I am a little on edge about it. I remember growing up and my genitalia being common knowledge among my family. I also remember feeling like a side show and a medical experiment. I felt like some sort of freak. When I was about 8 or 9 one of my uncles fingered me, he said he was curious, my dad nearly killed him ( yes, my uncle went to jail for it). 

When I started dating it was a source of embarrassment and insecurity for me. I was not okay with my genitalia being common knowledge at all. 

Now that I know that my son will have the same genetic abnormality I am very worried about it. I do not want my child to feel the way I felt. I talked to my husband about wanting our child's anatomy to be private, but he brought up the fact that someone in the family will most likely be babysitting. We can't control what they do with that information. I pretty much told my husband that I want it to be a need to know basis only. 


It scares me that everything I went through may repeat with my child. 

I know when he gets older it will be his decision as to who knows but I don't want anyone to know before my child is comfortable with his own body. 

Am I worrying too much? What should I do?"

I had never actually seen the movie straight through, just bits and pieces on HBO back in the day. (My mother didn’t like violent movies playing in the house, so I had to kinda watch it on the down low) Anyways I start Saving Private Ryan and I’m impressed/horrified by the first 24 minutes. But as soon as big battle scene was over, and Tom Hanks character started dropping words like ranger and quadrant, I just couldn’t take Saving Private Ryan seriously. Of course those phrases obviously fit the movie, but all I could think of was a certain space ranger for the gamma quadrant. From that point on every inspirational or emotional speech Tom Hanks delivered, was ruined by years of Toy story being burned into my brain. When the soldiers talked about duty, my brain went to Andy and all I could think was “ehhh get outta there solider, Andy will get over it, he can buy a new toy.”"

ennuiismymiddlename,2021-04-25 15:43:04+00:00,Water drinking,"Do any of you folks find that you have to actually NAG your kids to drink water throughout the day?  Our kids are 22, 17, 11, and 6 - and every last one of them would shrivel up like a prune if we didn’t nag/remind them to drink water all day long.  We don’t buy soda, but we do always have OJ in the fridge - and they will drink ONLY that, if left on their own - and not even enough for it to be hydrating.  

These kids will complain they have constipation, muscle cramps, headaches, etc- and then admit they haven’t had water all day and act like it’s not connected.  And get mad at us for constantly telling them to drink more water.  It’s crazy.  The 6 year old, I can understand.  He’s 6.  He needs us to remind him.  But the other kids have no excuse.  They don’t even complain about the taste of our water - they just hate water in general. 

I know there’s stuff you can add to water to make it taste different and sports drinks and whatnot, but why add chemicals and sugars if our water is perfectly clean &amp; fine the way it is.      And don’t get the wrong idea - I’m not opposed to other drinks.  I love many types of beverages.  But in my opinion, water should be the foundation of our hydration if it’s available to us.  How do I get my kids to understand this?  

I know in the grand scheme of things this is a very minor, first world problem.  Billions of people don’t have the privilege of having clean water running right out of the faucets.  And I AM VERY GRATEFUL that my family and I have access to it.   

I just wish my kids would listen to us and realize how important it is."

My husband(37m) and I(38f) were told at the beginning of the month that our autistic son had failed his vision screening, and we took him to see the eye doctor. He is very farsighted and needs to wear them all the time.

He picked out frames and a strap to go with them. The strap he ordered will arrive in 2 days. He likes the way he looks and knows that he sees better while wearing them. However, he told us that they are uncomfortable. Hence, he has left them on the floor many, many times where anyone, including his twin sister, can step on them despite attempting to explain that they need to go back in their case.

My husband and I have never worn glasses for this purpose and his sister doesn't need them (yet, could still happen). Other than the straps and constant reminders, what else can we do to make sure that our son wears his glasses? Any suggestions are welcome, thanks!"

When he was having trouble sleeping in his room we came up with a plan. He sleeps in his bed everyday during the week but gets to sleep in our bed with us on Saturday nights. This has worked well. Giving him one night a week helped him stay in bed the other nights. Lately he has been asking to come in our bed a lot more and when we tell him no he gets a sad look on his face and says, ""Do you still love me?"" We tell him that of course we love him and reassure him but when we bring him back to him room and tuck him back in he will ask again. He stays in his room after that but I am getting concerned that he feels unloved or uncared for. Are we handling this all wrong?"
FastL4n3,2021-04-25 14:57:50+00:00,Need advice for situation with 18 y.o autistic boy with a mental state of a young kid,"
I started seeing a woman and it became serious. She has an autistic/behind son who is 18 and is supposedly stuck at the mentality of a ten year old. He’s very closed off and spends all his time in his bedroom. He’s really depressed and every time I have tried to reach out to him I couldn’t get more than a few words out of him. His dad isn’t in the picture.

I have been spending nights at her place so we can sleep together and then one day out of nowhere this kid says if I come over he will stab me. His mom tells me this and that he is acting out. I go over anyways and he comes walking out of the apartment with a pocket knife and comes at me essentially trying to stab me. She has no control over him and is helpless to stop this. 

I did not call the police or fight him I just allowed him to chase me out and I haven’t been back in over a week because he says he will murder me if I do. I’m hesitant to involve police and he is closed off to any communication from me or her. Is there any professional help I can get? Does anyone have any recommendations? Please help this is destroying my relationship and I love this woman."

We lived one mile away from my mother in law who had my brother in law, his two children, and during the pandemic my two sisters in laws. Everyone worked from home and quarantined so our son continued to see his family until my two sisters in laws left to go back to college. Then my mother in law started to go out and so did everyone else while my partner and I quarantined with our son. We moved 3 states away for a job opportunity, it was a huge fit with my mother in law she claimed I was taking her son and grandson away. Fast forward 6 months we haven't seen any family and this summer will make it almost a year of seeing my sisters in laws. But one of them is getting married, very small wedding everyone will be vaccinated and masked. My partner and I have debated going but one sister in law and mother in law refuse to get vaccinated. For no particular reason either. Just saying ""we don't get the flu shot so why should we get the covid shot, we could survive if we got covid"". All past reasoning with so my partner told his family that after the wedding no one will be allowed to see our child unless vaccinated. I'm not even sure we should go to the wedding but am here for telling them that they will have to forgo seeing our child unless vaccinated. It has spurred enormous emotions and pretty sure it's going to blow up even more. But is that to much to ask or tell? Are we the assholes?"
ObjectiveCorgi89,2021-04-25 14:40:21+00:00,What were the earliest signs of ADHD or other behavioral things?,"Just wondering if my kiddo is just extreme, or if there is something else going on. He's always been extreme since he was little. Can never sit still at meal times, is a picky eater. He was a little speech delayed, but we figured it was due to the constant ear infections from 8 mo-13 mo (finally had tubes placed). He climbs and jumps and runs constantly. We just got a 4 mo old dog, and he's always grabbing and dragging, petting rough, can never sit still and be calm to pet. He IS a sweet, loving boy. But he's also so wild that sometimes it's not worth doing something because somehow he will make the experience less fun. I know that sounds terrible, but both my husband and I are at our wit's end. My MIL rised four boys, and she is constantly saying she's never seen such a 'wild' child before. 

I did send an email to his pediatrician this morning asking for a referral to a child psychologist, just to see. And get parenting classes so I can better deal with my own frustration towards parenting him. I can give more example as well, if it helps."
Cat_Proxy,2021-04-25 14:37:29+00:00,"I think my husband doesn't enjoy being a father, and I'm not sure how to help him.","Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?

Our son is 22 months. He got diagnosed with autism at 19 months (yes, it's early diagnosis, I'm not going into it because it's not relevant here, please don't question my doctor's decision, thank you). With the pandemic, we are on waitlists to get him therapies and into nursery school (which is currently closed), so we basically have him at home 24/7. He does speech therapy once a week for 30 minutes. The only person who comes to help is my MIL. She will babysit sometimes. It's more of a help for me than for my husband. He works from home. I'm the SAHM.

But yeah he's just not been himself. We've had divorce talks several times. I got him to attend couple's counseling with me. It feels like it's not helping. Once in a while, he starts to open up, and then he shuts down again so quickly that I only get a little bit of information. He says he's tired all the time. I think the responsibilities of our son is wearing him down, especially now with the diagnosis. Our son still wakes up a lot at night, and he's up at 6 am every day (which I think is pretty decent; it used to be 5 am before the time change!), but it kills my husband. Letting him sleep in does nothing, because he can't fall back asleep now. He wakes up at night and can't get back to sleep. He has stopped eating breakfast, says he has no appetite. I have begged him to talk to the doctor or a therapist, but he won't do it. It's been 6+ months of this, and he's just not making any effort. He's floating through our lives.

It's really sad. He had one day last weekend where he was laughing and happy and playing, and he seemed to be in such a good mood, it reminded me of what we are missing out on. Then he was back to his normal self the next day. On his phone every chance he gets. Tired. Lifeless. I can buy him free time, and it doesn't seem to make any difference. He said he didn't think this was going to be our lives with a kid, and I asked him, what did you think it was going to be? He said not this. He thought our son would be on a schedule, sleeping, going out often to grandma's house or daycare or whatever. Pandemic has really screwed everything up. He used to do soccer every week, and he hasn't been able to do that. He used to see his coworkers in-person, he hasn't done that (he started a new job right when pandemic started and has never been in the office). He used to go out once a month to D&amp;D, to a pub to see his former co-workers, etc. He can't do any of those things.

Am I stuck just waiting it out and hoping things get better after the pandemic? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? I keep telling him things will get better, but he doesn't believe me, and I don't know what to do. I hate seeing him like this."

IsEneff,2021-04-25 14:08:45+00:00,Should I care?,"TL:DR my sister is upset because I’ve asked to not have a graduation party the exact same weekend as my child’s graduation week. Mostly she’s upset because her child is also graduating and we aren’t going to “celebrate together.” Am I the bad guy?


Here the situation. I rarely talk to my sister, mostly on holidays when we go to my mothers house together. On Easter, my mother was in a mood and straight out told my daughter to plan for a date and time where she (my mom) could plan a graduation party. This is so my mother’s two oldest grandchildren can be celebrated at the same time despite the fact that the two grandkids have literally no relationship with one another. 

Further context: my mother and her siblings are very close. Growing up, my cousins were like siblings to me where some of them came to live with us off and on and various aunts/uncles have lived with us for long periods as well. So my mine is always trying to recreate her relationship with her siblings between my sister and me. After I graduated, I moved out of state to experience life on my own. Four years later I moved back and stayed with my parents for about a year until I got a place on my own with my then girlfriend and now wife. My sister and I were close, but as our directions in life changed we didn’t maintain a relationship. Her oldest is the same age as my oldest. My mom being a practical woman had joint baby showers. That was really awkward as many of our friends showed up lavishing us with gifts while very few showed for my sister. This is when I start to feel a little guilty. 

18 years later, my sister has had her ups and downs, mostly downs. She is divorced. She has chosen a career path that suits her antisocial behavior (cleaning buildings) and that doesn’t get a lot of income. I on the other hand have been driven to improve myself and while by no means rich, I’d qualify as lower middle class. This again makes me feel guilty for being successful and motivated while my sister struggles to pay bills and make ends meet. 

4 years ago, I told my oldest that we would take her to Disney World as a graduation gift. We’ve been putting small amounts of money aside and planning this for several years. This has drawn criticism from my mother who feels the money would be better spent on tuition. I also feel this is met with jealousy from my sister who hasn’t said anything directly but takes a very passive aggressive stance on these things. On Easter, my sister is berating her child with comments about going to graduation, attending the graduation party, and going to college (all of which her child doesn’t want to do). My mom pins down a date and time for graduation party the Saturday after graduation. We tentatively agree, it will be May 22nd. 

This week the school released the graduation schedule: Senior Breakfast, graduation rehearsal, graduation at a football stadium, project graduation. My wife and I begin to talk about pros and cons of doing a graduation party for my daughter both for her sake (busy schedule and almost no sleep) as well as considering that we are saving all of our extra cash for the trip to Disney 10 days later, as well as the risk of exposing us to the current pandemic from the hordes of family being packed into a house that can’t fit that many people in the same timeframe before our trip. 

And, to be clear, I recognize there is risk in taking my children to a crowded place like Disney. However, if we catch illness days before the trip that will make the trip miserable. 

This week, My sister texts all of us and asks what time the party will be. I ask if there is a way to consider moving it to after our Vacation. She says the weekend we recommended is her birthday weekend and that won’t work for her. I mention that we will be exhausted from two solid days of graduation events and cash poor since we are saving for vacation. She counters with her former in-laws coming from California (whom I’ve never met) to celebrate with our family. I reply that we can go, but that I won’t have the time or money to contribute for the selected date and time so it’s just a show up and celebrate. Her final text was “Mom will have to decide what she wants to do.” 4 days later and my mother still hasn’t brought it up. 

Enter the feelings of guilt again. I get that my sister isn’t taking her child on a vacation. Frankly, the one time my sister and her kids were taken to Disney by my mother they were miserable. Second, the dates we picked for this trip were centered around my mother going with us and her taking PTO. So we changed the original dates we picked and booked non-refundable flights. Then a month ago my mother backed out because she decided it was too expensive. So the dates for the trip centered around my mother who is no longer going. 

My other frustration is that in all of this, no one has asked either child what they want (we have, my child doesn’t want to go to a party that weekend) and are literally throwing this party for themselves and not the kids. My guilt is that if we don’t go, my family will paint it as us being both selfish and inconsiderate. They will frame the story as us being the bad guys to the rest of my family and fail to share the realities of our situation or concerns. 

Now with that context: I struggle with clear boundaries between myself and my family. We have different values and I have built a life with my five kids and wife. This is THE LAST CHANCE that I will get to take my kids as children on a family vacation. And yet I feel guilty and full of shame for wanting to have something special just for them/her. Should I care or am I falling prey to my families guilt tripping?"

thelonegunman88,2021-04-25 12:52:19+00:00,Transition of life for a 4 year old,"Ok so my fiancé and I are close to closing on our house and we’re kinda trying to figure out what the best way or course of action we should take to start telling her 4yo about it. She was with us the entire time we were house shopping but now it’s the real deal. 

She sorta knows that we’re getting a house and that it’s going to be the three of us living there but as far as the depth of her understanding what that means,  it’s hard to say. One minute it sounds like she gets it and is even ok with it but the next it really seems like she forgot everything we tried explain to her. 

I plan on moving in first and then they’ll come into the picture after my fiancé and I are married, just something traditional her and I wanted to do. 

This is the thing, her daughter finally mentioned about all the animals she grew up with and why she wasn’t going to be able to take them with her (her and my fiancé both lived with her parents who have animals.) Long story short the only animal she could possibly take is her cat. I’m deathly allergic to cats 🤧 my fiancé at one point was like... well if she can’t bring her can’t then you’re gonna have not bring your dog (this wasn’t a tit for tat instance it was just a very superficial option in the moment)... and I’m just like, no not happening. I’m not allergic to dogs and he’s outside anyways. I’ve had my dog for almost 8-9 years now. But this isn’t about length of time though. 

At this point we’re assuming the cat might have to be the key to making the transition smoother and less cumbersome. But we’re also just assuming it will be. I believe there could be other ways of making this transition better but it’s gonna be reliant on her own resiliency and just talking her through the life and dynamic change and less about the cat.

Has anyone else experienced this and lived to tell the tale? Or am I going to have to live the rest of my life with an IV in my arm dripping me allergy medicine? 

Thanks guys"
furlesswookie,2021-04-25 12:26:45+00:00,Anyone have a suggestion for a GPS device for children for an upcoming camping trip?,"Over the past several years, we have made a tradition of meeting up with several friends and enjoying a week of tent camping in the mountains. There's  8 kids among the families, ranging in age from 3-12. The oldest kid normally brings  a watch with him that has GPS tracking and limited cell phone capability, giving him the dubious honor of being the point person when we need the kids to return from whatever adventure they're on. We just found out that that family will not be joining us this year, so now I'd like to get a watch for my kids (7 and 4) so that they can run around the campground as normal, but still be in contact with us back at basecamp.

Anyone have a good reccomendation for a waterproof watch with GPS and cellular connectivity that is good for young kids? I'm on AT&amp;T,  but can be flexible."
hayden44e,2021-04-25 11:45:06+00:00,Separation Anxiety and/or Clinginess,"Hi everyone! Looking for some advice:

My 13-month-old daughter is very clingy. This is nothing new; she’s always been very attached to my husband &amp; I. She will only play independently for very short bursts but even then, my husband or I have to be nearby. She is constantly needing our attention and/or physical touch. 

This isn’t necessarily an issue, since I am a SAHM. But here’s why I’m a little concerned about her level of clinginess:

I have read that there can be a generic component to separation anxiety. My husband lost his mother at a very young age and distinctly remembers the negative impact it had on him as a child. He was already very attached to his mom and losing her exacerbated his already abnormal levels of anxiety. He firmly believes our daughter has inherited those same feelings. 

Additionally, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder years ago. Which means biologically, she’s certainly predisposed to anxiety issues of some kind. 

Whether or not she has separation anxiety, I recognize that she has always been far more attached to us than my 7yo son was as an infant/baby/toddler. 

I accommodate her needs as best I can but I still worry whether I’m doing enough or even doing the right things at all. I want to encourage independence while also validating her insecurities. I know this might seem silly for such a young child, but I am desperate to do the best I can for her. 

If anyone has any advice or guidance in this area, I would greatly appreciate it."
nttdnbs,2021-04-25 11:25:15+00:00,Son is picking up an attitude problem from daycare,"My two year old is in an in-home daycare with 4 other kids. We’re not happy with the lady that does it as is and are on waitlists for literally everywhere else, but so far no luck. I’m just saying that ahead of time because this may be influencing how I‘m seeing this situation.

In the past two months my son has developed a major attitude problem. He’ll get into people’s faces, point his finger at them and go „QUIET, KID“ or go „PSSSHHHHHH“, interrupting them. He‘ll do this to get attention when his dad and I are talking, or when we ask him to do things or are reading the wrong book - anytime he wants us to shut up essentially. He’ll also talk to other kids on the playground like this and chastise random people for no reason whatsoever.

We do not use these words or this tone in our household. While it’s not swearing or anything this is just not how we speak to each other. Not to him, not between my husband and I or even anyone in our extended family, nor have I ever witnessed any friends do that. So he can’t have it from anywhere but daycare.

I don’t appreciate that he’s being spoken to that way but mainly I do not want him to adopt this kind of behaviour. We’ve tried ignoring it and, failing that, firmly telling him he is not to speak to X in that way, but it’s just getting worse. He says it constantly now. 

Is this me jumping into „b*tch eating crackers“ territory or am I right to be annoyed about this? How do I get him to quit?"
You_Are_Doing_Great,2021-04-25 11:22:56+00:00,Who can I get to watch my newborn with specific medical needs if my wife isn't able to?,"I work a full time job while my wife stays at home.  We just had a child a few weeks ago.  They were born with several medical issues that required a good two weeks in the NICU.  We were just able to get her home with a lot of homecare supplies.  She needs a feeding tube, a strict feeding schedule, as well as specific medicines once or twice a day.  My wife had a C Section, so is still in a lot of pain.  She also just went back to the hospital because of pain, and found out she has an infection.  I've had to take more time off work to help care for both of them.

I feel super guilty calling off work.  We are short staffed as is, so I feel like I'm putting a strain on the team.  I was lucky enough to have extra managers as coverage these past few days, but there would be some days where I am the only manager on the floor.  If I wasn't able to come in, I don't know what we could do. It would be nice to get some more stability in our lives.  Assuming my wife recovers and is able to take over being a stay at home mom, we would be fine.  But what happens if she can't for whatever reason?

I know how to take care of our child, and all the medicines and stuff I need to do.  It's not as easy as hiring a babysitter and telling them these specific instructions.  We also don't have any family in the area to help, nor do we have any neighbors or friends we would trust.  It looks as if the only options I have is to take off work, which isn't ideal.

So what are my options?  Do you think any old babysitter could do everything correctly?  What is our plan B?"

ikaroa1,2021-04-25 10:28:14+00:00,What are the rules at the playground?,"So today I took my kids to the park, there was 2  swing sets. 1 with one of those rope hammock swings and a baby swing, and on the other side a baby swing and a big kids swing in a set.

When we got there my 18 month old wanted to go on the swing so I put him in and started pushing him. He was maybe on it for 1 minute when another kid, maybe 2.5 came up and wanted to go on it. Her brother, maybe 12-13 went on the big swing and I kept pushing my baby on the baby swing as he had only just got on and was enjoying himself, the others ones at the other side were still empty but I couldn't see my other kids playing from there so I didn't move him.

Anyway, the mother of the kids came up and instead of asking if her kid could go on the swing or just waiting until it was free, she stood behind me whilst I was pushing my baby saying, ""I know it's unfair that this other child won't get off so you can go on the swing next to your brother."" She said it about 5 times loudly over the course of 2 minutes, so I turned to her and said, ""We will be off shortly, there's another free set over there though if you can't wait a minute."" 

My baby was having a great time and had been swinging for around 3 minutes or so when I started getting uncomfortable with this mum standing right behind me talking about us to her child so I started to wind him down to hop off and move on.

Once I got him off, her kid didn't even want to go on the baby swing and was screaming she wanted to be on the big swing, I took my baby over to the slide and next minute, she's there with her kid, encouraging them to climb up the slide whilst other kids are waiting their turn to come down, when it got to my sons turn to go down her kid started climbing up again, so I asked her to hop off so the kids could come down. The mum got crazy irate and started shouting about how the mums at the park were trying to ruin her kids day by not allowing her to have fun.

It got me thinking, what is playground etiquette? I usually just tell my kids to wait there turn patiently for the swings or whatever and if the slides etc are being used I tell them they aren't to climb up... am I OTT or being unfair?"

My husband’s side of the family has a different approach. They basically tell me to leave her and not make a fuss. They tell her that if you’re not bleeding your fine. They do this with my niece and nephew too. 

They seem to imply I’m going to make overly sensitive by reacting every time she gets hurt even when it’s not that bad."

Just likes a little rock and a silly song before we put her down, maybe charge up her glow in the dark stars before we close the door. Well suddenly she doesn’t want any of it and refuses bed. Like scream and yelling “strawberry dog!” (A silly story character we made up that she loves). Tonight was the worst and I felt so defeated... is this a sleep regression? Or do you reckon she’s obsessing over this story character? Is there something we can do?"
icedzozo,2021-04-25 09:39:48+00:00,My toddler broke my nose,"Yes, that is right. My sweet little ray of sunshine 20 month old son managed to fracture my nasal bones after throwing himself backwards from standing up (he loves the bounce back from the couch), straight into my nose with the back of his head. There was blood, there was tears all from me). He escaped completely unscathed. I copped my first broken bone at the age of 27. 

I would absolutely love to hear of some other weird injuries other parents have experienced at the hands of their boisterous children! It’s been 5 days and now all I can do is laugh despite the pain."
Boc1992,2021-04-25 09:29:26+00:00,My 9 year old daughter is selfish and disrespectful - How do we change this behaviour?,"She is our only child and admittedly is very spoilt from the materialistic side of things. She has everything she wants, gadgets clothes, toys etc...

We are however quite strict with her in every other way. Bedtimes, homework and punishments are always stuck to and abided by. She knows if she steps out of line there will be punishments she hates (tech gone, grounded, earlier bedtime).

I notice this mostly when she is with her friends who are always polite to us and respectful... As I always was with my friends parents as a kid. But she will tell them they don't need to bother taking shoes off, or just to put the rubbish on the floor. It's just a general respect for the house and parents that I always seemed to have as a kid.

The main issue is that even at 9 years old she cannot share and will insist everything is not fair unless she is the center of attention. There is very little empathy for her friends and I'm scared as they get older they will realise this and not want to be around her anymore. 

I really sound like I'm complaining too much here, she is an incredibly smart hard working kid at school and is compassionate in other ways... But the lack of respect is driving us mad! Has anyone else in similar situations managed to change this behaviour?"

tarrpak,2021-04-25 08:44:02+00:00,"(M20) I'm terrified and very depressed as a new father, please help. (Long long post, I'm sorry.)","I had a difficult childhood; my father left my family when I was in 3rd grade and my mother was a heavy alcoholic. I was consistently neglected and ignored at home, never got home cooked dinners or birthday presents. My mom stayed drunk all day and night, so when she wasn't working she was passed out on the couch. My older sister ended up addicted to heroin, and my mom died of cancer when I was 17. I had a lot of trauma over the years that I won't bore you with, but this all led to a lot of mental illness.


A year after my mother died, I finally tried dating again due to loneliness. I met a girl off a dating app and we hooked up, and this somehow became a relationship. We didn't have much in common and weren't the best match in my eyes, but she was nice to me and treated me with love. 


This changed a month in, when her personality flipped. She became manipulative, vindictive, childish, and controlling. I won't get into details, but she is the most emotionally abusive/toxic person I've met. I stayed with her because I was scared of being alone, and she made me think that everything was my fault anyway. Not long after, she ended up pregnant.


I have never wanted children, I just wanted to exist in the background and be left alone. I'm very introverted and low energy, I don't enjoy socializing, I'm scared of commitment, I'm scared of family, I'm immature. All of my dreams are individualistic, and I am selfish. I only feel truly comfortable and safe when I'm alone.


I thought that once I saw my daughter, my perspective would change and I'd be filled with love and passion for fatherhood. However, she's now 2 months old and I feel no connection to her. I don't dislike her or blame her for my own problems, but my opinion on being a parent and my own happiness hasn't changed at all. 


I'm scared to have that much responsibility and impact. I know how much every little thing my parents did affected me, and the thought of someone else thinking of me in that way terrifies me. More importantly, I am not the type of person fit to be a father. My parents never parented me, so I don't know what to do or say. I don't even know how to act around kids/babies, they make me really nervous and uncomfortable. I'm just very mentally damaged, and unable to function emotionally.


Currently, I'm living with a friend, but he's moving away in 2 months. I'm from New Jersey and the cost of living here is ridiculous, so the only option I see is to move in with my girlfriend. To me, that sounds like hell. I have no career, no education; I'm living in a place I hate with a girl that makes me feel worthless. I have no family to support me, and no happy parts in my life.


While I have a sense of duty and pride to not be like my dad, I dread everything about my future and feel no connection to my daughter. I want to run away, but I know that I can't. Lately, I've been really considering suicide. Now would be the best time to do it, because she won't really have memories of me or the fact that I died.

I don't expect a solution, because the only solution to me would be adoption and that isn't possible. Life is just happening too fast, I thought I'd have more time to make mistakes and grow up. I just wanted a break. If anyone has any words of advice or consolement, please send them my way. 


Thanks"

2pineapple7,2021-04-25 07:26:29+00:00,Neighbor kid kissed my son,"My son is 5, will be 6 in July. He hasn’t really had a lot of chance to interact with other kids much. He had leukemia when he was 2-3, so we didn’t go anywhere and he didn’t play with the neighbor kids due to his compromised immune system. He did go to preschool for almost a full year before covid hit, then we went back to isolation for the most part. Now that things are calming down where we live, we have let him start playing with the neighbor kids. The first day, last weekend, he played next door while I sat in my backyard and eavesdropped across the fence. I heard the other kids (3 girls, ages 6,7 and 10) going on about how adorable my son is. Didn’t think anything of it. When he came home he told me that each of the girls kissed him on the cheek and forehead. I told him they must think he’s really cute, but that I think he’s too young to be kissing girls; I also told him that if he doesn’t feel comfortable with them kissing him, he needs to make sure the girls know that it’s not okay to try to kiss him. I told him a peck on the cheek isn’t a big deal to me but they don’t need to be kissing any lips and he seemed to understand and agree with me, I think he was really shy and embarrassed about the whole thing. 
Today he played with them again, the same girls, and when he came home he told me that the 7 year old kept trying to kiss him on the lips. 
I’m sure it was meant more playfully and not in a more mature “girlfriend” kind of way, but I’m still not super comfortable with it. 
Personally, I feel like he’s way too young for that (and she is too) but I’m just not really sure what to think or do. 
My son understands that I don’t want him kissing anyone on the lips, and I don’t think he necessarily wants her to be kissing him anyway, but I also know he has been kept away from other kids from most of his life so he probably doesn’t know how to react to this kind of attention, and I’m sure he wouldn’t want to say or do anything to make them not want to play with him anymore. 
I guess I’m just wondering what to do about this, or if I should even do anything. Is this normal for that age group? Am I wrong to be uncomfortable with it? Do I need to talk to her, or her mom?"
Terr0rBytes,2021-04-25 07:22:56+00:00,Any advice on how to help articulate tight clothes,"I m(39) have a son m(7) and I'm hoping for any advice on what I can do to help assess whether clothes on him are hurting him or are just tight fitting.

Sorry I'm finding this hard to explain.

Swimming.

Trunks and goggles.

They should be snug, they should be tight, but they should not cut in.

We have the experience to know something may be uncomfortable as they are very tight fitting for a purpose but I can't tell, and neither of us are able articulate if they are just tight or if they are truly hurting him. To him they just hurt.

I can stretch the trunks while on him with my finger quite a way before the elastic stops. So to me this is fine. But to him they hurt.

Same with the goggles. They only don't hurt him, his words, when there is an obvious gap in the sides, negating the purpose of them.

Wanted to know if there is any advice others could give me on how to ask or how to better see and assess clothing on him."
kiolly22,2021-04-25 06:22:40+00:00,Will I love this one as much?,"I am currently 6 months pregnant with a baby girl. 9 years ago I had my beautiful boy, I loved him more than anything and he totally changed my life. Weve been through a lot together as a single parented family, moved together and created a home together. 

Well I met my new partner two years ago and never saw myself having anymore children. But a few accidents later and here I am 😊 I was so happy intially, all be it a bit anxious. But recently I've realised just how much will change for my 9yo and just how much I appreciate and love him. He is just the the most energetic, sweetest and kindest little soul. I'm worried I am not feeling that for this baby, and if I ever will?

HowLovely23,2021-04-25 06:09:57+00:00,How to know what's normal for different ages?,"My daughter just turned 7 and I feel like a crappy mom lately.  I just realized, I don't really know this age and what to expect.  I worked at a daycare years ago, grew up watching my baby cousins and I have a degree in early childhood..

I felt like a rockstar mom from birth to about age 4.  But the last couple years, and especially now, I just don't know what's normal for her age, and what's not.  At 3, I knew tantrums were par for the course and I just went with it and felt confident in my parenting because I know toddlers act like crazy little dictators..  For the most part my daughter is a very good kid.  But she sometimes has the attitude of a teenager and still throws tantrums from time to time.  

I feel like I don't handle them well anymore because I don't know if she should be past this sort of thing, or if it's still totally normal.  She's my only, and most everyone I know has older kids.  I feel like I could deal with things better if I could say ok, I know this is normal and she's behaving exactly like a 7 year old...but I get so worked up and frustrated because I worry certain behaviors aren't normal for her age, and maybe I'm doing something wrong to contribute to the behavior.  

Is there a book or something to tell me this is how your kid will probably act at this age?  How does everyone handle behavior when you don't have experience with that age?"

I breastfeed and offer her food every two hours but she doesn’t seem to want to eat much. She will usually eat a little here and there about 3-4 hours. I’ve been offering her water as it’s warmer out and don’t want her to get dehydrated. She snacks on yogurt bites and baby puffs. We we’re doing baby foods but she’s not interested in the mushy stuff so I’ve just been breastfeeding. I’m not sure what made me notice or how exactly but the last 2 weeks of so I’ve been feeling her soft spot and noticing it dips down when she hasn’t eaten. She doesn’t seem dehydrated but I always try to get her to eat right away. She has usually 5-6 wet diapers. I need to keep better track but I’m just worried. Is it normal for it to be slightly sunken in between feedings? Her hair is also longer and it might be making the dip seem more noticeable because it’s wavy. I plan to try to get her in the doctor but until I can ease my mind. Even after she eats a lot at bedtime or for naps it’s not as dipped down but i can tell it’s lower after she doesn’t eat much. I’ve also been waking her up from naps or getting her in the middle of the night when I know she will eat more just so I know she’s getting good feedings. Any advice is appreciated! FTM and I don’t want my baby to get dehydrated while teething and not very interested in eating much!

-treadlightly-,2021-04-25 04:00:47+00:00,Help me tech my son how to stand up against unwanted touch,"We live in Louisiana. People are very friendly and generally feel that you can walk by and touch children you don't know. This week while picking up food, a restaurant owner we'd never met walked by once and sort of rubbed my 6 year old son's head (think grabber type head massager) then did it again when he walked by again. I told my son it's ok if that made him uncomfortable, we wouldn't do that to someone else we don't know, and he shouldn't do it to us. I told him it would make me uncomfortable. But I didn't say anything to the man to stop him, so I want to walk it back and teach my son how to stand up for himself. And at the very least I want the words to say FOR him next time instead of just doing nothing.

Then, as it must've been a prime parenting day, I took him to see my grandmother and the caretaker that he had never met. The caretaker wanted a photo with him, and completely against everything I've taught him, I asked him to please do it instead of asking him if he wanted to/was comfortable doing it.

I just screwed up that day. I told him I messed up. He was clearly uncomfortable with both events. We have NEVER EVER encouraged hugs or anything with other Edpeople including family. As we leave it up to him and help him say no when he doesn't want to, he usually doesn't hug much of anyone but us (even pre COVID I mean).

I could use help teaching him and me the words to ask a strange adult to stop touching him. And welcome other words to teach him what I should've helped him say when the caretaker wanted a photo with him. It should be as simple as asking him if he wants to and helping him say no when he doesn't, I just completely screwed up. 

TL;DR: what should a child or parent say to an unknown adult that touches their child? How do you help your child say no to things like taking a photo with someone when they don't want to?"

The exact scenario is this- kiddo is four months old, mostly formula fed. He ate earlier and fell asleep in his crib. He woke up, clearly a hungry cry so I fed him a little 60ml bottle. He didn’t fall asleep so I figured I’d make another 120ml bottle. By the time I finished, he was out. So, the bottle never touched his lips and was just made. Fiancée suggested putting it in the fridge since he didn’t touch it. Maybe five minutes between making it and putting it in the fridge.

When we wake up in the morning, can I warm the bottle and give it to him? How do I do that? Do I treat it like a normal bottle? Shake it before warming or after? I really don’t want to waste formula if I don’t have to. It gets so expensive!

brkrpaunch,2021-04-25 01:57:58+00:00,No children here: Question about my own upbringing and my Dad,"TLDR:  How should my Dad have responded when a youth coach neglected the wellbeing of a child?

Effectively I understand how he reacted: He was always visibly and audibly upset.  

I played youth soccer in my town frequently growing up.  One season when I was about 9 or 10 years old I was on a team that practiced in a more remote part of town.  My dad was a teacher and worked somewhat later.  My mom was a nurse and frequently worked nights.  I think this was maybe 1994 or so.

Sometimes after practice, I remember this particular coach just sort of clocking out and taking off with his son right at 6 or 7 PM or whenever practice ended.  

I know for a fact my Dad had told this guy ""Look, there's sometimes when I can get there right when practice ends.  But I will never be more than 10 or 15 minutes beyond that so just hang tight, please.""

But the coach never did.  Like sometimes he might have waited 5 minutes.

Then, when my dad would roll up, to find me and (sometimes) a couple other kids hanging by themselves in the dark, around these soccer fields.  He would get about as mad and as irritated and as perturbed as I'd be able to see from him.

But he'd tell me to be more assertive, as if I'm supposed to supervise the coach.  Or he'd question me about what happened leading up to the coach's departure.

I presume he didn't pull me off that soccer team because he didn't want to punish me for what was the neglectful coaches fault.  I also presume he called the coach to chew him out or reinforce his request to look out for the wellbeing of all the kids.  But what is the correct response here.  I'm just curious about what parents would do."

My mom (72) has been battling stage iv cancer for five years. It recently progressed significantly and she’s near her very end. I live across the country from her. Literally I’m on the west coast, she’s on the east coast. 

I am married with a four year old. My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer about six months ago. 

In the last month, my mom has been hospitalized 3 times. I’ve flown back and forth across the country four round trips (8 times in three weeks). 

This last time, I got a call with my dad sobbing and telling me she’s about to go. My brother, who is a 40 year old narcissist and childless that lives at home, told me that I need to come home and nothing else matters (alluding to my wife’s cancer). He’s said some other awful things too, basically saying he doesn’t care about her cancer, but that’s for another therapy session. 

I need advice. How do I navigate this situation?? In my heart I feel like I know the answer—prioritize my wife and child first and foremost, and come when it really is a dire situation. I already said goodbye to my mom and feel at peace with it. 

I just can’t shake this guilt. Damned if I do damned if I don’t. But really damned if I don’t take care of my daughter and wife during her treatment. Right??

My dad is not self sufficient. I know that if I choose my wife and daughter my brother will use it against me and will tell my dad that I’m a bad son who failed his moral obligation. By the way my dad does not know about my wife’s cancer. 

Any thoughts from this group?? I feel like I know that being a father is the most important priority. I suppose I’m looking for confirmation of it."

Our two-year-old is waking up super early every morning--around 5 am. I feel we have tried a variety of stuff, but no matter what, she still wakes up at that time. 

* Her bedtime was at 6:30p, so we moved it to 7p.
* We have moved to one nap per day
* She has a weighted blanket
* Sound machine her whole life
* Blackout curtains (though she woke up early before it was light in her room)

We have a 4-year-old with a bed right next to her room, so while we normally would let her cry it out, we don't want to wake her sister. This is her first time with sleep issues. She was crushing the sleep from 6:30 pm-7 am for a long time so we are not sure what's going on. First sleep regression? 

Any advice? Thanks!"
SanFranPeach,2021-04-25 00:04:21+00:00,Pregnancy and chronic pain?,"Hi Parents!

This might be a long shot but I’ve always been very curious.

I’ve had undiagnosed chronic neck for 10 years. Daily pain, doctors have sent me down worm holes, no relief but I continue to try and find a cause/solution. Anyway, I have a 6 month old baby and my neck pain was very low almost the entire duration of my pregnancy. 

I’ve heard some theories about the relaxin hormone but I’m curious if anyone else has heard of or experienced this? There were no other correlations other than being pregnant (ie my exercise, lifestyle, eating habits, no medications, etc all stayed the same). 

Thank you!"
Tnt540,2021-04-24 23:59:22+00:00,Advice to help my 20 month old talk more,"Hello! SAHD here. I’m looking for things to help get my daughter talking more. She currently only says around 15/20 words. (Mama/dada/hi/baba/dog/ball/(dogs name) etc. I think COVID lockdowns in addition to my wife and I living 500 miles away from family are the biggest contributors to her lack of speech. We don’t have many friends here so we stay at home quite a bit. I’ve admittedly slacked on the book reading a bit because she doesn’t seem as interested in them anymore. She’d rather play with other things, like her building blocks. She has previously been ahead on other milestones, like crawling and walking. I know all babies are different and speech usually doesn’t become a big issue until about 2 years, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m failing her as a parent in this particular area. I already ask her to say things as we interact with them (things like spoon, door, shirt, etc) and sometimes she’ll make an attempt at saying them but only really pronounce the first letter of the word. Other times she won’t try at all. 

Any advice would be appreciated."

We got about 5 minutes in before she said her belly hurt, so we tried turning on music and having her sing, having her name car colors, and sip some water.

hoopahDrivesThaBoat,2021-04-24 23:04:51+00:00,2 year old whiniest baby ever,"Honestly... I WANT to love my kid more than oxygen... but for the most part I hate being around her. I hate saying it to a boatload of strangers... but much better than to my wife.

She had colic for the 14 months. It was awful. Maybe the worst year in my life. Since then she’s been better. Has plenty of time where she is happy (if she is watching TV, eaten frozen chicken Nuggets, or some other terrible thing we shouldn’t give her but we’re just too tired).. but she also cries a lot more than I’ve ever heard of.

Cries at bedtime. Cries when she wakes up. Cries on the way to daycare. Cries when she doesn’t get what she wants. Cries when she gets what she wants. Cries if we don’t change the channel to exactly what she wants. Cries when it’s time for a bath. Cries when it’s time to get out of the bath. Cries when it’s time to get dressed. Cries when it’s time to get undressed. I want to say that in a 12 hour day she probably is actively making some crying or whining noise for no reason for maybe 6 of those hours. 

Hoping someone can share stories of how, even at two, they know of a ton of kids that are just unspeakably unhappy half or more of the time. I want this to be normal and I want to figure out how to be OK with it so I can just love my kid instead of love and absolutely resent her."

MinuteJuice,2021-04-24 22:19:23+00:00,"My son (15) is turning into a controlling boyfriend, can I stop it?","Hi!
So my son(15) has his first girlfriend and they’re pretty serious about each other (going out for 6 months). It’s clear they are very much in love and it’s mostly super cute. She stays with us most of the time because she has a difficult family life.

However, I‘m noticing some increasingly controlling and disrespectful behavior from him towards his gf. He always puts his needs before hers (e.g. she‘s hungry and he ii to watch TV so he‘ll tell her „you can eat after this movie“), tells her she‘s not allowed to eat meat anymore (he‘s a vegetarian), decides when to go to sleep, eat etc. I told him in her presence that he can’t decide such things for her and that her opinions matter as much as his but I can’t seem to get through. I told them what she eats is her decision but she said she didn’t want to anger him so she complies with what he says. 🚩 🚩
He also always wants her full attention even when he’s doing something else (like gaming) and is angry at her when she does something else like look at her phone while he‘s busy. He even takes away her phone but he can look at his own phone whenever he wants.

My husband and me have a great relationship, we respect each other tremendously, rarely fight and this is just not what we are showing him. If my husband treated me like that I’d be gone in the blink of an eye. We thought teaching him about relationships by example would be enough to make a decent partner of him but I‘m really really worried that he‘s becoming a toxic and controlling partner to the poor girl. I already told her that she shouldn’t let him control her and her opinion matters as much as his and she just said something like „well, I do things to keep him happy, it’s ok.“. She also now does his household chores. I told them she didn’t have to and she said „it’s ok, I don‘t mind“ while he said something like „well if she doesn’t mind it and I do, why should I do it?“ 😩

How do we get through to him? I asked my husband to talk to him 1-on-1 to give him a male perspective. Or do we just let them figure it out themselves?

Btw she’s not meek even if it sounds like it here and sometimes does talk back to him which we encourage, but we think she’s afraid to lose him so she complies a lot. They also fight a lot but he always „wins“ because he’s the most stubborn person I know and never backs down."

ittybittymomma,2021-04-24 21:28:28+00:00,Toddler being a bit much. I’m at my wits end.,"Hi everyone. I could use either advice or encouragement tbh, because I don’t have anyone else I can turn to for it. 

My 3 year old is going to be the death of me. She’s blind, just to preface this. So, she develops a bit differently or later with some things. I’ve kept that in mind her whole life and been as patient as I can manage, which has become difficult lately. 

She has always had drinking issues and feeding issues. The drinking issues are the problem I’m having today. That’s why I’m in tears. And before anyone suggests talking to her ped or another dr, she has a team of them who are all well aware of her issues. She just doesn’t drink on her own. Doesn’t lack the ability, just outright refuses to. I know there’s a saying “if they’re really thirsty/hungry, they’ll drink/eat”. Yeah, we’ll, I’ve found that’s not true at all. If I don’t somehow get water into her, she won’t drink at all. I’ve left cups all over the house in her common spots, I’ve handed them to her directly, I’ve tried fun cups, I’ve tried regular open cups, I’ve tried despairing syringing water into her mouth. Lately, she just spits it out or blows bubbles. I try to curb this by giving her special bubble blowing time, where she’s free to blow bubbles in a big bowl of water. It’s not working. I’ve gotten water all over her, my floor and me. She just plain spits it all over herself and doesn’t care. She laughs. Nothing I say or do is making it better. Then if I get more firm (without raising my voice), she shouts or hits. I firmly hit gently stop her and tell her she’s being too loud. But she just doesn’t listen. It’s almost like she can’t hear me but her ears work perfectly.

I feel like I’ve failed as a mother. She used to have a tube...and I worry if I fail any longer that she’ll have to get it again. When she’s perfectly capable of drinking, because she’ll do it at night when she’s asleep. I’ve just broken down sobbing after the fourth time of getting wet just today. I can’t hold it in anymore. If there’s anyone out there who has lived something close to similar, can I get a shoutout? I feel like I’m alone."
halfsassit,2021-04-24 21:03:57+00:00,8F Daughter refuses to compromise and has massive tantrums about it,"I'm losing my mind here. My daughter has recently decided that she'd rather have screaming tantrums than compromise. Several times a week, she won't get her way and instead of picking from one of several other good options, she ignores all our warnings about whining and arguing and will not let go of wanting to do whatever it is she wanted to do in the first place. We explain our reasoning for why she can't do the thing and offer at least two other choices (always things she likes). She won't hear of it. She comes up with solutions so that she can get her way, usually solutions that don't work. We explain again the reasoning and offer other choices. She starts crying and digging her heels in worse, so we offer one good choice and one bad choice (timeout in her room, often the loss of electronics or playing outside). She digs her heels in more, and so she loses her choices and goes to her room until she can calm down. She scream-cries in her room, which she knows isn't okay since we have thin floors and lots of neighbors who don't want to hear this. (We have told her nine million times that it's okay to cry when you're upset, but it is not okay to scream. Screaming is for emergencies.) Eventually she calms down and comes out all tearful and asks again for the thing we initially said no to, and then we repeat the cycle at least once more, and usually by the end of this she's lost a privilege or two because she refuses to listen. We're at the end of our ropes, and I feel like we're doing all the right things in this situation and nothing is helping. I've been going out of my way to spend more time with her, stay calm when things get heated, really listen to what she's saying instead of brushing her off, etc. It often gets dragged out for an hour or two, and all her sense goes out of her brain. We frequently point out that she's choosing to be sad by focusing on how upset she is about not getting the one things she wants instead of choosing something else that she likes and being at least mostly happy. We can't get through to her that we can't make her be happy and she can't have whatever she wants all the time, which is not new. I'm absolutely baffled that she'd actively choose to lose things she loves and spend time in her room crying than compromise and go with a second or third choice that wouldn't ruin everybody's day, especially hers. If this were 6-8 months ago, I'd chalk it up to all the stress of online school and being stuck inside, but she's back to in-person school (which she's been looking forward to since last March) and the weather is nice so she's been playing outside every single day. I don't know what to do. Please help!"

Her sleeping and eating is manageable at night, but she can be a tiny demon during the day, not sleeping for up to 7 hrs sometimes. Rather than demand feeding we are now on a strict 3-4 hourly feed scheduale and needs to be held upright 30 min after eating. 

We are also trying to be mindful of our own mental health and there is a band playing in the city our parents live in this coming weekend. We were going to drop her off late arvo and aim to pick her up by 11. It would be the first time we'd be away from her for more than an hour since birth (she's 3 months old) and we were keen for some us time. She also sleeps and dream feeds from around 7pm-7am, so theorically not too much work for grandparents to look after. They are still keen to look after her too and don't need to give her any medication. 

My concern is I'm feeling guilty about leaving her so soon after figuring out her issue and leaving hospital. I'm also worried now about any big changes to routine will unsettle her and that grandparents won't do it the ""right"" way, i.e. ""my way"" (I know right...eyeroll at myself).

In all these years together my parents have been very involved grandparents.  My dad is an amazing grandpa and even though I thought my mom was the best growing up, she's an even better grandma.  My parents' house is like a second home to my kids and I love that they are so close.  

My husband's parents couldn't be any more opposite.  They weren't very attentive parents according to my husband so it makes sense that they wouldn't change with kids.  My kids see them maybe once a month and that's if there's some other family thing going on like a holiday get together.  When i worked and needed a sitter on a rare occasion, his parents were never available and I got every excuse in the book.  They just never seem to care if they see the kids or not.

What irks me though, is that my husband's sister has a 4yo and his mom is always watching her kid.  She posts pics of them together on Facebook.  My SIL has split custody with the kid's dad so she only has him for half of the month but you'd better believe my MIL soaks up every bit of him that she can.  What sucks is now that my kids are getting older, they're starting to notice.  My daughter was in dance for about 5 years and my MIL only ever went to maybe 2 performances.  My in-laws have missed birthdays and other such things for my kids.  But you'd better believe they wouldn't miss anything for my nephew.

I don't even know what I want out of posting this.  I guess to get it off my chest?  I've talked to my husband about it but he doesn't like opening up about hard feelings.  He rarely reaches out to them anymore and since he doesn't, he rarely ever hears from them.  I just don't get how people couldn't care about family because mine is so close."

SnickersDadBot,2021-04-24 16:45:10+00:00,"How will we deal with the ""end"" of the pandemic?","TL;DR: My wife and I will be fully vaccinated in a couple of weeks, but I don't know how much we should relax and allow our kids to socialize if they themselves won't be able to get vaccinated for ages. I also don't know how to help the kids transition back into having a pre-pandemic social life, especially my 3 year old, who missed out on a lot of learning opportunities this past year. 

**I highlighted the important stuff because I know it's a massive wall of text.**

Hi. **I have 4 kids, ages 15, 12, 10, and 3. We've all been staying home for 13 months.** Thankfully, our country is making a lot of progress with the vaccination campaign. **I'll be getting my first shot at 5pm today, and my wife will get hers on Thursday**, so we're now looking at a future where we're both vaccinated.

The thing is, **I'm not sure what we can start doing again after we've gotten both shots, because of course our kids aren't vaccinated, and they probably won't be for a very long time (especially the younger 2)**. Now I know that the risk is much lower for kids, but a) there's still a risk, especially for Long Covid, and b) I don't want them running around infecting a bunch of other people, especially when variants are a thing.

There's a couple of other things we'll definitely do, for example visiting grandparents (and relatives in general). We've basically only done video chats since the start of the pandemic, but since my mom and my wife's parents are fully vaccinated themselves, we feel like it's fine.

**We want to at least expand our (and our kids') bubble a little bit, but we don't know how much of it is safe and where to draw the line. The kids have had masked play dates with one specific friend each, but I don't know how much we should allow now, and under what conditions.** Both of my girls (15 and 10) eventually want to have a party with friends to make up for their Covid birthdays, but we feel like that's way too early.

Safety issues aside, even if the kids were fully vaccinated today, **I'd have no idea how our family would adjust to things going back to ""normal"". Since all of my kids only have one friend to hang out with in person, they've really only been able to develop their friendships with that friend.** Of course that doesn't mean they aren't friends with the others anymore, but I feel like it will be hard for them to find their way back into a group and catch up with the others. Especially since some of their friends have had some hard feelings about them choosing a different friend as the one to hang out with during the pandemic (which I understand, it sucks feeling left out). **It'll be a major adjustment period, especially for my 10 year old, who's already going through some changes, and friendships are super difficult to navigate at that age.**

I mainly worry about my boys, though. **My 12 year old isn't super outgoing, and while he's very close with his best friend now, I don't want him to rely on only one friend throughout his teenage years. Of course we won't know how much this covid/social distancing stuff has affected him until things truly go back to normal, but I've got some reasons to assume he'll be more anxious about it and have a harder time trying to make friends**. Does anyone else have a kid who's similar to him? **How are you planning on making things easier and helping them with this kind of stuff?**

**My little one (he will be 4 in June) obviously hasn't had the time to learn how to play with kids his age. He plays with his siblings and with his friend (who's 6, though**, so not at the same developmental level), but we were originally planning to send him to pre-school in the fall of 2020, **so that he could learn how to really play with kids who are at the same level of verbal and social development as him. I'm kinda worried about what will happen when we do try to let him play with a bunch of other toddlers again. He can get pretty frustrated when things don't go his way in a game, and I feel like it'll be worse when he plays with kids his age, rather than kids who are way older, can express themselves verbally, and help him talk things through.** I don't want him to get frustrated and hit the other kids at pre-school, throw toys, etc. **Basically, I don't know how to make up for the year of social development that he missed.** Thankfully he at least doesn't seem to be afraid of other kids or anything like that (he's dying to play with the neighbor kids).

**Another thing is that my oldest daughter (15) will most likely have to go back to in-person school soon.** The other kids are home-schooled, but she's in distance learning (long story), and they're basically talking about scrapping the distance learning program entirely and going back to full in-person learning (I know, we are pretty lucky that they held out for that long in the first place, a lot of districts went back to in-person learning like a year ago). I hope they at least wait till the school year is over, and things will probably look a lot different in late August, but **I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be with her going back in person at this point.**

What are you guys' thoughts? I know, many people probably won't agree with our decision to go to this extreme with social distancing in the first place. **Those who did something similar, how do you decide when / how much to relax, and how will you help your kids make up for what they missed out on socially, once this pandemic is officially a thing of the past?**"

sunset2020,2021-04-24 16:02:24+00:00,Help. I just can't handle my 8yo anymore.,"TW: suicide. I straight up don't know what to do with my almost 8 year old. His behavior is triggering me in ways that give me suicidal ideations and I just straight up don't know what to fucking do.

For context my kid has something. Don't know what. Maybe anxiety, maybe depression, maybe OCD, who fucking knows? Apparently you can't officially diagnose kids this young. He was in therapy for a year, she talked with him and taught him coping skills (that he rarely used) and it didn't help. He's not violent or aggressive at all, he's just insanely whiny and cries about every fucking little thing all the fucking time. Okay not ALL the time. His case of idk-what-the-fuck-ever-it-is isn't even close to what most parents have to deal with in their kids. But I literally cannot deal with it anymore and have had literal thoughts of suicide. 

My husband is much better with him than me and very supportive of me, but I'm primary caregiver. I work part-time on weekends but am looking for a full-time job literally just so I am not around him the entire day. His school is in person for 2 hours in the morning. We also have a 3 year old.

There are no resources. Like what am I supposed to do? Apart from admitting myself into a fucking hospital (which I feel would be a colossal waste of everyone's time and valuable resources) what do I do? I've talked to his doctors, a developmental pediatrician is supposed to be getting back to us and hasn't yet. But even then it's like ""Ya he fucking whines and loses his shit over everything,"" like what's the doc supposed to do with that? He's not ""extreme"" enough to be taken seriously I feel like, and I also feel like the biggest issue is me and how it triggers me to no end and I can't fucking handle it. (I am on an SSRI for depression.) 

I just don't know what to do."

McClippz,2021-04-24 15:38:19+00:00,Child Will Not Sleep.,"Hello parents ,

My Wife (28) and myself (29) are literally hanging on by a thread . Our youngest of two children (3) will not sleep . Not only will she not sleep through the night , but when she does fall asleep every hour she wakes up for at least 20 minutes to scream for someone to go in there.

When I try as the father to go in there , she screams louder and will only excite herself more until Mom comes in there. I feel so bad for my wife getting roughly around 4 hours of sleep a night according to her watch .

We have brought this up to multiple doctors, and even had a sleep study done . But to no avail we have had zero luck , most of them shrugging us of telling us that her breastfeeding at night is the only reason for her lack of sleep. 

We have looked into multiple recourses and continue to use practices that were suggested ..... we have a nighttime routine , we have a dark room , a white noise machine , we provide night lights . We have tried bed early and later  and even melatonin . We really are at the ends of our ropes and struggling .

For the last week as an example she woke up at 2 am and stayed awake until 7 am. Refusing to go back to sleep , finally so dead tired took a 30 minute nap , and is now awake again.... but dead tired 

The lack of sleep is effecting her behavior as she gets unbelievably aggressive when she is tired (which is 90% of the time) . She refuses to nap and becomes combative , violent and will not listen .

Please if you have any advice I would love to hear it . 
TIA

Tldr: Child won’t sleep , is aggressive , have asked for medical help but it’s not working ."

The_Yodacat,2021-04-24 15:12:49+00:00,Kids handle death better than most people think. Adults are the ones with the hang-ups.,"When the day comes you need to explain death, think hard about why it's so difficult. Kids may not fully understand or accept the permanence of it, but they'll ""get it"" and probably ask questions that make *you* the uncomfortable one in the conversation. Have they smushed a bug? That was a learning opportunity. Take the opportunity early to explain that the bug's body doesn't work anymore. It won't see or feel or think thoughts anymore. Then when the time comes, whether a pet or family member, that foundation is laid. Children can handle most of the heavy burdens of life more than people give them credit for. Don't even be afraid to lean on them when the time comes. That last part is from personal experience."
Gingersnapandabrew,2021-04-24 15:10:31+00:00,My husband is getting ready to deploy and I'm scared,"My son has just turned 2, he doesn't talk much, so I am not sure how much I can explain it to him, or how much he can understand either, but Daddy is about to go away to the other side of the world for a few months. With the time zone change, he will only be able to talk to him at weekends as he will be at work when our son is awake in the week. I have no idea how he is going to be affected by it.   


Throughout the whole lockdown situation, I have been working full time from home, so my son is used to having me at home all the time, but working. Whereas, my husband was working shifts, so was at home and able to play and be the ""fun parent"" more often. He asks for ""Dada"" when he wakes up in the morning, and always wants Daddy to tuck him into bed at night. When my husband has gone to work before my son has woken up in the morning, he runs around the house looking for him for ages until I can explain to him that Daddy has gone to work and will be home later. I don't know what he's going to do when Daddy goes to work and doesn't come home for months.   


On a selfish point of view, I don't know how I'm going to cope either, how I will cope with tantrums without a back up, how to do bathtime without a second pair of hands when he refuses to get out of the bath even when the water is cold and the bubbles are long gone, how to get him to sit and eat his dinner when he wants to run outside when its raining. So many times my son tantrums for ages with me, until my husband walks in and then he stops as soon as he gives him a cuddle. I don't know how single parents do it, you are all stronger than I will ever be.   


We moved to a new place (not out of choice) half way through lockdown last year, and due to all activities being shut down due to the ongoing situation, I haven't met anyone other than my next door neighbour. I have contacted the support services here, and they have said they will let me know when things reopen, but they don't know when that will happen. I've moved away from my friends at our last Station, and our closest family are over 100 miles away, so its going to be hard. The last time he was deployed I was pregnant, so I've never done this before.

DobroMoutro,2021-04-24 13:58:37+00:00,My 4y.o daughter was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. I feel lost.,"Hello r/Parenting. Long-time lurker here. I need to apologize in advance in case my text is a bit unclear. I am not an English native speaker and am currently very emotional which makes things even worse.

Here is my story. I am a 33 years old single father. After almost 2 years of harsh legal battles with my daughter's mother, I managed a year ago to establish a stable communication program with my daughter. My life turned instantly from total misery to total happiness. I now have my daughter 14 days per month and this stability made my depression evaporate. Nothing could bring me down anymore in day-to-day life. I love my daughter more than anything and we have a really strong bond since I was very involved from the moment she was born. 

Everything good, right? Well, yes, until this week. My daughter has been complaining of pain in her foot frequently since she was 2. Mostly later in the evening or she would wake up after going to bed. At first, we didn't think much of it. We thought it might be growing pains and our pediatrician wasn't very concerned. But the pains kept being very frequent at rates of maybe half of the nights she would wake up and we had to give her painkillers. Recently we decided we had to look at this further, visited other pediatricians, and long story short, after many blood tests, MRIs, and visits to pediatric rheumatologists she was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). I somehow knew deep inside that it wouldn't be something simple all that long but yet again it hit me like a train. From the information I gathered and was given by the doctors it seems it's a lifelong illness and patients often have many difficulties in life due to this. I don't even wanna think how bad it can develop in some cases. The go-to medical prescription for this case is Methotrexate, which is an immune-system suppressant used in treating illnesses like cancer, autoimmune and rheumatoid diseases among others. Some of the side effects are GI problems, dizziness, drowsiness, hair loss, and others. We were also suggested taking the injection version of the drug as it is more effective. This makes things even worse since she already had quite a few blood tests the past few days and is scared of injections at this point.

I don't know how to feel. I mean, I'm devastated thinking of all the bad things that could develop but maybe they are just the worst-case scenarios? After finally managing to bring emotional stability to my life and being happy, I feel knocked over. All the darkness from the past has now resurfaced but the fear for the future is so much worse. Is there anyone that has any experience with JIA, being a patient, or having someone close? What is it like in reality long term? I know I need to keep positive and not let my daughter feel my sadness but how do you suggest I handle it? Having to deal with this along with her mother, who is very hostile against me makes things even worse but I can handle this. To be honest, I have managed to take aside my personal feelings for her and try to be as much supportive of her I can be, as she seems to be in need of this too but as soon as I have a different opinion I am being diminished to useless, careless and an egoist.

Please, let me know what you think, anything that you feel might help. I feel lost. Thank you for your time."

Anybody else experienced this or know someone? Can you call this ""raising two kids with two different lives""?

Hi everyone,
So my situation is really complicated but ill try my best.

I've always looked forward to graduating and going to prom, I’ve been watching high school live graduations for 5 years, same thing with watching prom vlogs and even choosing dresses for my own :)

Anyway I live in a small hellhole town with my father because of his job, and my school is a horrible place, they're not hosting a prom or a graduation, not because of corona but they're just ignoring us because no one even cares and everyone hates everyone and the school is horrible in every aspect, prom is the only problem.

We're originally from the city, both my brother and mother moved back to the city two years ago and they wanted me to go back with them but I refused to and I would always say that I hated how crowded and busy the city was(I lied)
About eight months ago I really wanted to move to the city because I really hate this town and I wanted to go to a good school and I even started with the transferring process but I didn’t move because I didn’t want my father to live here all alone which is the real reason I didn’t wanna move with my mother and brother but I never tell them.
Now I'm a senior in high school and I’ve been crying over the fact that I won’t be having a prom or a graduation ceremony I’m literally going crazy!!
And also the fact that I’m graduating from here????? I’ve NEVER thought this would ever happen, I’ve always hated this place with every single fiber of my being AND I was the one who chose to stay here and for what? For my father who now tells me that I’m ungrateful and uncaring about everyone around me?
Whenever I open up to him about my depression because I live here he says I’m just ungrateful and lazy because I wanna blame someone else for my mistakes.
It drives me crazy that I’ve wasted all my high school years and I let go of the only thing that I’ve always been looking up to (prom and graduation) for him just to say this to me.
Now I feel like I just can’t do anything, I can’t move on and I don't know what to do"

For the longest time it would only be her winter coat which was fine during the winter however now she has broached to say a little denim jacket or an anorak. However these melt downs have now also moved on to her having bare arms. For example I put her in a short sleeved t shirt this morning that was perfect for the weather, my daughter isn’t hugely verbal but will point about what she wants etc. She started crying and searching her drawers for a jumper and only settled when I put one on her. She’s been the same about having shoes on and whilst this has mellowed out she will still have melt downs if she doesn’t have some form of shoe on. I’m worried that whilst the shoes are easily to accommodate long sleeves are not. She’s young enough that she can be affected by the weather and it gets seriously hot here. Can anyone give me some advice if they’ve been in a similar situation and what they did to overcome?

Jackie3178,2021-04-24 11:07:37+00:00,Should he tell his son or not?,"My friend has been divorced for a few years and has custody of his 8 year old son.

Custody wasn’t finalized due to the pandemic so he had to go back to court. Since his ex falsified and, after the lawyer investigated, failed her drug test the first time he suspects she is still using meth. Another test was requested.

She didn’t show up at court so they rescheduled. She then showed up without a drug test and refuses still to take one.

The court said visitation is at the discretion of the father and he doesn’t want to allow his son to visit until she takes a drug test.

Apparently, while previously visiting his mother the son was prepped for this court date by mom. She made it appear the father doesn’t want him to see her when in fact that is not the case. He just wants him to be in a safe environment and not around meth.

You can tell the son is quietly blaming the father for the lack of visitations to his mother.

She has a son 14, will be 15 in two months. He knows how to drive on private land and has been doing so for a while but is obviously not old enough to legally drive or even have a learners. Yesterday while she was at work he took her other car and drove him self to the mall. She got off work early and he was not there when she came home - panic ensued. after calling him- no answer- he came home about an hour later. She exploded, screaming at him about how illegal it was, dangerous ect. He went to his room and locked the door to which she said good - stay in there forever and of course he said he will. He refused dinner last night and she knows she is going to have to actually punish him for it but doesn't know what would be appropriate. He's doing digital learning and not really going out so he's pretty much grounded already.   
Any suggestions? Good reasonable punishments  (And nothing about hitting ect, she does not believe in that )"

Encourage your kids to tell you immediately if one of their friends is thinking of killing themselves, even as a ""joke"" or aren't ""serious.""

Teach your kids that it's better their friends get in trouble for ""no reason"" or even get ""mad"" at them for being a tattle tale then to have one of their friends take their own life. 

If you hear about a kid not doing well take action IMMEDIATELY. Notify the school, the kids parents, or go to the police to ask for a welfare check. 

Yes, you should call, yes you should speak up. Every. Single. Time.

Teach your kid that their bf/gf saying they will kill themselves if they break up needs to be reported to adults right away.

Tell them to speak up if their friends have done questionable things like getting a gun or a stash of pills. 

Be an advocate for the teens in your life beyond your own kids. Keep their friends safe and enlist your kids to keep their eyes peeled for warning signs. 

You are never ever wrong for getting kids help. It's never just a ""joke."""

We will be moving in about 2 months when our daughter will just about be 2 and a half. She has been bed sharing with us since she was born. I know, it's not good but it is what it is now. Anyways my husband would like her in her own room since she will have one now, I would like her in her own room to but personally I love bed sharing with her. I love waking up to her and cuddling her. It's definitely going to be difficult for me but I know it will be for her as well which is my concern. I want to make the transition as smooth as possible. She has never slept without me. She has slept in her crib but would always wake up and want to be with us. We will be in a new house so I don't want to just be like here is your room in this new place now good night! It's not fair to her to do so many changes so I just want to go about this the right way so she does eventually want to sleep in her own bed in her own room and be comfortable. 

Any advice on where to start? Do we still all bed share in our room for awhile or do we sleep in her room with her to get her used to the room then move out?

We're very amicable and her mother is amazing.  


So, to the point of things, since she started school she's becoming more and more different from who she was (she's growing up making friends etc) and I find it hard to relate to her at times, especially as she is not very talkative alsoshe tends to moderate her behaviour depending on who she is with.   
   
What can I do to connect to her more? What would you have needed as a five year old from your dad?"
dbthrowawayrowaway,2021-04-24 05:02:53+00:00,"Objecting to DH screaming insults at DD is ""undermining his parenting""","(This post will be long and have a lot of venting about DH's not-so-great characteristics. Of course, it doesn't tell the whole story of who either of us are.)


DH and I have a three-year-old DD, which is a fun age, but she pushes buttons like any three-nager. It gets to DH worse than it does to me, I think for two reasons: One, I telecommute and have her with me basically all the time, so I have more experience correcting or averting bad behaviour before it starts. Two, he just naturally has a faster temper, especially when he's trying to multitask. That was the situation this evening when he was trying to make dinner (I was working in the other room) and DD had an accident in her pullup (she's almost fully toilet-trained but not quite). He went to change her. Obviously he wanted to change her quickly and get back to making dinner, so he got impatient when she wanted to look at the animals on the pullup first. He kept grabbing the pullup away and trying to force her into it and she was wriggling and trying to grab it back. I could hear him raising his voice at her, until finally he just thundered, ""FINE, HAVE IT YOUR WAY YOU LITTLE BRAT!"" and stormed out the room and slammed the door while she burst into tears. I went into the room, let her look at the pullup for the two seconds that this little game needs, got her in the pullup, and she was just fine and went back to playing with her toys. 


I know this doesn't sound bad in the grand scheme of things, but to add context, this is not at all the first time I've had a problem with the way he talks to DD. He's yelled at her that she's a brat or a little monster more times than I can count. Sometimes she'll be pushing his buttons and he'll cope fine for a few minutes but then (FLIP SWITCH) he starts yelling, ""EVERYONE WILL HATE YOU IF YOU KEEP BEING LIKE THIS!"" Other semi-frequent refrains in the household (especially on Sunday mornings, which is my sleep-in day and when he probably thinks I can't hear him even though he's so loud he would wake up Mars) are things like ""WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?"" 


We argued a while ago over him telling DD that people will hate her, and he's stopped doing that, thankfully. But he definitely doesn't think he's doing anything wrong when he screams at DD that she's a brat. I know this because he literally said those words to me this evening, after her bedtime. He was mad at me because he felt I was ""undermining"" him because, in his words, ""I put her in her room because she was being disobedient and you went in right away to 'rescue' her [with air quotes]."" I said that was not the full story of what happened and that I won't passively ignore him shouting and name-calling her. He said he sees no problem with ""calling her a brat"" (I guess we'll just ignore the angry screaming?) and that it's worse for her to see her parents undermining each other's discipline techniques.


While I generally agree with him that parents should be on the same page for discipline, I told him that when he's screaming insults at a three-year-old, I disagree that I have to feign quiet acceptance and pretend like I'm okay with it. I DON'T want her thinking that this is okay, either as a way to be treated or as a way to treat others. I outright told him I think he models a bad way of being angry. 


Honestly (and I didn't say this because I didn't think of it at the time), if he thinks that going in there and staying calm while solving a problem is ""undermining"" him, that's ... pretty weird, right? Surely undermining would be more like, ""Oh, DD, your silly daddy is screeching at you again! Let's just ignore him while he has his temper tantrum.""


So AITA? We're at an impasse over this, because he really thinks there's nothing wrong with how he talks to DD. I disagree and think that in the long run, she could actually be more harmed by her dad's words (and the implication that I agree with them, by my silence) than by the supposed undermining.


For those who probably think I'm a complete pushover with DD, or I'm falling into some sort of good-cop-bad-cop dynamic, neither is the case. I discipline DD far more than DH does (if for no other reason than I'm home all day with her and can't have a holy terror running around when I'm trying to work, haha). And I'm far from perfect -- I lose my temper and yell sometimes too. But mostly DD is a wonderful, well-behaved kid and we use timeouts when she's not. I've never objected to a timeout that DH has put her in, even if I privately think she wasn't being naughty. We try not to criticize each other in front of her. And (although this post may suggest a different story), I do believe that overall, we parent well together. But this is just a line in the sand for me and I simply don't want anyone screaming insults at DD, even her own dad. 


I guess at the end of the day, my question is simple: Who's right? And slightly more complicated: If neither of us are willing to budge from our positions ... what do?"

My boy is a delight; very active, social, and highly spirited. He does this thing though that's weird,  my mom says she's never seen it before,  and I can't find anything on Google about it. He started a couple months ago and it's become more and more common for him to do this. He will every day without fail choose what we call ""the toy of the day."" It's something small that he can easily hold and carry in one hand, like his self feeding spoon, a little toy animal,  a car, or even a small stuffy. It's different every day but he has some favorites that are chosen more often. Sometimes he will switch toys partway through the day but it's the same thing,  once it's in his hand he just doesn't let go.  No amount of distracting,  playing with other toys,  moving to another location, etc, will make him let go. He holds it while he plays,  reads books, cuddles, he holds it while I put his clothes on, switching it from one hand to the other. He sometimes even insists on holding it while he eats. He falls asleep holding it when he takes a nap and I remove it from his crib, but if I take it before he's asleep he has a melt down.  If I take it away for any reason he will have a melt down. The only way is for him to decide he wants something else more and put it down himself bit I can watch the little gears turn in his head while he decides if he's willing to put it down like it's a really serious decision. Every night we have to go through his bedtime routine,  brushing teeth and putting his sleep sack on, at which point he can't hold it anymore so we have to make a big show of very gently putting the toy ""night night"" and tucking it in and this still occasionally makes him cry.  

It's like he gets something in his hand and that becomes his comfort item but only for that day? Or maybe he intends to play with it later and is just holding onto it until then? Maybe he simply forgets he's holding it, but then why is he so upset if it's removed from him? In any case,  is this something I should be concerned about? He is very strong willed and tests boundaries wherever he finds them- maybe this is just some kind of self empowerment for him? I try not to make a big deal out of it. I never take it away forcefully or hide it from him, because I feel like if he thinks I don't want him to do it then he'll be even more insistent on it. It's not a big deal, just a little weird and nobody I know has ever seen a 1 year old do this so I don't know if it's something I should be concerned about or just a phase that he'll eventually outgrow."

giraffelegs872,2021-04-24 01:35:07+00:00,Daycare Frustration,"Disclaimer: I know that tons of families are still without daycare due to the pandemic, and I super empathize. I recognize that we’re really fortunate that ours has been open most of the pandemic and that we’ve felt comfortable sending our child. 

Our daycare has been closed for nearly four months now due to storm damage. At first, I was super understanding - it wasn’t anyone’s fault and these things take time. 

When the daycare initially closed, they said it would be short term, but that they didn’t know how long, and they offered spots at their “sister” locations. However, we didn’t feel comfortable sending our child there and chose to stay home. 

For awhile, we heard two more weeks. But nearly every update we got was because I requested it (every 2-4 weeks). 

Finally, this last month, we start to receive some updates that they’re going to open. We then went through a series of “we are hoping to open Monday and will give you an update shortly”, followed by silence. I’d email on Thursday or Friday, and receive a “oh yeah, we’re not going to open on Monday, but we’re hopeful for NEXT Monday”. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. 

Last week, they sent out a notice to saying that we’d get information x, y, and z by these specific dates. And then complete silence afterwards. I finally reached out yesterday and received a completely blasé, “Oh yeah, we’re opening on Monday!” (and also saying she’d follow up with more info, which hasn’t happened.) 

Today, we drove by the daycare to peek at the construction...and they were open! Apparently it was a “preview” for the parents that used one of their other locations, but I’m still pretty mad. Not that we weren’t included or that they did a limited opening, but that there wasn’t any communication for the daycare community as a whole. They still haven’t issued any daycare-wide communication that they’re opening Monday with the other details promised to us previously. 

I’m at the point now where I’m really questioning my trust in the daycare’s management and keeping my kid there. 

How do I know if they’re going to properly communicate potential issues in the future? Also, how do I trust that they’re on top of other managerial things when this was handled so poorly? 

I’m interested to hear other parent’s opinions, as I worry I might be overreacting."

Recently, my family and I got diagnosed with gastroenteritis. Our symptoms began to appear about 3 days ago &amp; since my 3 year old, my husband &amp; I seem to have recovered by 80%. We were all perscribed zofran, and all of our vomiting has stopped.

 My 16m old however, she is still having diarrhea &amp; has vomited about 3 times since taking the zofran ( roughly once a day) . She is eating, having a good amount of soiled diapers &amp; has energy to play. I cant help be feel worried for her still. 


Anyone else have experience with gastroenteritis with similar aged toddlers ( mine is 16m old) . 

If so, how long did it last &amp; what was it like?

 Thanks in advance!"

Before this morning I had never even heard of the Snoo sleeper. Then a friend of mine recommended it saying that it is the GOAT of all baby gear and that her child is still a good sleeper because they had one for him.

I looked it up and read rave reviews. I’m a big fan of the Happiest Baby on the Block method and this was developed by the same doctor. Plus it’s (supposedly) the only bassinet ever proven to prevent SIDS.

This evening when I mentioned it to my cousin as a new must-have, she immediately warned me against it. She said that babies who use it have a terrible time sleeping anywhere else. She never used it with her son though so I’m unsure if her feedback is valid, but it does seems to make sense.

I would love to get a consensus from those who have personally used it. It’s a pretty significant investment - we would be renting one but even still, the price tag is hefty. Thanks so much!"

Katalos,2021-04-24 00:39:03+00:00,"Our 7 months old sleeps less than 8 hours, and doesn't take nap. Is she ok?","She started sleeping through the night in her bassinet at around 4 months old, and doesn't nap during day. She sleeps around 9-10 hours in the night and seems to have all the energies in the world, so we were not too worry even a ""normal"" 3 months old should sleep 14-17 hours.

When she overgrew her bassinet at around 5 months old, we got her a proper crib and that's when our nightmare (mostly my wife's) starts. She wakes up every 3 hours for nursing, exactly like when she was 0-3 months old. We thought it might be the crib and she needs some time to get used to it. We don't have a choice anyway because she is too heavy for her old bassinet.

She is now almost 8 months old, still wakes up every 3 hours, sleeps at the same time like us (around 12-1 am), wakes up at around the same time like us (around 9-10 am, sometimes as late as 12 pm), and has a lot of energy during the day. We are getting a little worried because she effectively sleeps less than 8 hours most of the time, which is very far off the ""normal"" 12-16 hours for a 7 month old.

Is she going to be ok sleeping so little? If not, how should we fix it?"

As such, he's been out of daycare and lacking a lot of social interaction. A big part of this problem is that he refuses to wear a mask. He's a very stubborn child, and has probably worn one for a couple of minutes at most before pulling it off. We've tried treats, activities, pointing out other children wearing them, talking about his concerns, but he absolutely refuses.

We're trying to get him back to his daycare (which he loved before he was pulled out a year ago) but the daycare requires masks, and I'm worried one of us will have to quit our jobs to watch him if he can't learn to start wearing one soon.

This has been a hard situation for all of us - is anyone else dealing with stubborn toddlers and masks? we'd appreciate any advice."

Her friend replied no and when I told her she needs to leave the call for dinner she became EXTREMELY apologetic towards her friend and cut the call.

Afterwards when she called her friend back, her friend refused to talk to her and that devastated her.

It’s not just that one friend, it seems in almost every relationship she establishes with her classmates she takes a submissive role where she doesn’t mind being degraded as long as the two of them are “friends”.

This will potentially lead to her being used by others down the road and I’m not sure how I can fix this issue. She’s really optimistic and sees the best in others, I don’t want to take that away."

The first camp I am wondering about is a very special camp. I grew up loving it and I would work there every summer as a counselor and bring my girls when they were too young to camp. We also know the family that knows it very well. They are very excited to be campers. The issue is you have to be at least 8 for the young week. My oldest was finally old enough last year but was taken away because of covid. She was so upset, she packed her bag and we would go through the schedule just like we were there to help her feel better. 

This year covid seems a lot better but is not gone yet.  My two oldest are now able to go be campers and the camp even opened up registration but I'm a little nervous. It is a very small camp ( about 50 campers on a normal year.) But I am still nervous about it. This camp is 5 nights. 

The other camp I wanted to talk about is girl scout camp. These camps are usually just 1-3 nights and are opening up for the summer. These camps let 7 year olds come so ""K"" is thrilled. All of their girl scout friends are talking about going and my daughters are getting so excited.

I don't know what to do I feel like they have sacrificed so much and they have been soo good and understanding  about it. But it is an issue about health. I just feel so torn."

We have 50/50 custody of our 3 year old. In our agreement it states the other parent may call the child on weekdays from 6-8pm. However, he never picks up. I’ve been messaging him to keep track of all the times he declines my calls. 

I’m assuming this would be considered contempt of court - I would have to talk to a lawyer. However it would seem so petty to file contempt of court over not picking up the phone. All it literally is, just 10 mins of us telling each other we love each other and her telling me about her day. He would pick up every now and then but now he doesn’t at all. I guess the advice I’m looking for is would you do it?

A little background, she misses a lot of daycare and I don’t know who he leaves her with or why she misses daycare. He doesn’t keep her on a schedule. He lets her eat whatever she wants and go to sleep whenever she wants. Whenever I try communicating with him he says it is none of my business what he does with her and gets defensive. I guess he’s right in a sense, but I’d like to keep her on a routine especially since I just bought a house and he lives with a bunch of people.

Vanelsia,2021-04-23 23:05:27+00:00,My child's doctor said something disturbing today and I'm thinking of changing doctors.,"We went for a vaccine today and she couldn't stop crying. She's very afraid of doctors in general. We have been going to this one since she was born. At some point the doctor got annoyed by the constant crying and said, with a serious expression, something like 'ah, x is a crybaby. She's going to have a very unhappy life, sensitive people like that are never happy'.

I just realised this doesn't translate well into English, unhappy life sounds trivial, but what she said could also translate to 'lifelong sorrow', 'great misfortune' stuff like that. If someone here knows Greek feel free to ask me what it was and if you want, you can try translating it. 

I just said 'what? Let's hope not!' but the doctor insisted. At that point I felt sick, like a really bad and uncomfortable feeling. But I didn't continue on this. My baby was still crying.

Now I'm thinking of changing doctors. But this one knows her since she was born. She was neutral to nice to us depending on her mood in the past, which is better than most doctors here. And I want to believe that the whole thing was just her trying to joke using black humour. But it unnerved me greatly.

So, what do you think I should do?"

We have 3 problems:

1) my husband works from home in the room beside my son's bedroom. 

2) since he sleep trained my son at 10 months he's the only one who can put him to bed. I'm a SAHM and if I try my son will throw a huge separation anxiety induced tantrum if I walk out of the room after getting him into bed. He won't fall asleep if I'm in the room either.  This is a problem at bedtime too.

3) starting in March naps were turning into hours long hysterical crying fits. My husband was having to go in multiple times to resettle him, and although he was following the sleep training methods we used last year, he thought it was abusive at this age to let him get this upset so husband quit nap duty, declaring son just doesn't nap anymore.

I hate every second of my life being a SAHM now, and this situation is totally unsustainable. I haven't felt this burnt out and stressed since he was a newborn. 

He will nap in the car reliability, but wakes up screaming inconsolably every time and it's dangerous when I'm driving. I also live in a city that's very stressful to drive in, so this isn't a break for me at all.

I've tried imposing quiet time, but it's the same problem, son throws a meltdown if I leave the room and won't rest at all if I'm there. He makes so much noise in his bedroom that my husband can't work or hear phone calls.

CallThatGoing,2021-04-23 20:25:06+00:00,"3-year-old won't calm down, I don't know what to do!","My son will be 3 at the end of the month, and to describe him as a ""high energy""-type would be an understatement. If we don't keep him constantly moving, doing, etc., he will run around like a crazy person all day long. His nap is also the only time that our weekends with him see anything resembling peace, because everything else is like trying to referee a toddler-size X Games (and if he doesn't nap, he's 10x worse -- he seems to find an extra gear of crazy that he'll be on for the entire afternoon). I chalk a lot of this behavior up to him being 3, but he's starting to get written up at daycare for doing things like hitting his teachers, climbing all over other students, and taking off his clothes. He has a particular thing with socks and shoes -- he just \*decides\* that this moment's hill to die on is having to wear them, and freaks out if he can't take them off. The hitting generally only happens when he's already melting down. His climbing on other people is because honestly, he climbs on everything, all the time. 

I try to keep his weekends as structured as his weeks, thinking that if he has something to do, somewhere to go, etc., it will help. And it does, but a lot of the time, it's like trying to decide what tupperware you want to carry your nest of angry bees in. My biggest issue is discipline: time-outs aren't effective unless I literally hold him down in the time-out area, because he'll just climb all over/get into wherever he is, and it's not like we have some empty cell for him. He loses his mind while I restrain him, but then completely forgets about it as soon as he's done with the time-out, and goes back to whatever he was doing before to earn a time-out in the first place. I grew up in a very heavy corporal punishment kind of house -- my mom would hit me with kitchen implements, tools, sticks, etc. I refuse to do that to my own kid, but I don't have a great model for disincentivizing his crazy behavior. 

I was told to try to incentivize good behavior, but to be honest, he just doesn't seem to be able to not be a crazy-high-energy-wall-bouncer all the time. He has tiny little periods where he can play quietly by himself, but they're rare islands in a sea of climbing/running/knocking stuff down/pulling out every toy/etc. He gets tired, but it doesn't slow him down, it just gets him strung out and acting worse, so I can't tucker him out at all -- if anything, I have to work on conserving his energy!

I'm at my wit's end. Am I supposed to just ride this out? I feel like a bad parent for not ""doing"" something, but when I think about how my parents stopped me from doing stuff (hitting the shit out of me), I don't have a solution that works. Help!"

My big issue is his inability to regulate his behavior, mostly at home. Today he and his brother were fighting over a damn pencil and his brother pulled at his shirt and hair. He responded by stabbing his brother in the head with the pencil. This is a new level of violence for him. The wound was pretty bad and bled a lot.
For corrective actions we take away his beyblades and tablet when he acts up at home. He doesn't care. We tried rewarding him for good behavior at school but that didn't motivate him either. 
Is this behavior something that speaking with a counselor would help? Is this just because of his age and he'll mature and grow out of it?
I'm scared he's going to do something violent at school or if he's on a play date.

I know, he’s a toddler and we’re gonna have meltdowns but if I can do something simple to reduce stress I’m all for it. So, I’d love to find a uniform for him, something soft and lightweight I can buy in multiples to replace our jumble and get us through the summer. Help! 

I checked Primary but they’ve nothing long sleeved at the moment, and I’m in Canada if that makes a difference. TIA!"

1SpyseeChikn,2021-04-23 19:36:26+00:00,Other parent confiscated phones I pay for,"Maybe I should have posted this in r/custody but it’s kinda toxic over there. Basically, I bought my daughters phones, and pay the bill, over a year ago. They live with their dad and I’d like having as little communication with him as possible. However, because he’s toxic and childish, he keeps creating scenarios where I would HAVE to contact him. 

The reason I initially chose not to talk to him  and bought the phones in the first place is because he was constantly disrespecting me and my husband. For years he didn’t even have my phone number and was forced to contact me via email which made him think twice about the messages he sent. 

For the past year while my daughters have had their phones, every few days/weeks, they’d be in trouble for the smallest things and he’d take their phones for a long time. For example, if they were still up at 8:31 on a school night and their bedtime is 8:30, he’d take the phones for two weeks. Always looking for reasons to take the phones from them. 

Well my oldest daughter is 11 and she now has a gf. I’ve talked to her about this (both liking girls and having a gf/bf) and though I don’t like it because I think she’s too young to date, I don’t think it warrants a punishment. He however, not only took her phone but her sister’s as well and said he was going to send them back to me. I had to find this out through my youngest sneaking to talk to me on Facebook kids. I hadn’t heard from them in two weeks at that point and still don’t have the phones. 

I’m so tired of going through this. My daughters are tired of going through this. On one hand, yes I am refusing to talk to them through him because I know his ego will be happy about it and I hate that. More importantly though, he took the phones without telling me and I’m still paying the phone bill on them. He is one of the most disrespectful humans it is my misfortune to know personally. I REALLY don’t want to call to speak to my daughters just for him to mention his wife for no reason (I also remarried), ask if I’m still unemployed (I’m a stay at home mom and chose my own hours), or be condescending in any other way. If I don’t want to talk to him first, he makes up some reason why I can’t talk to my daughters. 

Just please. If anyone has any sound advice, I’m all ears. I’m tired. Just so tired."
CapableSoul,2021-04-23 19:28:56+00:00,I’m struggling,"I’ve just had my second child; a daughter 8 weeks ago and I’m finding it so difficult. I also have a 2 and a half year old boy who luckily does go to nursery a couple times a week. I think you just really forget how hard the baby stage can be once your first gets older and easier. It’s hit me like a ton of bricks! My husband is a great dad when he’s home. But he’s gone most of the week at work. 

I’m pretty certain she has colic, since she’s okay through the day then it hits the evening and she just screams till she’s off for the night, so that doesn’t help things (my son never had colic) Although I’m so grateful and happy to have two beautiful healthy children, I’m just finding it hard while she’s so young and just screams. 

I’m not really sure what the point to this post is. When I try to talk to my family I just get the usual “it was your choice to have 2 kids so close together” which it was, but I did want to have my children close in age and then focus on  my career when they’re in education. I guess I’m just hoping for some advice and some positive words to get me through"
Dutchmile,2021-04-23 19:28:53+00:00,Do your kids like Disney movies?,"Maybe my priorities a little out of whack, and maybe I’ve thinking too much about this. My wife and I have been going back and forth about saving for future vacations and where we want to go. One of those places is Disney World. Neither of us have ever been, so I only really know as much about Disney World as my research and testimonies from my cousins have told me. 

The thing is, if I make a bunch of big plans and spend that much money for a Disney Vacation, I want it to be a treasured experience for my daughter and and future kids my wife and I have.(this vacation would still be years off, by the way). I feel like the best way for that to happen is if the kids are big fans of Disney.

So my question is, are your kids into Disney movies? If so, what age did they become interested. Right now my daughter really only likes Baby Shark vids and (apparently) Jack Hartman. She doesn’t really respond to Disney movies."
gamingkate,2021-04-23 19:24:38+00:00,Any advice how to teach 11 month old more independency in falling asleep?,"My soon to be toddler (still can’t believe it’s happening so fast!) is still very much set in her ways when it comes to falling asleep. What I mean by that is - she won’t fall asleep unless I’m rocking her in my arms walking around the house. 
If I sit down she immediately starts screaming and nothing other methods seems to work. It has to be rocking in arms and standing up. Sometimes when she’s completely drained she’ll fall asleep if I lay down next to her but that’s only happened a hand full of times since she was born. 
We co-sleep and I’d like to continue that for a while but I’m looking for ways I can slowly start getting her used to more independency in falling asleep.
Almost one year of carrying her for every single nap and nighttime sleep and my back is begging me to find an alternative.

He says it to his friends all the time and it bothers me. What does this mean? Should I be worried?"
Byebyeguy,2021-04-23 18:36:26+00:00,Helping 10 year old with friends," I have a 10 year old son that is a great, great kid. He’s kind, smart, and funny. From his teacher’s perspective, he gets along with everyone and they’ve never noted any kind of social issues. However we’ve noticed that he hasn’t developed any strong friendships in school. He goes in, he gets his work done, and then he comes home. Last year he had a few good friends that were in his class and I know he hung around with them a lot in school and we had all of them over various times, but it’s only been reciprocated here and there. I think part of that is because the kids are getting to the age where they are taking a more hands off approach to setting that kind of thing up. 

I think my son doesn’t really make a huge effort because he lacks confidence a little and does have a little anxiety.  If a neighbor comes over, he wants his older brother to stay out with them. Once he gets comfortable, there are no issues. 

Not really sure if I should do something or just leave it be. He’s happy at home, loves being here, and genuinely seems happy overall.  I think he is the type of kid that wants very close friends and that’s proven to be a little bit of a challenge. He seems to have an easy time being acquaintances with a lot of kids, but not many close friends. Occasionally he’ll say something that makes me think that he’d like to change that. Any ideas?"
Viperbunny,2021-04-23 18:21:34+00:00,Can the teachers stop giving my kids suggestions on how to spend their time?,"I know they mean well, but I am losing my damned mind. I have two kids doing remote learning. They are in different grades a year apart. They have school from 9 to 12:45. Then, they have meetings, specials and homework. I am a stay at home mom and I knew all my time would go into school. But I don't have anything left! Each special is at least a half hour. Every assignment is about a half hour. The little one has 4 specials, 2 social studies, and two science a week. My older daughter has that and two math assignments. On top of that, they have reading logs and math programs they are expected to log into. They have maybe an hour or hour and a half of meetings a week and about 10 frigging hours of homework.

Then, they have the nerve to tell the kids it is a nice day and they should go outside! How? I would love to go outside, but by this time it is almost 1PM. I have to get both kids lunch. I have to do the chores I couldn't do while they were doing work, because moving around is too distracting to the kids and the teachers send out reminders that the work space needs to be quiet. The kids eat lunch and then we try to get the work done by dinner time. We need to do at least two assignments a day. Sometimes, we get a lovely surprise, like a bigger project. Oh, and gym lessons are great. It was wonderful to have my kids doing donkey kicks in the living room! That totally is the type of destructive behavior I want them to learn to do all over the living room and totally didn't freak the cats out. The one time they assigned a nature walk it was too cold and rainy to go out! And with what time? I have two kids. I am one person. I have to sit with them to make sure they get their homework done. I have to help them and they always need help at the same time and have to wait. It can take time to go back and forth because it is less homework and more me teaching them the lesson. With only one of me, I can only go so fast. My husband does art with them, and takes any assignment that is art heavy because it is so stressful.

These projects require so frigging much that despite all the Amazon orders, I run out of boxes! It was lovely to have to spent two hours building cardboard robots and 3D room maps without any notice! It is lovely when the assignment requires two people! I can't do all the gym crap. I am a fat woman who has had health problems. I am getting healthier, but all these assignments rely heavily on high impact activities. I can ride a bike, walk, do low impact stuff. I can't be jumping and stomping around. I am already doing the homework and specials with them, now, I have to set up a game that I have to create the pieces for, all for five minutes worth of work.

&amp;#x200B;

And I have to do it ALL. I have parental stalkers who are looking for any way to insert themselves. If the kids fall behind in work, we will get in trouble. And that can give them a chance to say the kids need the extra support. They aren't supportive. They are abusive terrorist, but that doesn't matter in my state. They don't have legal standing now, but it is pretty easy to cause a situation where they can get it. Which is why my kids can't go in the yard without me! These stalkers can show up at any time, and with the weather getting nice that is far more likely. They aren't allowed on my property, but the police have declined to do anything to  help.

I am exhausted, emotionally and physically. I am sick of having to argue with my kids because they have to do their work first. If I take them outside they won't come in and get anything done. I wish I could reverse it, but it never works. I have tried it many times. I have no time to work on the things I need to do. I have no way to do chores because the kids need a completely quiet classroom and they are already unhappy that my kids do their work in the same room (I am one person, they are in the dining room and have their own desks). 

Today, the teacher did a lunch brunch so they could socialize. That is great, until she suggests they do it outside! I have another kid I am helping with. I can't be in two places at once. If I knew that was the plan, I would have set it up. But her computer is already no working and so I would have to try setting up my husband's computer (which is a pain in the ass) up while making lunch for everyone else! I didn't have the time or the ability. I had already been denying myself a trip to the bathroom because I was so busy. We plan to go out in a little bit, but that particular moment was a really bad idea. But as soon as it was suggested the mom guilt and fights started. It isn't fair.

I don't have anything left. My husband does take the kids after work, but it is a drop in the bucket. There is no way to get a break because if I need a drink or food or anything, I am the one to do it. I will get pulled into conversations. Even if I get a few minutes to myself my kids are so loud that I can't stand it. I grew up in abuse. The constant loud noises wear on my nerves. I am in therapy. I am on medication. I got my first round of the vaccine so I can do more. But I can't change that this is pandemic life. Even if I get a break it isn't enough to build up the stamina. I am trying to do all this while trying to find ways to protect us against our stalkers, who have been relentless for three years. I am so tired. I am so low. I have no way to get what I need. I feel like everyone is taking and taking and taking. I don't know what to do anymore."
nomad_9988,2021-04-23 18:11:58+00:00,Would you consider this abusive?,"A family member gifted my 3.5 year old about 1000 dum dum lollipops. We have been using them as treats for good behavior as we have had some problems with her behavior. 

The problem comes when she really really wants one right now. She will ask repeatedly over and over. I counted once, and she asked me over 40 times in the space of me trying cook dinner. So I had the brilliant idea to throw one away every time she repeats her question. We haven’t gone past 2 thrown out before she gets the message.  For the sake of my sanity, I needed this.  However, I told the family member who gifted the lollipops, and she says that this is emotional abuse. 

I had no idea until it was brought up. I can see both sides of this argument. I’m just hoping other parents can weigh in with their opinions."

averageredditcuck,2021-04-23 17:56:02+00:00,Should I cut off my father once he's done paying for my college?," 

Here's a quick rundown of my loving father

· He Yelled a lot

· I cried a lot

· He’d yell at me for crying

· He’d yell at me for saying he was yelling

· This led to me crying at the first sign of confrontation for the first 13ish years of my life

· Didn’t trust me, I remember him asking if I was lying a lot

· He’d drive really fast and take sharp turns when he was mad at us

· I remember at least once where my brother and him were arguing in what’s now my room and then there was banging and my brother screaming. My brother might’ve been being dramatic, but still

· The most useful thing he ever taught me was how to get the last bit of toothpaste out of a roll of toothpaste. He showed me how to change oil on a car once, but jiffylube does that for free

· In general, never instilled any values or lessons in me

· Didn’t spend any time with me

· I mean we went fishing a couple times, we played poker when I was little, he was the assistant coach on my soccer team for like half a season, but he stopped cause his ego got in the way when I called him the assistant coach because he didn’t know as much about soccer as the head coach and the head coach had been the coach for the past several years, so he was kinda the assistant coach

· I listen to podcasts where the host has a new person on every show and the first thing he does is pretty much ask questions through their life story and I always hear about how large of a part their father played in their life. This figure that encouraged them and taught them and loved them and I don’t think I ever had that

· Went drinking on my brother’s birthday instead of hanging out with him. My brother is a shut in, family is all that he has and it was his fucking birth day

· When I was in the hospital for a head injury he told me not to let it happen again because it was costing him a lot of money

· Made fun of the way I talked during the recovery

· I feel like I recall him saying he was ashamed to be my father and in general just lots of awful things to say to a child

**· Abusive in all ways but physical, supportive in no ways but financial, but that just means you could replace him with a large enough check**

· So he was a piece of shit for most of my childhood, he was a piece of shit to me during the hardest year of my life(concussion recovery+quarantine.) What else could I possibly need him for? Not only has he not been a good father to me, but if he couldn’t do it at either of those times, I don’t think he’s capable of being a good father

· He’s failed me as a father

I want to call attention to the, abusive in all ways but physical, supportive in no ways but financial. I think the way I'll get back at him is when I'm done with college in 6 months, I'll stop talking to him. He does pay for my college which he'd hang over my head if I ever brought up his parenting (he always did that as a kid, ""I put a roof over your head, blah blah blah) but since I don't really get anything else out of the relationship, I don't see what I'll need him for once I'm done with school. Whatever inheritance I would've gotten would be worth less than getting to tell him that he's an awful person and he's an even worse father and that I abhor him. If he bitches about it, I'll tell him it was a piss poor investment on his part to put that much money into someone he treats like garbage. So what do you guys think, AITA?

tl;dr My dad is borderline abusive and I'm considering cutting him off once he's done paying for my college, the one bit of leverage and support I receive from him"

Bought said book and seemingly it captured my little guys attention far longer than the stories featured in the 'Little People Big Dreams' series of books which I had also bought at the same time.  

This obviously got me to start thinking...

WHERE CAN I BUY OTHER 'KID MADE' PRODUCTS?

Hence I'm hoping to ask this same question to the wider forum here.

Equally as I haven't found a regularly updated list or website where such products are featured I started to collect these stories on my own Instagram account 'aninspiredchild' under the thread 'Daring Dreamers'.  

During the early years at a time when these minds are so impressionable perhaps what can be most inspiring is seeing other young people Dream Daringly (is my thought).  And hence it is with this in mind that I've started to feature young makers and other risk takers following their dreams (firstly to inspire my little guy and hopefully now for the benefit of others).  

As such, would love to hear of other 'kid made' products you recommend (both because I'm interested to buy and also to feature!) 🙏♥️🌞 Thank you."

Ginger_ish,2021-04-23 17:27:31+00:00,How do you talk to a 4yo about death?,"My almost-4yo has been asking about death recently, and I'm just looking for tips on the best ways to respond. I know it's developmentally normal for kids around this age to start talking/thinking about death, but I've been caught flat-footed looking for a good response to her questions. 

Fortunately, she's only asking about it in relation to characters dying in movies, not as a result of a death in our family. I've been caught a bit off guard the couple of times she asked, so I've been vague (""Elsa's parents' ship got caught in a storm and sank"" and then ask her something else to distract her) or focused on people dying from old age (Moana's grandma), but she's clearly trying to understand how it works on real life because yesterday she asked if her great-grandma is going to die, and then asked if she herself is going to die one day (oof, that one hit me hard). 

I want to be matter-of-fact and straightforward, but not traumatize her with implications she's too young to emotionally handle. We're not religious--I'm an athiest, my husband is agnostic, though our families are Christian--so I don't want to rely on ""heaven"" or other religious-based stuff as a comforting explanation. I'm open to telling her that lots of people have different ideas about what happens when we die (I'm not hostile to religion and will be fine with her exploring and choosing what she believes as she gets older). 

Any resources, best practices, or scripts that have worked for you?

Thanks!"

She also likes fruits. However, meats are give and take and vegetables are rare for her. She will eat corn and sometimes green beans on a blue moon. 

I've tried finding vitamins that she will like but so far nothing. She likes these gummy vitamins that I got but they didn't contain any iron, so I got iron gummies and they literally taste like sugary blood so that was a no go. Got a liquid vitamin that I can mix into her drinks and she doesn't like that- she will give me the full drink and say, ""ew more"". I've resorted to toddler milk powder that contains vitamins (and iron) but I'm not really a big fan of the fact that the second ingredient is corn syrup solids. 

I'm an unhealthy person myself- I'm overweight and have a poor diet (have ever since I was little- think unlimited little Debbie's and mountain dew). Id like for her to have a different lifestyle than I and I try to feed her healthy things. She is a good weight and height so it's not that. I'm just worried about the nutrients.

Active-Sheepherder-5,2021-04-23 16:03:17+00:00,My son has terrible friends,"My son (8) gets along with everyone and truly is a nice boy. I’m not just saying that because I’m biased either, other parents constantly tell me what a good kid he is. Problem is, the boys he chooses to become really good friends with are just awful. So bad, in fact, that the school is placing my son in a different class from two of them because they’re always either fighting or involving him into their trouble (he only gets in trouble when he’s with them).

I’m not one to dictate who he can and can’t be friends with, but one for sure I just “don’t have his mom’s number,” which will only work for so long. The other one lives next door and comes over all the time. I really really dislike that kid and I tell him my son can't play whenever I can get away with it. Nobody but me ever watches him or monitors his creepy behavior, he constantly lies, hits my dogs and last year I banned him from coming over until he proved to me that he would stop showing his penis to other kids. His parents don’t speak English and won’t come to the door when I knock, so I can’t really tell them about his behavior at my house. So my son is not allowed to play at his house at all, which makes me feel like a controlling jerk. Before anyone jumps to conclusions, the only one of my son's best friends that I genuinely do like also has parents who don’t speak English and I trust them 100%.

My husband isn't worried about this at all, he doesn't seem to care. His excuse is that his friends were always horrible too and he turned out ok. This is not comforting to me because my husband spent most of his teen years on drugs and all his former friends either OD'd or ended up in jail shortly after high school. 

Point is, I try to instill good morals in my son so he can have the tools to not get dragged into their messes and surround himself with good, trustworthy people.  I’m legitimately worried about this pattern in his life, choosing dreadful friends and not telling them to take a hike when they do bad things. What do I do? Just keep doing what I’m doing and hope he grows out of it? I don’t think he will, he’s always been attracted to the worst kid in the room and his cousins are pretty terrible too.

Now all of a sudden, daycare tells us there are multiple cases of the stomach flu going around the entire school, staff, children, parents. Is there any point to picking them up early again in the hopes of them avoiding the bug? Or do we just need to accept that they will probably get sick and just get prepared at this point?

My husband was at the appointment and doesn't ask many questions and sometimes doesn't relay the best info back, but essentially we were told to seek out a Pediatric Opthalmologist. We're going to CHOP, and they said my son will need to see a neuro ophthalmologist bc it's the optic nerve.

On Wednesday I googled an inflamed optic nerve (wrong thing to do, I know) and I'm getting back returns about MS and so now I'm freaking out.

Can anyone ease my mind? I wasn't ever able to have any more than my son and now there's this little part of me that's always terrified I'm going to lose him and I saw MS and I've been extremely stressed out ever since. We have an appointment at the end of May and I need to have something logical to hold on to for when my mind wanders to the darkness.

Thanks in advanced, I hope this is the right place for this."

kduluth,2021-04-23 14:32:40+00:00,Identical twin girls diagnosed with idiopathic short stature,"I have twin girls who are 12 years old and are about 4’6”.  

We had a well child appointment this week and the doctor expressed a concern about their height since they have started puberty recently but have had no growth spurts - just staying on a slow and steady path. 

She did a bone age test (results are consistent with chronological age) and wants them to see a pediatric endocrinologist to see what options we have.  

Any experience in this?   She’s predicting their height to be 5’ at the most.  I am 5’7” and my husband is 6’ and they have an older 13 year old sister who is currently about 5’4”.   They were born 11 weeks premature and never caught up to their peers.

wickerocker,2021-04-23 13:30:49+00:00,3-year-old only wants physical affection when his sister is getting it,"Not really sure what to do here, if anything. Our 3-year-old (4 in a couple months) is very sweet, but has reached that age where he pushes us away when we go to kiss him while saying “yuck!” and that sort of thing. I know this is totally normal and sometimes I can sneak some snuggles in when he is sleepy.

Well, we also have a 1-year-old daughter who is still very snuggly, plus we breastfeed 2-3 times a day still. So besides just the random cuddles all throughout the day, she also gets some set snuggle sessions as well.

Now, as expected, there is some jealousy between my two kids and I feel like we handle it pretty well. The only thing that I am struggling with is that my son will have zero interest in getting any attention from me *UNTIL* he sees or hears me giving affection to my daughter. Then he races over while making a loud, attention-grabbing noise and tries to forcibly shove his way in between us. He will say things like, “Mama I want a hug!” or “Mama be a horse!” or whatever. And I think I should point out that he isn’t being sweet or snuggly when he does these things. Instead he scrambles up on the couch and then leaps onto my back with his arms wrapped around my neck to the point that it throws me off balance. Or I may be holding up my daughter while she stands and my son will shove his way between us to the point that I can’t hold her up.

I used to be more passive and conversational with my responses (like, “Sweetie, you’ll hurt your sister, please stop,”) and trying to gently stop him until my son was just flat-out fighting me one day and made me spill hot coffee everywhere. So, now I am immediately firm to the point of yelling. As soon as he starts to come towards us and I can see in his eyes what he is doing I just hold up my hand and firmly, loudly, say “No.” Now he sees this as a challenge to try harder. At this point I have to basically stand up, grab my daughter, and leave the room for my son to stop sometimes (not all the time, but enough to be a problem). I’ve had to choose which child to catch before because I was trying to hold on to my daughter and my son was just being absolutely wild while I kept saying “Stop it right now!” 

Now, I should note that almost two years ago my son broke his arm in this kind of a situation and nothing has changed in his attitude despite us trying lots of things. The situation was that my husband was playing with our son and some other kids that were taking turns jumping into my husband’s arms and my son did not wait and ended up falling and landing on his arm. I know he wasn’t mentally capable at the time of really understanding the idea of taking turns and so we have worked A LOT on safety, waiting your turn, etc. At the playground he is an absolute gem and won’t do anything he feels unsafe doing! But at home, all bets are off. I mean, I get it. At the playground he has other kids to play with and isn’t counting on me for attention or fun.

I set aside time every day for us to spend one-on-one and we do some preschool homeschool stuff. I feel confident that my son is getting A LOT of attention and definitely getting my undivided attention every day. My husband and I (we take turns) read books before nap and bedtime every night with just him and we offer physical affection many, many times during the day. I am a SAHM and my husband works from home most days, and even then he is usually not locked up in the office. 

It’s becoming infuriating, to be honest. I know he is little and this is normal and all that, but I’m not being the mom I want to be because I am having to yell at him to get off of me before we all get hurt and then coming back ten minutes later to say, “Ok now we can do a piggy back ride” only to have him say, “Nah...I don’t want one anymore.” So yeah, I’m just jaded now after over a year of this and getting to where I can feel myself tense up when my son comes towards me while I have my daughter because 9/10 times he is coming over to battle for my attention for the 127th time today. 🤦‍♀️ 

Help.

Tl;Dr: my 3-year-old son rejects attention and affection until he sees/hears me loving on his 1-year-old sister, at which point he comes running so that he can try to forcibly prevent me from giving his sister attention and give it to him instead. I am tired."
jocelynpenelope,2021-04-23 13:24:01+00:00,Meals taking FOREVER,"Ok I know this is a totally normal thing for her developmental age, but my 4-year old daughter takes FOREVER to eat a meal and it’s driving me INSANE. She will easily take 45 minutes to eat a simple breakfast in the mornings, and will still be sitting at the dinner table for over an hour after everyone else has finished their meal. We loosely follow the Satter method of feeding in that I truly don’t care how much she eats, so if she says she’s done or her tummy’s full, regardless of how much she’s eaten, then that’s ok with us- so it’s not like I’m forcing her to sit there until her plate is clean (although we do have the house rule that she must try at least 1 bite of every item on her plate). But I have to constantly remind her to sit in her chair, to eat her food, is she done eating? No? THEN EAT YOUR FOOD. Seeing her brother finish his meal and get to go play doesn’t phase her or speed her up at all. If I left her to her own devices, she’d probably take 3 hours to eat a meal and that’s just not conducive to life when we have to get to work/school/daycare in the mornings, and have to get through bathtime/bedtime after dinner. 

So what do I do here? Any advice would be appreciated!"

I've asked several people about it and I have gotten mixed opinions, but a few people have commented that they worry he isn't getting enough supervision at daycare. He has also been bit a handful of times in the past few months there as well.

He doesn't bite at home, so it is hard to really correct the behavior since we aren't seeing it happen. 

In general, I love his daycare. He is excited at drop off and pick up and the communication has be great (due to Covid rules I don't actually see any interaction in the daycare room - just drop him off at the door).

So, any advice? Reassurance that it doesn't make me an awful parent to have a kid who bites? Thoughts if we should start looking into a new child care situation?"
6christian,2021-04-23 12:37:53+00:00,Is this disrespectful?,"Hey Everyone,

Just a random question. For some background, my wife's family is Russian and her mom speaks perfect english. 

My wife's mom has expressed multiple times that she thinks our 10 month old son should learn Russian, and we have both told her we are not interested in teaching him Russian. My wife learned Russian before english and had to do ESL classes in school to learn how to speak English correctly.

Whenever we bring our son over to my wife's mom's house or she speaks with him over the phone, she will speak in Russian to him.

To me I think that if we told her that we don't want to teach him Russian and she speaks perfect english, there is no reason for her to speak to him in Russian.

Does this make sense or am I being ridicolous?

TIA!"

She is fine with friends or people she knows but will often hide or need to warm up even to people she does know. We feel this is especially important since she will be starting Kindergarten in the fall in a whole new school and with a new group of children.

This is especially true in group activities like dance and soccer. She often breaks down and will clamp on to us like we were trying to throw her into an active volcano. We've tried all sorts of things (including some things we probably shouldn't have) to get her to join the group but she still fights it.

kinghippo79,2021-04-23 11:22:27+00:00,"3 yo won’t sleep through the night, is my approach bad?","My 3 yo has been waking up and throwing tantrums and whining. I try to calm her but nothing works; sometimes she says “go away!” or “stop talking to me!” or leaves the bed and throws her self around the floor and the chair in her room. 

When she tells me to go away I tell her ok, I’ll be right outside when you need me and she’ll yell “no! don’t leave” or when she says stop talking I say ok, let me know when you want to use your words to tell me what’s wrong and then she’ll yell “nooo, I want to talk” but then proceeds to start the tantrum cycle all over again when I’m listening. 

The only thing I found that works sometimes is if I tell her, if you keep this up then we’re not going to the park tomorrow or we’re not going to the playground on Friday. I only use this when she’s throwing herself around the room and tantruming hard.. at this point I’m pretty much at my limit with patients and running on little to no sleep. 

Tldr; 3yo wake up tantruming/whining, after trying calming techniques only thing that works is telling her no playground the next day if she doesn’t stop.

My question is: is it bad to punish this behavior by taking stuff away?"

Iwanttosleep8hours,2021-04-23 09:20:20+00:00,My neighbours are harassing because of my kids,"I need to vent to people who will understand what it is like with young children so forgive me for the long post. 

Back story: I live in an apartment which I have owned for 7 years, we moved abroad for a couple of years but moved back due to covid affecting my husbands business and I needed to get a job. While we were living abroad we rented it to a nice family with two kids however part way into their tenancy they requested to leave due to the people living downstairs harassing them because their kids were making noise. Then covid hit so we didn’t manage to rent it out and eventually decided we needed to move back.

Anyway, the first few months were fine. My husband is often away abroad so it is just me and the kids. One afternoon we got a long letter through our door telling us to stop making so much noise. Obviously I am not going to say we are quiet because we have kids. So I went downstairs to apologise, try to understand what noise was bothering them, understand what times they are home etc. As soon as the door was answered I got a mountain of abuse calling me a bad mother, telling me I have to move, saying my kids are out of control, how I need to take the kids out the whole day (we were in lockdown at the time), and how I was so inconsiderate. It was an awful exchange and I just stood there kinda shocked.

My daughter is just a toddler so she will make noise like she cries a lot but I can’t really help that. They are in childcare from 8-6 anyway and are always in bed by 7:30 so it is not as if they are up all hours. My neighbours also play drill music all the time really loudly both during the day and at night, often waking up my daughter from her nap. I know the noise they are talking about because above us is also a family and I hear the noise they make but that is the cost of living in a flat. I know the reason they are targeting me is because I am a woman with kids which makes me vulnerable. There is another person in my block who plays music insanely loud with his windows open late at night on weekends and there has never been an attack on him.

After that I they started doing weird stuff, they have their granddad over often and if we are outside while he is he will stand there and stare, it is really unsettling. My husband said hello to him the other day and he stopped, turned around, and said in the most creepy voice “why hello there”.  Anytime we walk past them they are so hostile and they have made it so ridiculously unpleasant living here.

Which brings me onto today. I left to go pick up my son from school and caught the woman gossiping about me to my other neighbour. I just ignored them and went about my day but I was pretty upset why someone has basically made us their enemies when they don’t know us. 

Anyway, after I put the kids to bed I was cleaning up after dinner. I have an exterior fire door and an interior door which is the entrance of my flat and I heard someone open the exterior door. I forgot to lock the door since I was dragging in two exhausted children, two bags, two water bottles into my flat and I heard the interior door start to open. I immediately went to the door when they heard me and immediately opened the exterior door and literally ran down the stairs and back into their flat. I didn't manage to open the door fast enough to see who it was but I heard their door slam so it was obviously their flat. I think the speed which they ran into their flat alarms me the most because obviously they were planning something bad.

After the initial shock I wanted to cry, I am on my own with two kids and I felt so unsafe. I have no idea what they are doing or what they had planned. I also have no proof it was them and it wasn’t like them came inside so I feel like even if I did get the police involved there is nothing they would be able to do and it will just make it so much worse. I ordered a camera with motion sensor which I will install today so at least if they do it again I will have proof."

sttaylor07,2021-04-23 08:32:53+00:00,"Febrile Seizure - Not Looking for Advice, just Solidarity I guess","My daughter turned one last week and had her 12 month vaccines. One of these was the MMRV, and I was told she could spike a fever 7-10 days later. Well last night at 1:30 am, she woke up screaming and sure enough, she had a fever. We gave her Tylenol and put her back to bed. All through the next day, we monitored, gave Tylenol as needed, and gave her fluids. Tried to make her day as normal as possible. 

Tonight, we put her to bed at 7:00 and she was asleep pretty quick. I went to take a bath around 8:30 I think to unwind from the day. At 9:45, I was done, and was getting up to shower. I checked her on the monitor, she was fine, and I decided to do a quick shower and then go check her temp. I closed the shower curtain, started the shower, and as I was waiting for it to warm up, I peeked out a the monitor again and my baby was seizing. I’ve never moved so fast in my life, and I honestly don’t know how I didn’t fall on the slippery floor. I bolted to her room, dripping wet, and rolled her onto her side and waited. Fortunately, I’ve read up on febrile seizures before so I knew what to do. However, it was the most terrifying moment of my life and I stood there watching my baby seize, not knowing if she was about to die. She was making strange noises, and I didn’t have my phone near me to get my husband who was in the basement, way too far away to hear me. 

She probably only seized for about 20 seconds, but it felt so much longer. I picked her up when I was sure she was done, and she was completely limp, but conscious and breathing. We ended up going to the hospital, got told we were right and it was a febrile seizure, and to just keep an eye on her. 

Now it’s 2:30 am and I’m watching her sleep on the monitor and my stomach just drops every time she moves because I’m so afraid of another seizure. I know the odds, and I know she probably won’t have another one within 24 hours,  but that she could very well have another one in her life. I’m so scared that she’d have one while we are sleeping and choke. 

Basically, I’m terrified now, and I don’t know what to do. So I’m looking for solidarity or something...just someone to help me feel better. 

TL;DR my baby had her first febrile seizure tonight and now I’m too scared to sleep and stop watching her. Help me feel better?"

Then recently, at age 8, he's been putting toys in his mouth such as rubber/silicone bracelets. The other day I found him with some small plastic toy parts in his mouth and scolded him because they were definitely choking hazards.

I could almost understand if he never outgrew the toys in mouth habit since childhood, but he stopped at age 3 and only restarted recently at age 8. He's even asked for a pacifier.

Is this something to be concerned about? Should I really get him a pacifier? Or maybe a mouthguard instead? I'm not sure if I should get him to stop putting things in his mouth, or give him safer non-choking alternatives."

averageredditcuck,2021-04-23 07:46:03+00:00,Here's a list of bullet points i'm bringing to therapy about my abusive father,"  here's what not to do i guess

· Yelled a lot

· I cried a lot

· He’d yell at me for crying

· He’d yell at me for saying I was yelling

· Didn’t trust me, I remember him asking if I was lying a lot

· He’d drive really fast and take sharp turns when he was mad at us

· I remember at least once where Nicolas and him were arguing in what’s now my room and then there was banging and Nicolas screaming. Nicolas might’ve been being dramatic, but still

· The most useful thing he ever taught me was how to get the last bit of toothpaste out of a roll of toothpaste. He showed me how to change oil on a car once, but jiffylube does that for free

· In general, never instilled any values or lessons in me

· Didn’t spend any time with me

· I mean we went fishing a couple times, we played poker when I was little, he was the assistant coach on my soccer team for like half a season, but he stopped cause his ego got in the way when I called him the assistant coach because he didn’t know as much about soccer as coach bob and coach bob had been the coach for the past several years, so he was kinda the assistant coach

· I listen to podcasts where the host has a new person on every show and the first thing he does is pretty much ask questions through their life story and I always hear about how large of a part their father played in their life. This figure that encouraged them and taught them and loved them and I don’t think I ever had that

· Went drinking on Nicolas’ birthday. Nicolas is a shut in, family is all that he has and it was his fucking birth day

· When I was in the hospital he told me not to let it happen again because it was costing him a lot of money

· Made fun of the way I talked

· I feel like I recall him saying he was ashamed to be my father and in general just lots of awful things to say to a child

· Abusive in all ways but physical, supportive in no ways but financial, but that just means you could replace him with a large enough check

· So he was a piece of shit for most of my childhood, he was a piece of shit to me during the hardest year of my life. What else could I possibly need him for? Not only has he not been a good father to me, but if he couldn’t do it at either of those times, I don’t think he’s capable of being a good father

· He’s failed me as a father"
OmniAeternalis_97,2021-04-23 06:55:55+00:00,A question for parents from a teenager,"I honestly don’t need to be thinking about this, I’m 15. I do wonder if I even want children though, and I know that sometimes I feel this deep longing to devote myself completely to a child, and to raise a kid in a healthy home. Often times I imagine myself in a situation as an adult where my kid does something stupid or makes a mess or gets scared and I’m able to work through the issue in a calm, quiet manner that makes that kid smile and feel supported rather than feel threatened. Does that sound egotistical? I say all this because I’m worried that adopting a child to raise, even with a husband who I hope will be there, will require I give up some measure of my individuality. I have hobbies and passions I care about, some require money and all require time. I suppose I will know I’m ready to spare parts of myself when I feel a child is something (someone) who I would give up everything for. Is that how I will know? Am I thinking selfishly? I wonder if I could be happy like that, or even with the responsibility of a life. Just tell me your thoughts on all that. I know I don’t even need to think about it, but it crosses my mind from time to time and there’s no harm in having a conversation."

avgfem,2021-04-23 05:24:36+00:00,I think my 18 month old is ready for potty training.........HELP ME PLS,"I want to preface this by saying that I am a certified ECE teacher that has NEVER had to deal with potty training so I am clueless and nervous lol.

So my 18 month old son has been showing some signs (that I googled) of being ready for potty training like hiding when he poops, keeping dry diapers for a lot longer (they really only become soiled when he naps cause he doesn’t have control at that point), ripping his diaper off if it is dirty, and wanting to follow myself or his dad to the bathroom.

I’m kind of lost on how to move forward with this. I’ve bought a toilet for him to start practice using. He’s smaller than the average 18mo (like 5th percentile) so trying to put him on the actual toilet seems dangerous since he would fall right through if he doesn’t hold himself up. He’s somewhat interested in his toilet though. I’ve gotten him to sit on it when I’m in the bathroom. And I’ve tried a couple times with getting him to use the bathroom in it but he won’t. He has clear tell-tale signs of when he needs to use the bathroom so that’s when I say “hey, let’s go use the toilet” and I sit him on it but nothing.

What tips and tricks do you have for potty training? What worked for you and what didn’t? I know all kids are different but I’d love to hear others experiences of potty training, especially with a child who is ready for it at a younger stage in their toddler years."

GambinosDisciple,2021-04-23 04:19:44+00:00,Loss of attitude towards sport,"Covid has hit my kid hard. He gained weight, and has become overly invested in videogames. Ive been handling it well, something that has really helped has been the inclusion of screen time limits for videogames and what not.

My kid is pretty talented at soccer. Currently plays in one of the if not the best academy for his age. He was never a regular starter, but he had an important role in the team before lock down. Lock down came, and thus took soccer for some time. He started integrating himself again for about 2 months now. Not a bit of talent was lost, but a whole lot of attitude was gone. 

I assume this has been because of his other growing interest in videogames, he just dosen't prioritize sport as he use to, and their is nothing wrong with that, if he wants to quit so be it, but he tells me he still likes soccer, hes just being mediocre.

Anyways, this lack of attitude has taken a toll on him and set him back to playing with kids of a lower level, and in all honesty, it sadens me to see his potential go to waste.

So, I come here for advice... How can I encourage him to put in the extra work? Should I advice him to talk to his coach? Should I talk with his coach? What do I say?"
rikkilynn23,2021-04-23 03:51:46+00:00,"Daughter found an adult toy, how do I approach this?!","Today we messed up... I was having a bad headache and my SO asked my daughter to go grab the bottle of Tylenol on top of his bedside table. Normally our daughter (9) is forbidden from our room, so she decided to take the opportunity to look in my SO’s bedside table. My daughter is obsessed with pink, so of course the first thing she notices is the bright pink adult toy hidden in the bedside table. When we later went to bed it was just laying in the middle of our floor. 

My SO went to ask her if she had gone through our table and she responded that she did, and that she just wanted to look at the “pink thing” because it looked interesting.. he just reminded her not to go through his things and left it at that. 

My question now is how do we handle this. It’s very obviously phallic shaped, and she knows that boys have different shaped genitalia, so she must be confused. Do I just leave it or should we come up with an explanation? Though my daughter knows basic biology and about certain aspects of reproduction. I’ve never gone far enough to explain sex and I don’t feel she’s old enough or mature enough yet. She’s a very whimsical child and still believes in fairies and magic. I have no idea how to approach this if I should approach it at all. Anyone have any advice or similar experience?"

If I could, I would have her live in a world where people aren’t so corrupt and evil. She doesn’t deserve all the negativity and heartbreak that lies ahead of her. I wish people weren’t so cold hearted and indifferent. It hurts me to know that one day she will feel the sting of rejection and disapproval from others. I just wish I could keep her away from all that. 

However, I know that wouldn’t true be life. We can’t truly appreciate the good without the bad. I just don’t want her to hurt. Ever. Because in my eyes, she doesn’t deserve it. Honestly, no child does. As parents, all we can do is be there for them when they do see the world for how it really is. Wishing we could go back to when they saw the world as a beautiful and happy place."

She rarely calls only if she wants something. She never even contacts he brother or sister. She is addicted to her phone. When she lived at home if we took it off her at night she would be violent attack at us. She quit uni. She hangs out with negative people. She always plays the victim mentality.  She recently told me her friend is a prostitute but swear mum im not..i dont believe her she lies now.  I feel so sad. I never thought she would grow to be this personality. She was a beautiful child. It makes me so depressed.
slychikenfry15,2021-04-23 03:23:34+00:00,Non-stop talker/ ADHD,"I have a lovely 5yr old boy who since the age of 2.5 has NEVER stopped talking.  He will talk to anyone about anything. 
He recently started TBall and I've noticed during practice he constantly makes comments to the coach, some are borderline rude. We correct him each time and even tried making games out of seeing how long he can go without having to ""have the last word"". I know it can be very annoying to deal with a kid that doesn't know how to be quiet and try to gently encourage better behavior but on the other hand I don't want to make him feel insecure or like he isn't likeable.
On another note at his mid term kindergarten teacher meeting she mentioned that he has trouble sitting still and while it was still early we should watch for ADHD.
Other than his non-stop talking and extra energy he is a pretty normal kid. He makes friends with everyone, follows rules, is no more impulsive than any 5yr old, and seems pretty on par for emotion control.
Has anyone had experience with this and their kid was not ADHD? Any tips or advice for curbing his talking?"

We're straight up omnivores in our household. But I see nothing wrong with people eating whatever healthy diet that they choose, whether it be for moral/health/religious reasons. I'm not eating it! Why should I care? To go along with it, there's a strong anti-vegetarian sentiment in their (my MIL/FIL's) household, despite the fact that my SIL is vegetarian. So every holiday gathering (remember when those were a thing?) we are subjected to comments about the tofurky or how ""that stuffing wasn't cooked in the turkey, that's the yucky one"". My own sister is vegan and was vegetarian before that for over 20 years. I've seen the shit she's had to put up with because she feels that this diet is right for her. It's just so fucked up.

thelizzyparable,2021-04-23 02:33:31+00:00,So frustrated with my mom!,"My daughter will be 4 on May 10th. She is very prone to Strep throat and also has obstructive sleep apnea. She had a sleep study done back in February, and she's stopping breathing a lot in her sleep and her oxygen is staying around 93-94 while she sleeps. 
She's been on the wait list to have a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy at the children's hospital in the city. My mom knew this and was going to be our babysitter for our 5 year old. She said she would set aside the time off to keep our son for the 2 days that our daughter is in the hospital. The hospital called today and scheduled her surgery for April 28th, next Wednesday. I called my mom and she says she can't keep my son. That she doesn't have the days. She told me I couldn't be mad or frustrated at her, and she blamed it on leaving work early 2 weeks ago when my house got robbed. While I was thankful she watched the kids that day, we didn't ask her to. She showed up at our house after my dad called her without even talking to me. 

This surgery has been on the table for months now and she is all I have to rely on. My husband and I don't go on dates, hardly ever do we not have our kids, and I just really needed her. My husband is talking about not coming to the surgery so he can stay home with our son, but that's not fair to our daughter. Also, my sister, her husband, and their 5 month old baby are flying in from across the country on May 18th and my mom has already taken off days to be with them even though she just flew up in January to see the baby. It's just really frustrating. My whole life, my mom has picked my siblings over me. Something else has always been more important, and now history is repeating itself with my kids. 

Sorry if this seems whiney, just really irritated."
Zealousideal-Field74,2021-04-23 01:49:02+00:00,Party Question,"I realize this is a silly trivial question but I was hoping to get some input from more experienced parents. 

I haven’t been to many kids parties. We’re having a birthday for my 4 yr old at a playground and expecting 15-20 kids and their parents. There will also be some family / friends there without kids. 

The playground location should be entertaining enough but we’re also considering hiring someone to do games/activities with the kids (good idea? Necessary?) The entertainer requires a 1 hr minimum.  If we do hire him, the party start time is 11 so we would have him from 11:30-12:30 and then serve lunch at 12:30. Do you think it’s too late to make people wait an hour and a half from the 11am start time to the 12:30 lunch time? Too long of a wait for food for the guests?

Again I know this is trivial but like everyone else I’ve been in hibernation for the past year and apparently forgot what’s appropriate at a party."

I'm married and she's married and we split custody. I get my child on weekends. The kids identifies as gay and non-binary. 

Anyways, my kid has been cutting and never attempted suicide that we know of but has told the therapist that he has a plan for how to do it. After a week in a psychiatric ward that he was very receptive to and volunteered to go, everything was great. Normal kid stuff. 

They stayed with mom after their time in psych, then I went and got them and we had a great weekend. I took them to the mall and give them a 50 to do whatever with.  

We went to hot topic and I was thinking we were there for the cool pop culture stuff because their clothes suck but they have neat Harry Potter and anime stuff or whatever. My kid bought a skirt. Like a black schoolgirl skirt with a chain on it. And I texted mom and told her and she's like NO! and I'm like idk dude we're already at the register paying I'm just giving you a heads up. 

Then he bought a bucket hat. Like... I can't make sense of where his mind is. Idk. Idc. 

Fast forward, I come home from work the next day and they're walking around the house in an outfit built around the skirt, I tell them we're going to a party, they get changed into sweats and we head out. Super fun night, super fun weekend.

On the hour long drive to mom I tell them, mom isn't ready to see you in a skirt and honestly I'm not either. They nod and that's that. 24 hours later he's readmitted to the psych ward because that started cutting and planning to hang themselves. Because mom said she isn't ready.

I’m so grateful for my husband’s job, especially throughout covid. 

But I feel like being a SAHM, according to my husband, means that the majority of the childcare and household responsibilities, including things like paying bills, scheduling appointments, planning and buying birthday gifts, all of that falls to me.  My husband is a “fun” dad, so he needs just as much directions as my kids do sometimes. 

The major point of contention right now is after work childcare. He is frustrated with me because he has to watch the kids in the evening while I run errands, he sees it like I’m just going shopping for fun. We don’t take the kids anywhere unnecessarily because of covid, so I don’t take them during the day. Plus, grocery shopping with small kids is the *worst*. 

Other stay at home parents, how do you all divide childcare and household responsibilities?"
RedDeadJunkie,2021-04-23 00:34:46+00:00,My 14 month old daughter seems to like daycare more than at home. Any advice?," 

Background here: My 14 month old daughter seems to hate my wife and I since she started to go to daycare about 3 weeks ago. She goes Monday-Friday from about 9-4:30/5 She loves it when we bring her there but as soon as she is at home before or after daycare she is extremely unhappy. My wife and I have tried everything but she gets unhappy as soon as we do anything with her.

Try to feed her, she will refuse to go in her chair for awhile and then won’t eat until we leave her alone.

Go on the ground in her play area/room, she throws herself on the ground and cries all over us

Put her down for a nap, she wakes up as mad as she was before

Take her on walks, she will be complacent for awhile but eventually will cry

Give her snacks and drink: she just throws it on the ground or slaps it away

The only thing that makes her happy is holding and waking around with her for hours on end.

The daycare is fantastic, they have cameras there and we see her having a blast. They take constant pictures and they constantly tell us how “wonderful and how surprising it is that she adjusted so well”

That’s awesome and I’m so happy she loves it at daycare and learning and all but my wife and I are at wits end and we do not know what to do anymore.

Any tips? We would love any tips"

On Easter Sunday, my wife, my two boys (2 and 5), and I went over to the in laws for Easter dinner.  Everything went well.  When we got home we received a call from my father in law that my mother in law had a slight fever.  Come to find out that my mother in law had been having minor symptoms since the prior Thursday but did not let us know nor had she had the vaccine despite being eligible for a few months.  We asked her to take a covid test which came back positive. My family went into quarantine mode for the next ten days and my wife and I got tested every 2-3 days. My brother in law and father in law tested positive 3 days later.  I tested positive on day 10.  This triggered 10 days off of work for me.  My wife began showing symptoms about 5 days later and tested positive. I will have to go back to work soon and my kids will not be done with their quarantines by the time I have to go back.  I asked my mother in law if she would be able to help with the kids while I am gone but she has said that she is far too busy.  She has a part time job as a tennis pro and does not actually need to work to support her household. My wife will now need to take vacation to stay home with the kids.  

Am I wrong for being pretty upset about this?  I know we shouldn't have been seeing family until we were fully vaccinated but I think some of the fault is hers.  How should I handle this situation? How can we express our feelings without making the situation worse? Thanks."

I see so many women complain about how they have to do all of the child care, house chores, cooking and some even also work. Even good men who are committed still don’t do the bulk of the work. 

Why ladies, why choose this route? I will never understand why any woman would want this for herself.

Currently it’s that when she pulls herself to stand or tries to take steps she tries to walk on her top toes or even almost on the tops of her feet with her toes curled under. And I remind myself everyday I do not need to call the doctor to get into early therapies yet, this is normal in toddlers learning to walk and that I can bring it up at her appointment in a month if I’m concerned.

He also does not have safari or any browser on his phone. (Not that he can’t get to a browser otherwise, ie screen time sucks and you can open safari through gmail app). He also uses a laptop for homework, to voice chat on discord and will sometimes be allowed to play Minecraft after his homework is done.

He knows she does, but seems to make excuses that he is scared he will fail resulting in a divorce like his parents did.  I find this a huge cop out.

jeldim,2021-04-22 22:26:08+00:00,Timing daycare start w/ COVID shots,"So, I'm the mom of a 2 year old and after 13 months of keeping her at home while I WFH, I'm finally sending her back to daycare part time (so I'll have 3 kid-free work days and workdays with her home with me, which feels like a good balance for me). During the work week she would be in daycare Monday-Wednesday and home Thursday-Friday. The plan was for her to start May 3.

Anyways, next Monday (April 26) I have my 2nd Pfizer shot scheduled for myself and Tuesday (April 27) my husband is getting his 2nd Pfizer shot. I had originally planned on starting my daughter in daycare the following week (Monday, May 3) but was told by the daycare director that she could start as early as Monday, April 26.

So, for those who have had the 2nd Pfizer shot: if you were in my shoes would you start her a week earlier than planned so someone else could watch her while you rest off the shot? I was already planning to use my PTO if it hit me really hard, but hadn't considered that it might help to outsource childcare if I'm feeling profoundly crappy even if I'm not working."

VigoPhoto,2021-04-22 22:00:25+00:00,It's been a day (and it isn't even bedtime yet),"I get that pandemic life is hard for everyone and I try to be sensitive to that, but these children broke me today.

I have 4 kids between the ages of 8 years and 8 months. We have been yo-yoing between in person learning and distance/online learning as the province's restrictions have changed over the school year. My oldest child is diagnosed with ADHD, and I am beginning to suspect my second child of having ADHD as well which adds to the challenge. For the last few weeks I have tried to be patient and understanding with my kids about how they are feeling and acting out (small humans with big feelings), but today it was just too much.

The two older ones have been fighting with each other constantly, because well...they only have each other right now, so why not fight to the death all day every day. The toddler (2.5) is working on his last set of molars still so he is a small demon who refuses to sleep and doesn't know his own strength. The baby is well a baby, and 8 months old. 

The 8 year old stopped paying attention and disappeared during the morning lesson which led to him having no idea what was going on during the afternoon lesson and didn't say anything until after the lessons were done for the day. The 6 year old was flat out rude to both her teachers and myself this morning during her morning class. They then woke the baby three times while I was trying to get her down for nap. I finally get the baby and the toddler down for nap and the older two are trying to hurt each other. I snapped and told them to sit in opposite ends of the couch in silence and think about their behaviour and the effect that it has on others. 

The oldest seems to have responded, not sure about the 6 year old. And hubby picked up takeout for dinner so I could have a minute.

Tldr: kids and pandemic schooling drove me crazy. Made the kids sit in silence and reflect. Hubby tried to soothe me with takeout."

The hubby went out to get some work done today and I took out the laptop and somehow ended up on a ""I regret having kids parenting,"" reddit which I now regret. I definitely love my children already but a lot of the posts were about how difficult the first year with babies is  and I guess me and my husband knew that on some level but you can't really know what it's like until it's actually happening. I've just been worried about how to maintain the love in our relationship. Maybe we both need to have a talk about making sure the kids come first for the first year and just fully brace ourselves for that?

It causes me distress every day. It is my main reason for my depression. I have additional deep rooted trauma from it, because I had skin bridges which ate a common side effect from circumcision. I had to get them fixed at 13, and recovery was traumatic for an additional uncessary surgery. I am happy I can still have sex and orgasm, but I have bad scarring on the head of my penis.

I am currently in therapy, and am restoring my foreskin using devices, to bring back some of the lost sensation and pleasure, and so I can look uncircumcised.

I have a few questions:

How would you handle this if your child told you this?
Would you pay for his therapy?
Would you pay for his foreskin restoration devices?
How would you like your child to approach you about this subject?

I love my parents, but I really resent them for this. It's hard because they were great, but it makes me sick they mutilated my genitals without my consent. It is my main reason of trauma.

My mum came over today and while we were hanging out, the older kids wanted a snack so I grabbed them each a plate of breadsticks, veggies and a spoonful of hummus. 2 of these were served on small side plates and one was served on a plastic peppa pig plate (this plate belongs to one of the younger ones). I literally used this plate because that is what I had to hand.

My mum was horrified to see my 11 year old eating off of this plate. In her words I was ""not respecting him and infantilising him"". All of my kids were saying it is not an issue. My mum carried on saying that they're not babies and I shouldn't treat them like babies. She said she never would have given me that plate at 11 years old.

The thing is, she had 2 kids (me and my sister.) Who were of similar ages and had similar interests. She didnt have 5 kids with such a huge age gap. Also, I'm not going to throw put all of the baby plates when the kids get too old for them anyway. A plate is a plate and there is no need to make an issue of it. 

She told my kids that I was disrespecting them. She told them that if I did something like that again that they should call her. I feel like I am going crazy. I dont get the issue. I dont get why she ruined such a lovely afternoon. I dont think I will ever serve something on that plate again without getting angry. I'm honestly at such a loss."

Both of them sleep well at night. They go down around 7PM and can stretch until around 4AM - and with a little coaching stretch another couple hours until 6AM.

During the day though, I’m going nuts. Their schedule is basically 6AM, 9AM, 11AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM and 630PM. They eat for about 30 minutes, play for another 30-60 minutes, and then take a nap of about 30-45 minutes. Sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less.

Is this normal? They tend to take around 5oz with each feed, although rarely 4oz and sometimes more like 6-7oz. They’re gaining weight and growing just fine - maybe that is most important - but the schedule is hard to keep up with.

When he is afraid he is in trouble, or is being told to do something he doesn't want to do, he gets into these fits where sometimes he'll cry and sometimes he'll just whine, but he makes this specific whine/grunt sound over and over and over and he can't (or won't) shake himself out of it. At home, we try to be silly or do anything we can to break him out of the rut, but at school, with 12 other friends in the class, the teacher has him sit out in a cozy corner or sends him to hang out at the front because he won't cut it out.

Today I called school because I saw he wasn't in his classroom and the teacher said he just ""keeps making that sound."" I was able to talk to him on the phone which snapped him out of it and he went back to join his class no problem. 

Things to note, the last time I posted here, he was getting angry, yelling, and not sleeping in his bed, so we had him drop his nap at school and that was working really well until recently. Now he's not yelling anymore, but he's getting in these grumpy loops with the whining. The only thing that has changed recently is that he learned he's going to be a big brother. We did not intend to tell him so early, as it's only first trimester, but he's seen me get sick quite a few times and we wanted to assure him it wasn't coronavirus and he wasn't going to get sick and die (and ughh, how much I hate what the pandemic has done to our kids :()

TK-11530,2021-04-22 16:07:11+00:00,Teaching Daughter Not To Blab,"I've been divorced and separated for over a year and a half at this point. My ex (F38) and I had a little girl (6) but separated after my now ex-wife simply gave up on the relationship. She didn't want to work on the marriage, go to counseling, or talk about her problems in the relationship; it just ended and she blamed me but never said why. After realizing that she wasn't going to work on the relationship I was quick to put the marriage behind me, I moved forward with the divorce, parenting plan, hell I even had to help her find an apartment!

I was blessed to meet someone who I gelled with rather quickly after this whole process. In fact she's been my ride or die through COVID and a lot of the legal and interpersonal battles that follow a divorce. Ex has been high conflict and passive aggressive since the beginning. One of the more insidious things she does is using the child as a conduit for information.

My partner and I were suspicious of how my ex gets information after Ex shared the fact that Partner's mom had failed a COVID test. We had only told my daughter, and since there was no close contact it simply wasn't an issue -- till Ex made it an issue by informing my daughter's preschool. She told the school, the school filed paperwork banning my daughter from preschool for two weeks immediately. By the time I heard about it and called they said it was too late we'd have to wait for the quarantine to end. I don't blame the school for following their policies strictly, I do blame Ex for not only extracting information from my child but also weaponizing it.

Last month I moved in with Partner. There was a brief interaction where Ex, from the door way, says ""this is a very nice house, how'd you find it?"". I gave a generic answer, telling her ""you know realtors, friends, family. The usual sources."" This answer must not have been satisfactory, because I caught Ex directly asking my child how I bought a new house and where I found it. She was asking on the way out and the Ring doorbell overheard the conversation.

This has lead to my partner being very mistrustful of information she shares with and around my child. For example, we're planning a trip later in this summer as we're both vaccinated. Neither of us want to keep it a secret, but my partner doesn't want my child to know because she doesn't want Ex to know we're going to be away from home for a prolonged period. This has lead to some resentment, with my partner stating ""it's like I'm living with a little spy."" I worry she blames my daughter for being used by her mom.

How do I teach my six year old not to share information about what happens at my house unless it's important information to share? I don't want her to not be able to talk about things like abuse or dangerous environments at either parent's house, or that it's okay to keep secrets, but I my partner has an expectations that Ex won't know every detail that goes on in the house."

She's in a private kindergarten class with 15 other kids and in a bad week she has 1-2 tantrums a day that involve hiding under a table or laying on the ground crying. It usually involves another kid violating some internal rule she's decided about whatever they're playing. It's never the same kid and even when I hear her side of it I can tell it's not ever malicious on the other kids part so it's not a bullying issue or anything.

Her teacher is great about trying to engage with her and help, but she also doesn't have time to sit with her on the ground and calm her down, especially when she retreats and refuses to talk. Mainly, she just feels things *very* strongly and when she's overwhelmed with anger and frustration she just can't control her body or the tears.

I think factors that are making it worse involve: 

* being in the same class as her sister (they get along very well but they can also push each other's buttons).
* the class is made up of a lot of kids that have gone to preschool together and they've all kind of adopted roles and while she has lots of friends, there's also lots of internal cliques and I think sometimes her role has become the ""dramatic one"" and other kids expect it from her which becomes a cycle.
* She wants more learning time and less play time and free choice time where the kids make the rules. She absolutely loves the structured learning times but it's a play-based educational curriculum and school and they give lots of opportunities for self directed play.

All of these factors should improve at public school next year. She will be in a class separate from her sister, the class size is bigger but with more structure and learning time sitting in desks, and after school care will be shift in the kids and involve a new environment. But until then I'm really at a loss. She's never violent or destructive so I don't have concerns about her getting kicked out or being too problematic for mainstream learning, but she alienates her friends with the tantrums and it's hard on her and on everyone around her.

Any strategies are greatly appreciated!"
ittyBritty13,2021-04-22 15:42:54+00:00,3 year old struggling with gymnastics class,"I have enrolled my 3 year old into a gymnastics class. He has now been to three of the classes and each one has been a wildly different experience.  
  
First class was an obvious struggle with the new environment, new people, etc. I had to stay close but he slowly worked up the courage to play and participate.  
Second class he took some warming up. Took 10 mins to talk him into joining his friends and I had to stay close by again. The last 15 mins of class I was actually able to leave the room and go sit and watch from the outside.  
Class three was a giant step backwards with almost zero participation. No interest in doing much of anything. We even left 15 mins early.  
  
Is 3 years old too young for a structured type course like this? It is a one hour class once a week.  
  
He is always so excited for class. Comes right home to get on his little outfit, rushes me out the door, eagerly waits at the classroom door asking every few mins if it's time for class. But then when the door opens, he just freezes. Tells me he's shy, tells me he doesn't want to go in, tells me he wants to go home. The teachers are maybe 18 years old so they only do so much and that's ok but I'm just at a loss of what to do.  
  
If I stay, I'm the only one actively trying to get him to participate, if I leave and he asks for me they send him right out to look for me. He is also a cry until he pukes kind of kid and I would really like to avoid that so leaving the teachers to deal with any potential meltdown is not something I am comfortable doing. I knew this was going to be an adjustment for him but I'm not sure how much I should push this and stick with it or what other options I have to try and make the excitement in the class match the excitement leading up to it. Any advice would be great because I am at an absolute loss"
CapybaraAdrift,2021-04-22 15:42:08+00:00,"I don't want to be that parent, but I think my teen is playing up for attention.","So first things first.  I am queer, and divorced from my kid's dad (hetero marriage).  My kid came out as bi when they were 11yo, and has evolved their identity to know use a more masculine name than the one I gave them at birth, and to now prefer they/them or more recently he/him pronouns.  The identify as genderqueer, and still dress largely femme.

Now.  I have no issues with their gender-related exploration and identity.  I use their preferred name and pronouns 90% of the time. (I still slip on occasion, it's a relatively recent development.)

They have a very tightknit group of friends, most of them are kids they've been friends with for years.  I think all of them are AFAB, but slowly each has been adopting a new name and new pronouns, and it's hard not to think that there's some peer-pressure/clout type thing going on.  13-14 is a weird age for any kid, wanting to both fit in and also to be special.  I don't want to be someone who dismisses self expression and discovery as trying to fit in, and I have no plans to stop them.  I just let them know I support them no matter how their identity changes and develops.

But then on TOP of this....

They have been seeing a therapist for around a year.  They had some depression and anxiety, and since it runs in my family (I myself have also sought therapy and am currently on escitalopram, have been since my child was born) I had no issues with making sure they had someone to talk to, especially when there was a brief period of time where they said they were considering self harm.

Currently things are getting worse.  They are failing almost all of their classes, have zero focus or concentration, and when confronted they breakdown about how stressful their life is, how anxious they are and things like that.  Last Saturday we had a brief family outing to pick up food and they didn't want to get out of the car (too busy on their phone) and told me their anxiety was bad and they couldn't leave the car.  There was a brief battle of wills, which they won.  And shot eye-daggers at me for half an hour after.

Also at a family gathering with a little extended family (all within our covid bubble) they started exhibiting verbal/physical tics.  When I asked them about it (in private) they told me that ""it just happens sometimes, it's not tourettes, it's no big deal"" and then I've never seen it happen again.

I feel like it's fairly obvious that yes, they have some depression and some anxiety, but that they are playing it up for attention and drama.  But how do I deal with this without becoming the big bad parent who doesn't get it?  If we try we get shrieks of ""you don't care about my mental health, I feel like you don't love me"" and I just am at a loss.  Is it time for a different therapist, maybe a family therapist?  Do we just cut off all of their internet and phone?  That seems harsh given that this is the primary way they get any socialization these days. But I know that the devices are a large part of what is hurting their school work and next year they start high school (if they are not held back this year).  

My ex and I are on good terms but we're both at our wits end on how to handle this kid.  I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or just to vent.  If you got this far, thanks for reading."
supportle55,2021-04-22 15:39:09+00:00,How do I say no? Or should I say yes?,"My son is six and has been hanging out with his friend once a week at our house and once a week at his house since school started.

They take my son's best friend (their grandson) often. 

I guess I'm just hesitant because they are strangers to me and my son. He would be just with the grandparents and his friend.

The other night my 8 (almost 9) year old daughter told my wife that she thinks she is fat. She said she looks bigger then all the other girls in her class and that some of her clothes fit too tight.

My wife had a talk with her about body image and health and comparing to other kids, etc, but what I’m seeking from you all is some ways in which I (her dad) could help support her without giving her a complex about her weight. 

I grew up with just me and my brother and we never talked about body image or anything like that and neither did my parents. My wife is great at the one on one conversations with her and supporting her, I just don’t want to say the wrong things or give her the wrong idea about herself.

Idk I feel like I’m charting new waters here and I don’t want my wife to feel like she has to handle this on her own.

Has anyone gone through something like this with their little ones? What helped? What should be avoided?

Anyways my daughter is 6 and has made friends with them all. Usually she gets home and we do homework and eat dinner(we eat dinner early at 4pm usually done by 4:30pm). Afterwards she goes out and plays with all the kids(they stay outside and play in the yards). I make her come in around 5:15-5:45pm so she can get a shower and we can spend some time together before bed(usually playing a board game or doing a puzzle) or she goes to gymnastics(this is 2 nights a week 5:30pm-7pm). I put her to bed around 7:30pm. Anyways she is starting to her upset because all her friends are out until 7/8pm playing and I make her come in. Should I let her stay up later? She usually will fall asleep at 8/8:30pm and will read in her room until tired. She gets up at 7am just fine most mornings. Also I do enjoy our time together at night but I know at some point she will want friend time over hanging with mom. Also on weekends I do let her stay out until a bit later if she wants but typically she will go out around 11am and come home around 4pm and want to stay in because she’s tired so it’s not a issue as much. Anyways what do you do?

We usually do so great in his virtual school I'm able to get him to focus and behave well because I use positive reinforcement and reward his good behavior. But he has now spent the last few days spitting in my face, hitting my face, throwing things at my head, and not listening at all in class. The problem is that I'm at a point that he is throwing things at my head and he likes to watch me get scared or upset when I say no and he keeps throwing things at my face/head.

She got in trouble for sneaking scissors but, like, what else do I say. She looks wild but she seems quite pleased with her hair being out of her face and wants to keep this hair do.

I offered to get it cut short but she wants the mix of long and short. It looks like I neglect my child it's so bad. 

What the fuck do I do here?

Algernon96,2021-04-22 12:48:16+00:00,Husband can’t handle when kiddo (7) is happy,"My husband (39) has a hard time when my son (7) gets hyper. And my son gets hyper when he’s in a good mood. So how it goes down is that my son wakes up in a great mood, talks his head off happily to me, tells me all about the new movie he’s made up or whatever, and then he so much as hops near his dad, and he gets barked at. “Can’t you just calm down?!” “You’re going a mile a minute!” 

Already my husband has basically agreed to be sidelined from the hard parenting because he loses his temper, gets vindictive and then he and the kiddo just escalate each other. Since I suggested husband stop taking part in discipline, the kiddo’s difficult behavior has completely taken a 180. He’d have angry tantrums before and his teacher complained about him. Since the husband stepped back, I kid you not, every behavioral issue we had melted away. The teacher is praising his turnaround. Husband even acknowledges, yes, he’s been so much better since I haven’t been making things worse. 

So I’m getting frustrated. I don’t have a partner for the tough moments and when the kid is happy, he complains he’s too hyper. So I’m feeling like I don’t have a partner at all. For about an hour at night, they play video games together. That’s pretty much their only healthy interaction. 

Is this normal? Aren’t 7yo kids hyper on the whole? If he’s well behaved, why should I tell him to calm down (as my husband keeps insisting I do)? Do other people get angry when their kid is happy/excited?"
kid_with_the_nose,2021-04-22 12:43:45+00:00,My son got slapped over a rude joke - thoughts?,"My son is 12 years old. He’s a sweet, adorable, goofy kid who charms the pants off anyone he meets. He's well-liked amongst his friends and he's always been a ""class-clown"" type. He does get into trouble sometimes, but he usually apologizes really quickly and takes his punishments on the chin.

The other day, he came home with a bright pink mark on his cheek. I got pretty concerned and asked him what had happened, but he just said he'd crashed into a doorway. He was acting a little fidgety and I pressed him further, but he didn't change his story. I gave him some ice to put on the wound and he seemed to be doing better later.
However, later I was talking to his older brother and apparently he saw what really happened.
So my son and his friends were hanging out at a nearby park, as they often do. Apparently, my son made a rude, sarcastic joke towards one of the other boys, regarding his father who left the family and is no longer in the picture. The boy promptly came up and slapped my son across the face. It must have been very, very, hard; as it left a bright red mark on my son’s cheeks and bruising which has lasted for a few days.

My older son also said, to be fair, that my younger son got teary-eyed and apologized profusely as soon as the other kid hit him. I think I should clarify that they've been friends in the past, and my older son said the kid ultimately accepted my son's apology, and that the two of them ended up laughing over it.

 My son’s a witty, sarcastic kid, always having some smart quip to chime in. I believe that he thought he was just messing around, but probably went too far.

My son told us the truth, though he seemed really embarrassed and ashamed by it. My husband told him that it’s no worse than he deserved for making a comment like that.

I believe my son needs to be respectful, but that violence isn’t the answer. The boy in question is a lot bigger and stronger than my son, who’s always been rather scrawny and sensitive.

Is there anything I should be doing about this?"

I tried turning her in her bassinet and she continues to favor that one side.  The past two nights every time I woke up I would turn her head. She pretty much always turns it back after some time.

It was around 8:00PM and the five-year-old had had a busy day with school and was very cranky.

She has a habit of not wiping because she “doesn’t know how.” She went to the bathroom and came back and was obviously still wet. My ex-wife sternly told her to wipe and she didn’t want to. Eventually she got disrespectful and rude and lost her TV period. My ex-wife sent her to her room.

From there she was still disrespectful and mad and would poke herself out from time to time only to be ordered back in. She would not get a snack like her sister until she finished.

All this happened on FaceTime, so I asked my ex-wife to let me talk to her. My older daughter was given the phone and asked to give it to her sister.

She took it to her. When I started talking, I was trying to comfort her. I told her that she can feel frustrated but she should think about that when it happens so she doesn’t be mean to her mommy. We talked about why she’s frustrated (having to wipe, no TV or snack). I told her she was frustrated but was being nice to me, and if that she explained her emotions to her mommy she could help her. 

After some convincing she decided to talk to her mommy with my help. She took me to her mom with her. I said, “I feel...” and she said “frustrated.” I said, “I also feel...” and she said “frustrated?” Lol. It was cute. I was trying to get her to say sorry and when I told her that, she said sorry. Her mom asked what she was sorry for and she said “nothing.” Sigh. I reminded her that we had talked about her being mean and then she answered that. My ex-wife was calm and glad and discussed how she felt as well. They went and got the snack and my daughter was back in control of herself.

Did I step on my ex-wife’s toes? I stepped in because I hate seeing my daughters make decisions that get them into progressively worse trouble when their emotions take over. Could I have helped in a different way? Or just let go and worry about things on only my weekends?"

kznas,2021-04-22 10:58:02+00:00,Do we owe our parents because they gave birth to us?,"I m from South East Asian Buddhist background. My parents and I both migrated to Australia 9 years ago.
 In my culture we are brought up to think parents should be respected as much as Gods. 
We are always told that kids should always listen to their parents, we should always respect them and always put them before.

In both culture &amp; religious teachings, children owe their parents so much for giving them birth and bringing them up to adulthood. 

This is a debt children can never repay. And we are always taught to take care of our parents. This leaves a huge financial burden on a lot of burmese children as it is an expectation for adults to financially support their parents. 

Now I am struggling so much as I see things differently as I grew up in western culture. 
I moved out of home, finished my degree, work and bought a house like normal adult person. I never used drugs, stayed out of trouble and I am trying my best to have a decent life. 

But this isn't enough. My dad especially thinks I have gone astray. He would tell me his friends have good children and we have gown up in  away he disapprove of. His disappointment is so hurtful because all the bad things I have done is some minor trouble I have caused as a teenager (I used to not pick up their calls sometimes when I am outside because they cause me so much anxiety), going out to meet with friends, a date or traveling (but they see it as being irresponsible), and having a white boyfriend (my dad want us to marry a burmese guy).

And my mums favorite line of argument is ""I almost died giving birth to u and it's not worth it).

I am so tired of this culture of parents thinking they own their kids because they gave birth.


But again, in western culture children expects to get a lot from their parents. That parents are simply responsible to give children the best life possible because it's their job.

It feels so strange to me, almost selfish and ungrateful to my ears.
But at the same time my own culture is making me drown in stress, anxiety and a feeling of burden.

Which culture do u think is the most fair?"
investinlady,2021-04-22 09:41:58+00:00,Leaving child for University...,"I haven't seen anyone post about this and I am curious if I am wrong. I am about to be 23, I have a 2 year old daughter and I'm attending a community college. However, I have been wanting to attend UCLA ever since I was in high school but I always thought it'd be impossible. But I am now pursuing it because you only live once. I have my daughter, though. I live about two hours away from UCLA. Would I be a horrible parent to leave my child with my mother and family? My BD would be able to help her as he is still in our daughters life. But, what if he places child support on me? I currently am in the early stage of placing child support on him after two years. The judge has to sign off on the given amount and I've yet to receive a payment. But, I am wondering if I am being selfish for wanting to leave my daughter here, two hours away. I simply can not see how being a UCLA student, working to pay rent of 1,000+ and a babysitter, groceries, etc, in LA. But I see myself doing fine with a roommate and Doordash and school. I love my daughter to death, but if I go through with this, it would benefit us a lot, but I would miss out on so much. I do have the choice of going to this other university around me and I have the green light from my mom to leave my daughter with her and visit on the weekends since the university is about 1h 30m away. Not much of a difference... Who knows if I will leave her but is this wrong, selfish and just plain stupid?"
spikeboy4,2021-04-22 08:02:14+00:00,"My parents are saying my house isn't ""fit for bringing a baby into""","This one may turn into a long one, so apologies in advance.

For background, my wife is due in about 4 weeks. Back in November we started some party major work on the house, knocking through walls, that kind of thing.

In December we ordered some steel beams and new windows and doors. Between covid, brexit etc the didn't arrive until the start of April. So not last minute due to bad planning, just circumstances. 

We need to finish the work so we have space for a nursery. I've had builders in, taken time off work to work on it and basically been busting my ass to try and get all the work done in time. Everything that was downstairs is now in boxes upstairs so it is out of the way, which makes the upstairs pretty cluttered.

My mother, from a genuine place of concern I'm sure, keeps talking about how the dust will be bad for the baby if she arrives early, I should be wiping down all the surfaces and moping every day, I should be paying cleaners to come in a couple of times a week etc.

My wife is 8 months pregnant, works full time and has back and pelvic pain, so I can't exactly ask her to do it every day. I'm now back at work and all my spare time is spent on the house. And if anybody has ever taken a stihl saw to brick wall they will know that brick dust takes days to settle.

I know its a trade off between spending time cleaning and getting the house done sooner, and I can only do my best but as if I wasn't already stressed about getting the house work finished, feeling guilty about pissing off the neighbours with the noise, neglecting my wife and dog by spending all my time either doing building work or working at my job, now I'm getting warnings that my house is dirty and dusty, I'm going to give my baby respiratory problems etc etc.

A similar thing happened to a friend and his parents basically tried to keep the baby and report to social services that the house wasn't fit for a baby.

I don't really know what to do, to be honest. There isn't dust covering every surface or anything, the common areas are clean but areas I can't get to easily still have brick dust. Are they right and I should prioritise cleaning over finishing the work? Should I just tell them to mind their own goddam business and not give me more things to worry about?"

SOS,"My son is just over 5 months and has developed a new love for shrieking at the top of his longs for various reasons. Sometimes it’s because he likes the sound of his own voice, his toy is out of reach, I’m not holding him, I *am* holding him, he’s in the middle of tummy time, he’s laying on his back, etc.... literally anything and everything. He could be beyond happy and screech because of how happy he is. 

However, I’m prone to headaches and migraines and today my son has shrieked so loud and so often that I had a headache so intense that Motrin wouldn’t help and I felt like I was going to pass out.

Forward_Material_378,2021-04-22 03:46:21+00:00,How to explain to my kid why she won’t be invited,"Note: I’m in Australia where covid isn’t an issue, so having get togethers isn’t a problem here. 

My daughter is nearly six and is in her first year of school. She is the most outgoing, loveable, social butterfly I’ve ever met. Everyone who meets her tells me what a wonderful little girl she is. 

Me, on the other hand, am not in any way shape or form. I’m autistic with adhd and I am socially....stupid. I only have a couple of friends and since as long as I can remember I’ve always been pushed out of groups and excluded from everything. Not looking for sympathy, I’m just painting the picture. 

When school started in January I tried so hard with the other mums. I cut out the negativity, made sure I wasn’t talking too much, tried extra hard to read social cues. I thought I was doing ok. Before the Easter holidays I exchanged numbers with my daughters best friend’s mum (J) and we said we’d meet up over the break. I didn’t hear anything the first week so the second week I reached out but they were busy. No big deal, or so I thought. First day back after break I was standing with the group (4 other ladies) and they were talking about all the stuff they did together over the holiday. Every time I started to say anything (not about them leaving us out) J would listen for a few seconds then turn to someone else and talk to them. 

I was back in high school, I started to panic and thankfully the bell rang and we all left. I was upset and I’m now worried about my kids. Gone are the days of dropping your kids off for birthday parties and sleepovers. Now the parents have to stay and be social. And I know that when the parent is a social outcast that the kids don’t get invited places (Easter break being the first of many examples I’m sure we will encounter)

So how do I explain to my wonderful, bubbly social butterfly (and her brothers in coming years) that the reason she is always left out isn’t because of her but because her mother just isn’t likeable? I could care less if they don’t like me but my heart just hurts for my little girl 😥"

I’ve honestly been stuck in this depression, I feel lonely, I want friends. I want a break. My daughter is with me all the time and I don’t have any family members willing to watch her while I take a night for myself or something. I am a young mom so I watch as all my peers (I’m 22) go out, find love, start loving, stable families of their own where both parents are available. I can’t help but envy those people. My child was not expected in the slightest, and my child’s dad was the one to convince me that I CAN parent, even when I knew I couldn’t. I’m a good mom but I just know I wasn’t meant to have a child so early on, as I grew up pretty innocent and over-protected and had a lot more living and financial work left to do before having kids. It feels bad to be saying this but I’m just so so depressed and sad knowing that this is really my life now. I really do envy those who have a nice family they can depend on for babysitting, or honestly just a nice family in general. I grew up in a broken family and am now trying to navigate parenthood in a way that breaks the “generational curse”. It’s super hard and I try my best each and every day but it gets so exhausting."
Texangonenorth,2021-04-22 01:21:51+00:00,Need Advice re FMLA / STD,"Husband and I are 32 weeks along tomorrow. LO is due June 17.

Both of us are working currently but are intending of course to take time off for baby’s arrival.

He gets four weeks paid of parental leave to take that can be used however he likes as long as it’s taken before baby’s 1st birthday.

I can use Short term disability, FMLA (though I am not eligible until my employer anniversary of July 13), and PTO if I wish (granted I have just over a week saved up).
12 weeks from July 13 is the first week of October. So assuming baby comes around actual due date that could be 16 weeks of time off and STD only covers 5 weeks and obviously it’s not full coverage.

Additional factors to know: we live in an apartment and our lease needs to be renewed and as expected rent is going up.
The cheapest option is signing for a 15 month lease that would be $66 dollars more than our current amount.
Another option is buying a house (in a market that favors the seller and in month 8/9 of a pregnancy).
Our insurance is through my husbands employer so his check brings in less than mine does. Adding a child to the plan will only worsen this of course.
We would be putting our child into daycare once I return to work.

I am curious to hear how others managed going down an income for a few months when you’re bringing a baby into the world."

He has specifically asked about Ramadan, and wants to fast because his school friend is currently fasting and told him ""God will reward him"". It seems he driven by the idea that God will give him material things that he wishes for. I've explained the best I could that God doesn't reward you with material things, and that there is a lot he needs to learn before just committing to Ramadan and fasting. That we also need to educate ourselves if we want to help him learn. We told him as he gets older he can explore the many religions of the world, but at this time we can't just start fasting without understanding why it's done."

The minute I got to my moms to pick the baby up, she started complaining about how fussy she was, how she eats too much (she literally had 3 bottles in the 8 hours she was there that’s completely normal), how she doesn’t nap long enough, and basically how exhausting it was to watch her. My mom looked beyond miserable and I honestly got a bad vibe. Just to put it in perspective, my daughter is a super happy baby and generally only cries when she’s hungry. My mother in law had her two days this week and both days commented on how awesome she was and how much she enjoyed having her. I do not feel comfortable leaving my daughter with my mom again and at this point I’m not willing to do so. I have to find a kind but firm way to let her know.I keep second guessing myself but I don’t think I’m being too harsh. My mom is not a patient woman, she walked out on me when I was 6 and I didn’t see her again until I was 17.  She’s just not motherly.

Kmariam,2021-04-22 00:57:07+00:00,6 year old daughter has had intense anxiety. Looking for advice.,"I will preface this by saying I have bad anxiety, particularly about health related issues. I have worked so hard to keep those thoughts and obsessions at bay and haven’t had any major worries for the last two years with therapy and meds. 

On Saturday night my 6 year old randomly threw up. She complained of a stomach ache, said my food smelled bad (has always hated seafood smells), then threw up a very large amount. She felt fine after throwing up but wouldn’t eat anything. Was tired and slept the entire night (rare because she always comes into my bed). I knew of a few other kids who had the stomach bug at the school and chalked it up to a quick thing. 

Sunday she woke up feeling better but Sunday night around dinner time had a major anxiety episode thinking about how she threw up. She was shaking and refusing to eat dinner. I comforted her as best as I could and didn’t force the eating issue. The last time she threw up she was 2 years old, so I totally understood why she was having such a  strong reaction to the puking episode-it was definitely scary for her. 

Monday was better, but yesterday and today she continues to bring it up constantly. I tried taking her to the movies today since it’s April vacation week and she wanted to leave in the middle of the movie because she said she was staring to feel nervous. She has always been an anxious child, so I’m used to strong reactions from her, but this is definitely the most intense I have seen. I’ve also noticed some OCD Type of behaviors lately too- counting, talking about germs and hand washing (although the school is really hammering them with that type of stuff due to COVID), and she has developed a type of vocal tic where she’s constantly throat clearing while stressed. When I ask her about it she says it makes her feel better when she is nervous. Today she was leaning in a weird position for a while doing blocks and said her neck hurt and she was terrified her neck was broken (we do have a friend who recently broke an arm and she has been very fixated on it). She says she keeps thinking about throwing up and being sick. 

I’ve tried everything I can think of- we read a book about worries, I told her we could make a “worry monster”, etc. i left a message for her pedi tonight to see what they recommend, but this is really throwing me for a loop and triggering my anxiety trying to figure out what is going on, and I feel responsible for all of this since I struggle with the exact same type of fears, although I do my best to keep mine at bay and away from my kids."

therealrizzo5,2021-04-22 00:24:35+00:00,Female Toddler Being Touched? Help please.,"Hi all.
I have a two and a half year old (will be three in August) and she has April vacation this week and my grandparents are helping out. I trust my parents and my in-laws FULLY but my mom has a boyfriend both in their early 60's (they've been dating for over 6 years) and he's quiet but always a nice guy and I don't necessarily have a reason not to trust him.

Today when we were getting ready for bed my daughter said her bum (vagina) hurts. Not totally out of the ordinary because everytime she says her bum hurts (wiping too hard from trying to get poop off) we give her some lotion to put on it. She's been on a big lotion kick but she was just starting to buck the trend but tonight she took off her PJs and said her bum hurt BUT she said it hurt inside.

It's hard to ask her questions without her just saying yes. If you try to ask her direct questions she'll usually just agree.
But she said it hurt inside and it was from grampy and grammy. Assuming she had a poop and they were aggressive wiping. The fact that she also said ""grammy"" wouldn't make sense because I know my mom wouldn't do anything like that but when I asked if it was ""grampy"" she would say ""grampy and grammy"".

Her vagina doesn't appear red or any different than usual. She wasnt acting any different than normal tonight but I just don't know what to do.
I asked my mom and she said nothing happened (which I believe she wouldn't go along with anything like that if she knew about it) and said she had a poop but I just really really don't know how to approach this. Based on the room setup it's impossible to setup a camera at the changing table without being obvious - and it would be hard to get a clear shot anyways.

Thanks for any help."
ermonda,2021-04-22 00:21:29+00:00,4 year olds and empathy,"I am concerned about my 4 year old daughter’s lack of empathy. I have had 2 miscarriages in the past 6 months. Both times it happened she was with me and it was hard to hide my emotions. I spent both days crying. Not loud or dramatic crying but tears streaming down my face most of the day. I don’t typically ever cry so it’s not like it’s normal for her to see me like that. 

On both occasions I was clearly very upset and not myself and my daughter didn’t acknowledge or seem to care. Instead she would look me right in the eyes and ask me to play a game, turn on TV, get something to eat, etc. I found it really odd that she didn’t ask if I was ok or question why I was crying/upset. This last time I even asked her if she noticed that I was crying and she just kind of shrugged her shoulders. I told her that I was having a really hard time, not feeling well etc but she didn’t seem to care. 

I’m not necessarily looking for sympathy from her but it worries me that she doesn’t seem to recognize or care when someone close to her is in pain and at least offer a hug. I think I model empathy often and we read books about feelings and helping others but she often makes it about herself. 

Am I right to think that she should be more empathetic or are most 4 year olds like this? What can I do to get her to be more concerned about others feelings?"

He asked me to fill out everything, file everything. He agreed to pretty much whatever because he didn’t want to hire a lawyer. He wouldn’t complete the required coparenting class, and after failing to enroll our son in school back in August, I took over primary custody. We live in different states, about 3 hours away. My new partner and I have made every effort to drive my son there after school on Friday, to turn around and drive the 3 hours home, just to do it all again on Sunday. Twice a month, sometimes more. My ex has never been to our state since our son moved in with me in August. I am now pregnant. My boyfriend has been a big help, and we plan to get married eventually. My ex says he accepts that my bf will be our son’s step dad.  I became very sick (I underwent treatment for cancer last year and being pregnant has been hard on my health). My son is excited to have a new sibling. He started asking if my bf would still like him, help him and play with him when the baby is born. He has a good relationship with my bf and is a very anxious little boy. 

I have our son call his dad every night. Recently after one call I received an angry text from my ex saying I needed to talk to our son because he referred to my bf as dad. He said it has happened before and he is my son’s only dad. I pointed out we have never told our son, nor encouraged in the slightest for him to call my bf dad. We have always referred to my bf by his first name, and usually our son does too. I also said he is young and after visiting there I myself get called dad or grandma for a while. He insisted I talk to our son. I had no idea what exactly he wanted me to say. Our son knows my bf is not his dad. We’ve had the talk about what a step parent is and how the baby will be his half sibling. He’s 8. And I feel telling him he can’t call this person that has basically helped raise him for the past 9 months dad will make him unnecessarily upset. My ex also has custody of our teen, and he does not ensure I even speak to her once a week. I don’t ask for child support. I am literally the only one putting in effort to ensure he even sees our son. I later found out that what had actually prompted this text was our son saying he had to ask “his parents” if he could do something. He didn’t even specifically call my bf dad. But since I had to have this awkward conversation reminding him my bf isn’t his dad,  he has started to call him dad. I’m not sure what to do here."

baddieheifer,2021-04-22 00:10:28+00:00,Silent Treatment,"Reddit, 

How do you guys feels about parents giving their children the silent treatment?

Quick background on my parents, they were never married, but had 3 of us. They never loved each other, but chose stay together under the same roof once the had my oldest brother. As a result there are now three of us. Because there was no love between our parents, we grew up constantly witnessing their fights and insults. By the time I was 5 or 6, they had their major, scandalous fight that ended up with them giving each other the silent treatment for over 20 years (I am now 25 years old). They still live under the same roof (because of my mom’s mental health issues, she cannot live on her own), and I’m the last sibling to still live with them. 

Anyway, my parents have also picked fights with myself and my two older siblings in the past. The thing is, every time I fight with them, I too get the silent treatment from them. The worst ones have been from my dad. My mom usually gets over it within a week. The first time my dad gave me the silent treatment, I was 15 years old and it was over me giving my neighbors our wifi password (fuck me for being very neighborly). That one lasted about 2 weeks. About 4 weeks ago, I got into another of many arguments with my dad over me not wanting to help him with something related to the phone. It’s not that I don’t want to help him, it’s that he always fucking complains that I don’t show him things correctly, which honestly makes me not want to help him. Don’t insult the help you’re getting!!

Anyway, the argument ended with him saying that I don’t deserve to be respected and that if I didn’t like it, to leave his house. I was so pissed and I walked away. He has not spoken to me since. 

My thing with silent treatments is that I feel people use that to get away with not apologizing. In my 25 years of existing I have NEVER gotten a single apology from them. I on the other hand am known to be the most emotional and sensitive in the family so I always apologize when I’m in the wrong. I know they’re my parents but I just want to pull them by their ears and yell that I want an apology. Especially my stubborn dad. This has been the longest silent treatment I’ve gotten. To be honest, I don’t mind it now because I’m an adult and I’m logical, and I’m this case I know I’m not in the wrong. Also I at least have some peace. But as a child it fucked me up. I always felt like I was the bad person and I feel like that’s why I always avoid speaking up and confronting others. 

I think giving your kids the silent treatment can be emotionally draining for them and I wish parents understood that."
MrReeRee,2021-04-21 23:54:59+00:00,MEH Days.,"My  husband and I were raised in households where education trumped mental health, we were never given days off when our minds and souls needed it. And goodness, sometimes we just needed them.

 Fast forward 20 years and we are parents of 6 amazing kids (from 4-15). Very early on we introduced MEH Days. Mental and Emotional Health Days. Kids have enough pressure as it is, especially my older 4 in high school, one day to watch movies, eat junk food and cuddle with mum isn't such a big deal.

Kids mental health is so important in this day and age, and as a mental health sufferer myself, I hope I can educate my kids that taking a day to reset is more than ok."

Please help,"My 20 year brother is living on his own in an apartment, is manic depression/bipolar disorder, self destructive and is going up to 4 days at a time without eating and, won't seek help. He is mentally abusive to my father. It's taken a toll on my father as he tries to bring meals to my brother's apartment just so has something to eat. A lot of times my brother doesn't open the door for him. My brother should be on medication but isn't taking it. In my opinion, he isnt capable of living on his own and should be admitted to a subsidized group home where he will be given meals, and be under care. I don't live in the US, but he lives there and I'm seeking advice as to what my father and I could do to get him help... My brother contiplated suicide last year, and I feel like it could happen someday if he doesn't get help. He's had cops at his apartment a few times, and admitted to a hospital for 3 days last year, in which he was back to normal when given medication but flushed them down the toilet after 2 weeks. He is seriously incapable of living on his own.

Advice please on what I should do. I know he's an ADULT now, but he's mentally incapable and It breaks my heart having my father be so scared to see if he's starving himself or is destroying himself. 

Thanks so much - we just need some advice on this as calling the cops and admiring to a hospital for 3 days doesn't do anything. He just throws out his medication."
an0therFate,2021-04-21 23:27:54+00:00,Is this a fair parenting set up between my wife and I?,"
We have have a 7 month old boy.  My wife watches him all day when I’m at work, any time between 6am to 4pm.  Just this week she started working her seasonal dispatching job from home.  So she hasn’t been working since October of last year when baby was born.  When I get home I’m pretty much on dad duty the rest of the night.  So I get up at 6am to go to work and get home around 4pm.

I just feel like I am over worked all day every day.  I’m tired when I get off work (half labor half desk job typically) then I have to watch him the rest of the night anytime between 8-11pm depending on the night with no naps because I have the non nap baby.

Meanwhile my wife gets to lay in bed, watch her stocks, be on tik tok, and take a bath every night (sometimes 2 a night) while I’m in the baby’s room all night playing with him.  The only free time I get is after he goes to bed.  I can get a few things done around the house at night but not much.  Then I have to watch him on the baby monitor all night.  Sometimes he goes to bed earlier like around 8pm but will then wake up again and I will have to tend to him again.  Our current agreement is that I have to get up and feed him if he wakes up anytime before 3am if he wakes and she takes care of anything after.  He usually gets up around 3 or 4 am every night.

I am just wondering what fellow parents think of this.  Is it wrong that I feel like I’m tired and overworked and I don’t get much help at all in the evenings.

She does feed him most of his meals during the day and clean up most of the poopy diapers during the day.  Sometimes I’ll get one at night and I’ll feed him dinner and some bottles at night.  So there are some trade offs but I just feel like the scales are tipped in her favor of having time to unwind.  And I just hardly feel like there is much of that for me.

Edit: and actually I don’t really “unwind” that much.  It’s usually time I spend cleaning or fixing up my house.  Occasionally I’ll watch a movie or read."

If you think you're gonna be offended, I suggest you to better not read further and just ignore this post.
Content warning: sex education, pornography 

I know this may sound weird and even inappropriate at first, but please hear me out before you make bad assumptions. I'm a teacher (M32) and I teach kids who are 7-12 years old. Kids are often really loud while on breaks and I overhear weird and silly stuff a lot. Usually I just laugh it off. But I could never ignore something I've heard that one time. Long story short, a 12 year old kid had no idea what sex exactly was. They said they heard of it (obviously) but never understood what it is. And that really got me questioning our entire school system. How could we let this happen? Poor kid is probably even made fun of because their parents didn't teach them about basic human biology and nature. And on top of that, they're gonna be very confused when puberty starts. I think we as adults are very responsible for explaining the topics of sex, birth, hormones and human bodies in general without making it taboo. So after some thinking I've come to the conclusion. We should expose kids to pornography. I don't mean any kind. Anything that's unrealistic and straight up gross is off the list. But if we could carefully choose and make a playlist of good porn videos that potray basic act of sex (safe and protected sex) we would help them understand it much better. Sex is a normal part of our lives. And sexual urges occur when children go through puberty. Instead of banning pornographic content and shaming them for *normal* changes they go through, we should start being more transparent with them. And I don't think verbal communication is enough. When they hear about it, they'd be curious and probably search up porn themselves. But everyone knows that also causes anxiety and guilt because they might feel like they're doing something wrong and therefore they will hide it from their parents. And when something seems forbidden, you know how that goes. It just becomes more appealing to them and they start watching porn in secret. And who knows what kind of porn.... think about it. If you don't want your kid to look at all kinds of pretty gross stuff and develop porn addiction by the time they are young adults, I think picking out more appropriate pornography specifically for them might be of very positive effect on them. Getting familiar with sex while being accepted and supported by their parents in such confusing period of their lives would help them develop healthier view on sex. And since they are also visual learners, that knowledge may come in handy later when they find a partner. I even think it's kind of embarassing to be 12 and not know about sex, but obviously I don't blame the kid. What are your thoughts on this? Does this make any sense to you? 

All I know is that when I become a parent, I'm gonna educate them and encourage them to watch porn.
Also, I'd like to note that by sex I don't only refer to heterosexual ""penis-to-vagina"" intercourse. We should educate them about all kinds of sex and explain different sexualities to them. Don't assume your kids sexuality and don't force heteronormative views on sex and relationships when there's so much more to learn. I'm curious about your opinions on this."
Meagazilla89,2021-04-21 21:53:56+00:00,What do you do when gentle parenting isn’t working (age 3),My son is very energetic and we have tried our best to channel his energy towards positive outcome but he just really seems to like to do things he knows is naughty or unkind.

sometimesuzerian,2021-04-21 21:46:21+00:00,"Opinions needed: in-laws took 3 yr old too long during an emergency, changed plan, etc...","tl;dr: My son loves his grandparents who took him too long. They changed the plan, he's having a blast, and basically I'm butthurt. I am I entirely wrong, partially, or what?

Longer version: wife's parents watched our son for a few days during an emergency, and since I never nailed down details (because emergency chaos) they ended up taking him 3 hours away and dragging it out longer than I liked. The plan for 4-5 days watching him at our home turned into 2 at ours, 2-3 at theirs. Then it became 5 at ours, plus 2 at theirs. Which then became 3 at theirs. ""X-day morning"" became afternoon. Here it is day 8 and I've yet to see my son. 

Partially, what irks me is that we never really needed them to take him away, it was more for them (and him?) than us. I feel they thought they knew what was better for him and were intentionally vague about the plan so they could do it. My wife and I were in a bind and they took advantage of it. 

What also bothers me, maybe selfishly on my part or maybe not, was how attached he became to them and detached from us. We saw him briefly the first time in 5 days for 30 minutes before they left. He wanted nothing to do with me, clutching grandma, yelling at me, obsessed. It was heart-breaking. My wife's parents love him like their own son and he has an absolute blast with them and on their property (complete with farm animals, machines, ponds, other relatives, etc). They also of course indulge in TV and candy and things I wouldn't allow. 

Overall just wondering how excessively big a deal I'm making about this. Wife and I have fought about it the past 2 days. She thinks I'm an insecure selfish asshole and need to move on. But I just love this kid beyond words can convey, missed him, and have trouble balancing my desire to see him happy with that to shape who he becomes. 

In the bigger picture, and for many reasons I won't go into, I can see his grandparents having the overwhelming influence on who he becomes. I think he would be thrilled with that, my wife would, her parents would, everyone would but it wouldn't sit well with me."

My 13 month old has always sprouted teeth early. She already has 4 top, 4 bottom, 1 molar on the lower right and she is now suffering through 1 molar on the lower left. 

She just transitioned to the young toddler room in daycare and today they called me to pick her up because she was inconsolable. They rocked her, hugged her, told her it was okay. I try not to overdo it on the Tylenol, I’ve tried cold washcloths, teething toys, rubber duckies, etc.

I know she will be fine long term but she will be ok and then just start screaming and crying and pulling at her ears. I’ve taken her to the doctor twice and no fever, no sign of ear infection, just teething! 🦷

an0n_lala,2021-04-21 21:10:14+00:00,10 year old daughter refuses to come home because I took away her cell phone,"I share custody of my daughter with her father, it’s basically 50/50. For her birthday in October she was gifted a cell phone against my better judgement but I allowed her to use and took it away as a punishment whenever she was out of line. When she received a failing grade due to not submitting her homework, I told her that if I received another failing grade on her next report card her phone would be confiscated for the entire semester. She failed to get her grades up so I did just that. 

This last weekend, she asked to join her best friend as they were taking a day trip to LA for her birthday. I said sure, she was given $50 for the trip. She asked to have her cell phone for the trip. Now I know she can be fussy in traffic, and I wanted to be able to track her in case of emergencies. So I handed it over but told her she’d be giving it back once she came home. This is the first time she’s had her phone in months.

All while this is happening my father is moving into my house that weekend. She comes home on Sunday in a good mood. She greets her grandfather, helps with maybe two boxes out of the uhual, and retreats to her room to play on her phone.

My father invites us all to lunch. My daughter says a few sideways comments, throws a napkin and drops her orange juice all over the table. At this point I’m a little annoyed. She goes to the restroom to clean up and I grab the phone off the table and put it in my pocket. Upon returning home she takes a three hour nap while we get my dad moved in.

When she wakes up she’s very upset and asks me for the cell phone. I said no, you knew the deal. She starts going off on tangents about all the things she dislikes about me and says she wants to go stay with her father. She’s crying at this point. After trying to ration with her I give up and tell her to leave and not to come back until she is ready to act right. You can probably guess she hasn’t returned.

What would you do in my situation?"

BlueberryBunnies,2021-04-21 20:52:58+00:00,2.5 year old cries at specific Bluey episode. Should I be concerned?,"So we absolutely love the television show Bluey. We've seen all the episodes multiple times over. The episode Sleepytime actually makes my daughter cry. This is the only thing that makes her cry outside getting hurt, tantrums, etc. 

Now let me just say, if you've seen this particular episode, it has all the feels. The music is from Holst's, Jupiter, a fairly emotionally invoking piece on its own. The episode is basically an endearing sum up of children growing up.  I actually avoid watching it because I completely sob. I have hidden this from my daughter, she has not seen me cry. For those of you that know this episode, I'm sure plenty of you have cried from it as well, it is superbly written and just hits all those sappy notes of parenting. 

I just want to know if this is something to be concerned about, becoming overcome with sadness at such a young age. I have tried explaining that it's ok, it is just Bingo's dream, she is waking up now to start a new day. We've watched it together and I've explained it the entire episode. No matter what, she always gets sad and cries from it. She has not shown any kind of sadness anywhere else in her life.

For what it's worth, I cry at everything even remotely endearing, which has only amplified since becoming a parent. I suppose I'm just concerned if perhaps my child is feeding off me, and I don't want her to have my anxiety, which I wouldn't wish on anyone. I try to keep things like my anxiety hidden from her.

Ghanimaofarrakis,2021-04-21 20:48:14+00:00,Is this weird?,"So a few weeks ago I found two new plastic sleds placed on my porch, no note. Sent messages to my family and in laws, no one copped to the gift. I thought maybe a wrong delivery, or they blew away from someone's porch and someone saw them and assumed they were ours. 

Then today I found a wooden snowman decoration with a note attached ""Last day to build a snowman kids"" on the porch. Again family and friends all say it wasn't them. And I don't recognize the handwriting on the note.

So I assume then a neighbour? Except we pretty well keep to ourselves and in the almost decade we've lived in our house we've never really interacted with any neighbours. 

Maybe it's someone trying to be nice, but it feels weird that a stranger has noticed kids live in this house and is gifting them things. I can't figure out if this is sweet or creepy. 

What do you think?"

staycebear30,2021-04-21 20:33:18+00:00,My neighbor thinks I'm horrible..,"Please don't tell me I'm horrible for thinking this. What do you all think?! 

My daughter frequently plays with the girl next door, they are pretty close in age. Daughter is 8, the neighbors daughter is 10. I have rules put on my girl for when she's outside. No leaving the garden and going where I can't see or hear her, and she certainly cannot play on the road behind us, as it's right off the highway and there is a high bridge. Now, this is where I have my concerns...

The neighbors daughter, only 10 years old, always has to bring the 4 year old wherever she goes. These children never have parental supervision and they literally have no boundaries to where they go. It's really not safe in my opinion. Anything could happen. So I spoke with the girls and explained the little one needs to be with their mommy or daddy. Their parents think I was totally in the wrong and now won't allow my daughter to play with theirs because she can't have the 4 year old tag along.  I don't know what to do in this situation. It honestly feel like I have to be outside, babysitting this little one while the big girls play. While their parents are nowhere to be seen. I'm really uncomfortable with a child so little not having supervision while playing on swings and slides. Sorry, it's just how I feel.

Do you think I was in the wrong for this?"

gaychitect,2021-04-21 19:47:38+00:00,How do you handle your child wanting to quit a hobby just because it gets harder?,"My youngest son (8), has been taking riding lessons for about a year. His instructor says he is a natural and very good for his age. Recently, he has expressed to us that he wants to quit. When asked why, he said because it’s getting too hard. It’s the only specific reason he can give. As he progresses, he is taught things that are more and more advanced. So yes, it gets harder. However, that pretty much applies to anything. 

In the short term, we told him that we prepay for lessons, and they don’t do refunds (which has the benefit of actually being true). He has to finish the ones we already paid for. All that did was buy us some time.

I’m a firm believer in the fact that forcing kids to do something is one of the quickest ways to make them hate it. It’s just not productive. 

However..... I’m worried about establishing a precedent of it being ok to quit something just because it’s difficult. Things that are fulfilling and worth doing are rarely easy. I don’t want to raise kids that give up as soon as things gets hard. 

I’m stuck between a rock and hard place with two contradicting but equally important principles.

Any ideas?"

ifimhereimrealbored,2021-04-21 19:02:36+00:00,"I'm not a stay at home mom, but my husband forgets that","Since Covid, I've been working from ""home"" with our toddler. My husband is an essential worker who still goes into an office. My husband is amazing; he's a great father and partner and he's thoughtful and patient and funny and kind. But sometimes he seems to forget that just because I'm with our kid everyday and I don't go into a physical office, I'm not a stay at home mom.

We're extremely fortunate to have both sets of grandparents within an hour's drive and one of them helps everyday so I can get work done. Some days my son and I drive 40 minutes to my parents', some days my MIL comes to our condo. But the grandparents are in their 70s. So I'm very involved throughout the day giving them breaks, dealing with toddler tantrums, making decisions, changing diapers, planning and cooking meals, begging a toddler to eat, etc. And of course the grandparents have lives of their own, so there's constant rearranging of schedules and changing my working hours to accomodate.

It's the decision fatigue that's killing me. 3 meals a day with my kid, for 13 months. Endless decisions that balance my work, my kid's needs, and the needs of two grandmothers. Plus prioritizing my work for the limited time I have. Add in decisions based on Covid safety - like whether it's ok for my son to go to the park or play outside with a neighbor or go to the grocery store...

So when my husband just gets dressed in the morning and walks out the door, leaving me to pick out weather-appropriate kid clothes, figure out breakfast, pack up, etc. Or when he comes home and asks what's for dinner or says he's too tired to put our son down. Well, I just want to scream. I know this is the age old problems of ""mental load"" falling traditionally on the mom. And he and I have discussed it at length. He tries to help. And he does help, a little. But he just... forgets.

Anyone have words of wisdom for me on how to change or just make peace with the situation?"

The issue is, he wakes up everyday around 5:00 or 5:30 in morning. We've tried to lay with him or let him cry it out to see if he'll sleep a little more. No dice. He falls asleep either in his high chair, my arms, or the couch by 11:00 the latest and naps for an hour or two. When he wakes up, he refuses to eat lunch. He also picks at his dinner.

Livelaughloser2315,2021-04-21 18:07:36+00:00,My child is afraid of other kids. How can I help?,"My 4.5 year old has been in daycares since 6 months old, and was always happy to play with other kids. 

We were in lockdown for 2 months last year and then right after that, she started at a new home daycare with 6 other kids. She likes it there, the kids absolutely adore her, and she likes them too. No cases of bullying whatsoever. The daycare is pretty transparent, and most of the kids are babies and toddlers anyways. 

The problem is that since June last year, she’s been anxious and scared of kids outside her daycare. When we go to the playground (the same one we’ve been going to for years), she refuses to play with the kids, or even climb up the play structures if even a single kid is there. 
 
She wants to play on the structures, but seeing other kids there makes her scared. She’ll run away if a kid even approaches her. She tells me “I’m scared of the kids” but she won’t explain why. 

I always tell her that I’m right there with her to help if needed, that she’s safe, the kids are nice, etc, but to no avail. Sometimes I even try to talk to the kids and “break the ice”, and they’re usually SO friendly and willing to play with her but she flat out rejects them. I’m out of strategies here! 

Even the daycare has noticed her strange fear of outsiders too, and they’ve expressed their concern to me. 

It’s absolutely heartbreaking to see her WANT to play at the park but not have the courage to do it just because other kids are there. I’m feeling hopeless as nothing I’m doing is helping her overcome this. 

Any other parents gone through this and can offer help? Is a mental health counselor useful for 4 year olds?"
Vulgarbrando,2021-04-21 17:53:19+00:00,Live in nephew,"So my sister in law and nephew moved in with me and my wife, my sister in law is in and out of a divorce and working 2nds, my wife commutes to work, and I am a stay at home dad to my 1.5 year old son. 

My nephew went to schooling out of state and in order to enroll in schooling my sister in law needs to change her address to a one in the school district. So he instead is enrolled in online learning for his school. He is not an academic, understandable I didn’t have eyes on me at all times for schooling or my downtime in between, here is the issue, he isn’t even trying.

My sister in law has taken away all of his stuff, he has chores to do at my house which I would rather do to get them done, and I feel obligated to try and get him on the right path, but that is extremely difficult while trying to raise my own. He “does” his school work for competition and has poor grades. He always says his goal is to be able to live on his own so he doesn’t have to do school or housework. 

I don’t really know if I do anything to help the kid I have tried with his homework I usually attempt at my sons nap, one day it rolled into a 4 hour geometry lesson which resulted in nothing. His mom and him have the same argument over him being the punching bag of this divorce, of which he isn’t because he has gotten a two week vacation during the first portion of living with me in Minecraft world. He now either pretends to do school work or takes naps. Him and my sister in law have laid out a schedule with rewards, and me and my wife have tried to reward him with shows to watch with us if school work is completed.

I know 14 is a tough age, and I know that sometimes letting go and learning from failure is a big step in maturity, but with what I have tried to tell him is a “fresh start” he seems to want the easiest way back to gaming.

lhousekey,2021-04-21 17:39:38+00:00,What to do when your kid is ungrateful about everything?,"My 8 yo daughter came home from a sleepover (with a friend she loves) and had nothing but negative things to say about it. Didn’t like the food, didn’t like the games they played, just didn’t have a great time. She was literally bawling because it was such a disappointment. She started crying even thinking about how they “ruined” her taco by adding sour cream in it with cabbage. 

I usually say I’m sorry it didn’t go as expected, but you need to think of the positives. I usually have her make a list of things she was grateful for. Often that causes more stress because she just wants to sit with her negativity for a while. 

I am possibly a toxic optimist, I’m not sure. But I can’t relate to wanting to sit and stew and agonize about something that long; crying and screaming like a newborn. 

I’m trying to balance letting her sit in her negative feelings and bring her back to reality; nothing was objectively wrong with the sleepover and she needs to adjust her expectations. We worry that she’s never going to be happy with anything. She reacts like this to every small disappointment. 

How do you parents navigate this?"

lalucklady,2021-04-21 17:29:44+00:00,I feel triggered by my 7 year old's emotions,"So my son is 7 years old. He lives in his feelings. He has no qualms about crying, and has always been emotionally expressive (I'm upset because.... I'm crying because I feel...etc). If there are times when we say ""dont cry"", he will defensively remind us that it's ok to have feelings. 

I honestly love this about him. But it can be draining to deal with someone who leans into their feelings all the time. While he is communicative, I worry about his emotional regulation because it feels like he has a hard time soothing himself. If hes upset he always needs to cry or meltdown about it and then have a conversation about it. The conversation is less draining, but the meltdowns trigger me. I've always been super sensitive to sounds and his crying is like nails on a chalk board. Especially being in quarantine, this has been exacerbated.  Hes home more and therefore feels comfortable in expressing all his emotions all the time.  (He does not melt like this at school, usually). Also, he's with me all the time and I'm trying to balance working from home and dealing with his school work and I don't really have a break. 

His dad is in his masters program and has finals coming up. Usually he's solid in navigating my son's emotions, but he's so stressed I feel like I'm a little caught between two emotionally intense people. We dont live close enough to family to have that kind of support. My kid is only in school for two more weeks, so outsourcing help at this point isn't really a solid solution. 

I need help in not being so reactive to my son's meltdowns and probably some help with his emotional regulation. Any tools or insights would be amazing."

I was hoping to get some view points and thoughts on my 14 year old SS (Step Son). We recently took full custody of him this past school year for him to focus on a school near us. Since then, he has mainly been remote (Due to COVID) and has been failing every class. Not only does he fail, he will not accept help, he lies about his grades and just doesn't seem to care.

We have offered him assistance, taken him to tutors (Home and Away), and nothing seems to help. He just will not accept someone helping him. We recently had him tested and his math and reading are still at middle school levels.

To only add to that, over the past several months, he has increased his lying to us and not taking accountability of his actions. We actually have him on camera doing things that he denies even doing. We have been in and out of both family and individual therapy. We have tried positive and negative reinforcement to no avail. My marriage is on the fritz due to all of this stress.

Lately, we noticed him saying he ""lost"" money that we had given him (He earned) and noticed him still money from our savings jar. However, the other day, we found that he had taken edibles (too much) to the point of where he was shaking and thought he was really sick. The only way we knew is because he was scared. We are at a loss of what to do. We recently took his phone and went through it to only find more lies. I understand teenagers try things, however, that coupled with the fact that he is failing everything, lying, not taking accountability, screams a lot more to me then just experimenting. 

We talked to a child therapist who said that we should take everything and not allow him for the time being to talk with his friends until his behavior reverses.

We are at a loss as we have tried to do everything."

Because he's becoming obsessed, my wife and I decided that we should probably back away from watching too much television. Lately he's becoming more and more pushy about watching. 

After telling him repeatedly that we aren't going to watch TV that night, I thought it would otherwise be fun to play some songs from the sound track for him as background music, instead of staring at the black mirror. 

Boy was I wrong.....

He heard the intro song ""Real Gone"" by Sheryl Crow. He stopped playing abruptly, JUMPED up, RAN to the TV, and immediately started BAWLING that the movie was NOT in fact playing. He carried on for 15 minutes begging to watch Cars. 

I felt sooooo terrible about it. I didn't think through the fact that he doesn't understand the difference between a movie and music, etc. To him it's all just a ""thing"" that he enjoys and it's all lumped into one blob."

I always thought the rule of thumb was if your kid is sick you stay home with them? That’s what my husband and I did while I was working. We’d never ask anyone to watch our kid while she was sick, one of us would call off. They both can afford to call off work (whereas my husband and I had to scrape by even when we got full paychecks).

We have a 12 year old with autism, ADHD and depression.  He’s on medication for the depression, which has helped a lot, and has been in counseling with a social worker, which is less helpful because he never tells her much and just assures her he’s fine.  The truth is that he has become fixated on violence, and has extremely disturbing, extremely detailed fantasies about murder that he thinks about constantly.  The targets are random internet celebrities who he hates for no clear reason.  We have tried repeatedly to explain these are real people who have done nothing to him, if he doesn’t like something he can ignore it, and there’s a big difference between disliking someone (okay) and wanted to kill them (never okay).  I am terrified he will somehow get access to weapons someday and do something.  We do everything we can to limit his internet time at home, but with the pandemic, he’s in school all day on his laptop, and the teachers can’t babysit what he’s doing every minute.  His whole life, he has been intense and difficult, and would get stuck on certain subjects, but they never scared me like this does.  All of the mental health counseling places we’ve called are either fully booked until the fall, or cost far more than we can afford (one place told me today it was $300/hour, no insurance accepted).  I just don’t know what to do."

My son is the happiest baby ever, but I’ve noticed that when he can’t do something like put his blocks together, or put Woodys hat on woody, he gets angry and throws them and then throws anything that’s in his way and screams. Or bite whatever is in his hand really hard and his face will turn red. I ignore him when this happens bc I don’t want him to think it’s okay to be that way towards little things. Everyone close to me seems to think it’s normal, but I don’t think it is, idk why it’s just the way he gets so mad and throws a fit like that. And just recently I’ve noticed that when I smack his hand and tell him no when he’s grabbing something he’s not supposed to, he’ll smack me back, but I don’t know what to do after that bc I’m not going to smack his hand again and make him think it’s a game. I guess I’m just worried bc his father has anger issues (were not together anymore) and I don’t want my son to be that way, although I probably can’t help it."
Sithfacedxx,2021-04-21 15:08:22+00:00,What are you supposed to do when punishments don't work?,"Kid is 15. 

What are you actually suppose to do to discipline a child who doesn't care about being disciplined? It's the good ol tale of: once a kid realizes that punishments only work if you follow them, you lose all power in the situation. 

We're at a loss of what to do anymore. 

My boyfriend's son has recently become very troubled. He doesn't live with us, but was sent to live with us for a few weeks about 2 months ago, by his mother. He didn't want to transfer to school out here and we couldn't pick up his medication because he's not on our insurance (too expensive out of pocket). The reason he was sent to stay with us in the first place is because he was caught smoking, skipping class (hiding in the bathroom all day), fighting with step dad, running away and giving his pills away to his friends. Grounding him and taking away his phone obviously doesn't work. Literally the day after he went back to his mom's house, he stole a bottle of Tequila and brought it to school and got him and his friends drunk. he was arrested and currently has charges pending against him. He's now been ""excused from school"" pretty much for the rest of the school year, sounds like. He's also run away again, after ditching school yesterday. This will be the third runaway since I've been with the father, which is less than a year. Last time he ran away he admitted himself into the children's psych ward and had to stay for 7 days."

My daughter went through a phase where she would never take them off, she slept with them on, cried when she couldn’t wear them in the tub, etc... 

And now we’ve done a full 180 and she can’t stand wearing them! Nothing I do keeps them on, I’ve gotten dozens and dozens of different kinds(zippers, sandals, tennis shoes, flip flops and even shoes with characters on them), tried to tie them on her feet, Velcroed them differently and no luck. She seems to just want to run free, but with summer I’m afraid she’s going to get stung by a bee or hurt her feet!

ButteryCrumpetz,2021-04-21 14:46:54+00:00,17 month old cries if asked to say something,"*please no judgey passive aggressive comments*

He babbles like he’s trying to say sentences and is really vocal otherwise. He understands really really well. 

He doesn’t actually say any words though. He knows what many objects around the house are and understands actions like “can I have a kiss” “can I have a hug” “come here” “wave” “clap hands” and many other things. 

Whenever anyone asks him to say something though, he gets upset and cries about it. For example, “Say Mama” he will cry and looked insulted or annoyed almost so I’ll stop bc I don’t want to annoy him further.

Should I be concerned? Is this normal?"
bombsquadreject03,2021-04-21 14:45:05+00:00,My friend hits her kids,"My best friend of over 10 years is, like me, a mother of two children, roughly 13 and 10. My children are the same age. We have watched each other raise our children and over the last couple years, I've noticed her hitting the kids more. When I say hit, I mean she will strike them in the head and has hit them in other areas. I don't consider this ""spanking"" I consider it smacking a child in the face and head. When she does this, it is often out of absolute frustration and accompanied by close proximity yelling and criticism. Her partner also hits the children. From what I have observed, the most common reason for hitting them comes from ""back talk"" or unacceptable attitude. 

I do not hit or allow my parents to hit my children. I don't accept hitting in my house, including between the children. I am amazed that this incredible woman and my friend would be hitting her children like this but her stance is that she can ""parent how she wants, and I can parent how I want"". 

I thought we (as society) agreed that hitting children was bad and often a secret occurrence that people didn't do in front of other people. Is this still considered an acceptable form of discipline for some people? Am I over-reacting? 

Thanks for reading."

And what did she want?  She hit me with a book.  ""Read!"" she says.  Sometimes it's the same book multiple times. I ask her if she wants to read another, and she actually brings the current book to the shelf and grabs a different one.  Since she has my attention, she hands me the book, grabs a blanket and curls up in my lap, and commands me to ""Read!""  
Four books read at least twice later, she's ready to sleep."

We went to the dr and she gave us some ointment but said it probably wasn’t working because it’s a viral infection causing it. The whites of her eyes are not red but the eye is swollen and the past 13 days it is consistently gunked up.

bartdidit,2021-04-21 14:20:27+00:00,Nap skipping with me 2.5 year old,"My son's schedule used to be like clockwork. He always naps around 1-1:30 pm to 3-3:30 pm. He naps a minimum of 2 hours, and sometimes even more (we would wake him up) 

For the past 3 weeks, he started to skip naps. Our routine didnt change at all but he started to play in his bed refusing to sleep. I would say he is napping 3 to 4 times a week max. If we went to the beach or had a physical activity in the weekend before his nap time, he would sleep with no problems. 

He did skip naps before but that would be no more than 5 times a month (when he wakes up late in the morning) 

We have no problem to stop his nap, the problem is that he gets really cranky starting 3 pm and becomes very moody and overtired. He refuses to be put in bed around this time which makes is hard for us. We tried pushing his nap to 2pm without any success.  Today he woke up at 6:15, went to the daycare and refused to nap.

anonymous_female10,2021-04-21 13:33:22+00:00,How independent is your almost 11 year old? Thoughts?,"This may be long. Buckle up as opinions are GREATLY needed and martial issues are coming of it. I am a stay-at-home mom. My 10 (almost 11) year old was struggling in school since Kindergarten. He was more immature than the other students as he started school early. We finally discovered he has ADHD like his father. We held him back his 4th grade year which was this year, got an IEP,  and tried medication. It has done WONDERS. He is now making all A's and B's and has matured so much this year. He has also became a little more independent this year. He wakes himself up (I am also up but do not have to wake him up), brushes his teeth, let's the dogs out to potty, grabs his breakfast, and gets them water while I do my own morning routine and feed the dogs. He is online learning because of covid and goes straight to class on time and switches classes on schedule. He may need an occassional reminder but other than that does it on his own. After school he goes straight to do his chores, does an hour of active activity, has dinner, does homework, then get xbox time before bath and bed. He is also on a billiards team with his dad, grandmother, and her SO which is every Sunday.

It is very peaceful and any arguments or disagreements with him between us is rare. Now he is still a child so occasionally if there needs to be a punishment (lose of xbox time) he will of course be upset. But his upset is never temper tantrums, screaming, or anything of the sort. Just 10 minutes of pouting and silent tears then he is back to normal. But my mother in law (which is now seeping into my husband so we are having martial clashes) is soooo upset, obsessed, and concerned about it. Why? I am not sure. She seems to have a problem that I am not heavily monitoring him during school hours though he is making great grades, has been complimented by all his teachers, and is doing great at his schedule. When she has needed to watch him she will listen and sit and criticize EVERY SINGLE THING HE DOES. His handwriting. His participation in class. How he does his work. She also says I act more as his friend than parent. Why? Because I do not have to be down his throat every waking minute? Everything he does is wrong to her. If he talks he needs to stop butting in adult convos. If he doesn't she is offended and complaining he isn't present. Even though he only gets a set amount of xbox time which he earns it kills her that he gets to play and says he plays too much but then she also says he needs it for stress relief. Complains he doesn't play outside enough. We live in a neighborhood with all elderly and he is an only child along with we can't just have play dates or play with random kids because WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC.

It has gotten to where I can't stand to be around her (I have to be 1-3 times a week) because all she does is complain and put him down which now my husband has started doing. He knit picks him and will start conflict for no reason. They say he will be out of control by the time he is a teenager because ""he is too independent and thinks he is the boss."" What? He doesn't do anything he is not supposed to, asks permission for everything, has never been violent or aggressive to any adult or child, he is very sensitive and cares about others feelings, and is responsible for his age but will be out of control? My husband and I are now at odds and are having major arguments over parenting which was never a problem until he became close with his mother. Who was out of half of his life after she abandoned her 2 kids for drugs. Ironic huh? To be fair she is now I believe 9 years sober but missed from I believe when he was 15 up until about 2 or 3 years ago. He almost 30."
FortuneAndFae,2021-04-21 13:09:37+00:00,My 5 yo is having irrational fears while granddad is dying of cancer.,"My 5 year old boy is all around a great kid. We rarely ever have a behavioral issue. He is confident, makes friends easily, loves playing on his baseball team, and loves reading together. We have a very loving family. All four grandparents and his aunts and uncles adore him. We are very close, but especially close with my in-laws. They live down the road 2 minutes and we usually see them at least 3-5 times a week. They spend a lot of time with my son and they’re great people.

Like everyone else in 2020, my son experienced some pretty significant life changes. He was in a 2-day a week preschool program that ended abruptly with covid. Two family pets died. We were hit by a tornado that damaged our family business pretty badly and damaged some trees in our yard. My MIL got skin cancer on her face and had to go through radiation. My in-laws both got covid and my FIL ended up in the ICU very close to death.Then about a month after being released from the hospital, my FIL was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the end of the year, we found out that I am pregnant and we will get to have another baby this summer. 

So, yeah, lots of big changes and confusing things happening, not to mention covid in general. Socially distancing from friends, our local parks were closed all last spring and summer, and mask-wearing are all strange things for any kid.

We navigated as best as we could. I read lots of parenting articles, books and magazines. We were gently honest with our son about everything that was happening and made sure that he understood that he has a huge support system. We reassured him that he has a big family and we all love him very much. We used clear language to explain granddads cancer. 

Cancer and chemo changed my FIL completely, and changed our entire family. My FIL has been miserably sick and uncharacteristically frightened. He was a very very active man in our community, always busy. After cancer he stayed in his room almost all the time. He became scared to be alone, so my MIL had to stay with him all the time. This meant wayyyy less time with my son, way less family dinners, and my son has been disappointed that granddad can’t play anymore. We’ve adapted the best we can. We have spent more time with friends and my parents to try to make up for losing so much time with my in-laws. And my in-laws are careful to avoid being grim when my son is there, and try to have fun and focus on only him.

About 4 weeks ago we found out FILs chemo is no longer working. He made the decision to end treatment, which of course absolutely broke our hearts but we understand. Pretty quickly his pain became unbearable and his hospice nurses have had to increase his medicine. The last few weeks he has mostly been in bed, sleeping or very groggy and incoherent. We explained to my son that granddads chemo wasn’t working anymore. With lots of other cancers chemo can get rid of the cancer, but granddads cancer is different and the chemo can’t make him better. We explained he is in pain meds and that’s why he talks funny.

All of a sudden, about the same time the chemo stopped working, my son developed some irrational fears. We had a bad thunderstorm one night with tornado warnings. That reminded him of the tornado we had last year. He started to get so worried all of a sudden that we would get another tornado that he will panic if he sees a dark cloud. He will wake up in the middle of the night in tears and he insists I check the weather. He checks the weather radar on my phone several times a day. He keeps asking me to tell him we will never have a tornado, which I can’t because that would be a lie. I finally calmed those fears a bit by explaining that we don’t typically get BAD tornadoes in our area, just small tornadoes that damage trees. Maybe a tiny bit of a lie because about once every 5-10 years we have a pretty bad one.

Then he started on the lights. We had a string of globe lights upstairs in our house and I noticed one day after they’d been left on for a few days that they were a little hot. So I unplugged them and mentioned something about it to my husband. Our son overheard and came to the conclusion that any of the lights in our house can cause a fire. We threw away the string of lights, but that wasn’t enough. Now he will wake up on the middle of the night and cry, worried that a light is on somewhere in the house. He will panic at bedtime and insist we turn off every single light before he goes to bed.

I can’t help but think that these new irrational fears are connected to his granddad dying. We haven’t actually told him that granddad is going to die yet. We have been trying to deliver the bad news by degrees. Now I’m afraid when we DO tell him, he will start to fixate on sickness like he has fixated on tornadoes and fires. I check in with him often and ask him if he wants to talk about granddad or anything else. We will sometimes show emotion in front of him, but we try to keep from really dwelling on what’s happening so that we can laugh and have fun without it seeming forced to him. 

I’m not sure if we are doing something wrong. Should I explain to him now that granddad is dying, and redirect his fears to what might really be causing them? Or is it possible that his new fears have nothing to do with granddad? Maybe I’ve made his fears worse by listening to them and treating them seriously instead of “nipping them in the bud”?

I am looking for a counselor in our area to help. I am afraid if we start counseling it will blow things more out of proportion but I also don’t want his fears to escalate any further. Until we find a counselor to get in with I would like to make sure we don’t make things any worse. 

Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated."
PepperAlternative905,2021-04-21 13:03:46+00:00,"DH wants son to go to Preschool, I want him to wait","My son is 3.5, and in our area, we send them to preschool ages 3 &amp; 4. He has a winter birthday, so he missed the cutoff last year - this would he his first year to go. My husband is ADAMANT that my son go this fall, and I am just not on board. Husband's reasoning to send him just consist of ""It's time,"" ""He's ready,"" or ""He needs to go.""

I want to start by saying this has nothing to do with me being super attached and not wanting my baby to leave. I love my baby boy, but I'm just not that kind of clingy mom. Lol. I feel like I have practical reasons... 

First off, he is not potty trained. This has been a HUGE HUGE battle with him and we have tried several times, several different ways, with no success yet. I am hoping to get this resolved this summer though, fingers crossed.  Second, we are still under mask requirements where we are and my son just will not wear one. That is mostly my fault - I am a SAHM, and spent most of 2020 pregnant, so we didn't go anywhere pretty much all last year, so he didn't really have time or need to get used to it. Third, I have received several comments from a variety of LEGITIMATE sources (i.e. pediatrician) that he is of above average in terms of intellectual development. I have tried very hard to constantly work with him to make sure he has a head start for when his schooling would start. Lastly, like I said, I am a SAHM, so it's not like we would need to send him for financial reasons to get out of having to pay for daycare, or send him because we need to find somewhere for him to be during the day.

Now, I 100% see the benefits of sending him to preschool, for learning and for socialization. I DO believe it is important to send him. And if the world were ""normal"" right now, I would have 0 issues with sending him, even not potty trained! But that's just not the case. I would prefer to wait a year, for him to go when he is 4 and get 1 year instead of 2. Who knows where we will be in a year? Hopefully better than now. But if things aren't different by then, I will begrudgingly let him go, anyway. By then he will hopefully be able to understand better the need for a mask and will be able to use the potty. But I just don't  see why it is so dang important to send him this year. 

To make matters worse, my SIL (Husband's Sister) is a teacher, and she just keeps repeating over and over  about how he needs to go, and that just fuels my husband's fire. But she doesn't have kids! She just doesn't get what it's like to worry like a mother. Lol. 

So, am I being unreasonable for not wanting to send him now, or do you feel that my points are valid?"

First time dad here. Wondering if someone can shed light onto a question we are having. 

Our firstborn was born on X-mas day, so is nearing the 4 month mark. So far he has been exclusively breast fed, and minus some early teething pains a pleasure. He rarely cries or makes a fuss.

Recently, since last Sunday he has started to really shout. his cooing was always so quite and now he shouts 'AHH' at first we thought maybe he is finding his voice. But we also realized he hasn't pooed in 10 Days. We know babies don't poo as often while being breastfed, but Charlie usually goes every 6 days... Day 7 was when he started shouting.

I just wanted to know if we should be worried or do anything? I don't want to be a overconcerned parent, as everywhere says don't worry as he is breastfed, they don't get constipated. And honestly he seems fine in himself. he is happy, sleeping well, seems to be eating. wees regularly etc. But we also don't want to brush it under the rug and ignore it if it is a problem (or if ignored could become one later down the line) 

Anyway, thanks for you help all :)"

But ever since I was pregnant I cry very often now. At least once a week. I'd say probably 3x a week lol. I'm not depressed (I know how that feels) and the boys are 20 months old now, so it's not a post partum thing. Has pregnancy just changed me?

Flocculencio,2021-04-21 11:14:02+00:00,"6 year old says ""I'm annoying but I don't know why""","He's in the first year of Primary school and has been generally enjoying it.

The kids he plays with in our neighborhood playground after school (some, not all, are from the same school) also apparently say he's annoying and from what I've seen do keep excluding him. 

The trouble is that I can see why they might feel this- kid tends to be very loudly opinionated and gets fixed on specific ideas but at the same time isn't very good at getting other kids to follow along. Simultaneously he craves approval from them so isn't the type who can shrug off kids not wanting to do his thing and just follow along with theirs.

MadMads1122,2021-04-21 10:47:09+00:00,Daycare mood swings and interrupted sleep - 18mo,"Hello! My daughter has very recently started daycare. She is 18 months old, and appears to very much enjoy herself while at the facility. No tears, eats well, fights naptime a little but still sleeps during her regular naptime that she had at home as well. When I pick her up at the end of the day, she immediately bursts into tears and clings to me. She is happy and talkative for the ride home, and then is a spiraling ball of temper tantrums for the remainder of the evening. She also started waking up multiple times during the night - just needing a quick snuggle before going back to bed. 

The broken nighttime sleep could definitely be a minor sleep regression, which I anticipated at this age. The temper tantrums and lack of play at home are what's concerning me most. Has anyone else experienced a shift in their child's mood after joining a daycare?"

It cannot be sickness related because of you know, Covid. They are not ballbusters about these things, so I’m not too worried. But since covid, I dont wanna take a chance that they would ask for a paper proof (like saying its their appointment for the dentist). What would be a good excuse?

She isn’t quite old enough to fully understand directions so I don’t even know how to communicate certain things to her. She does spend time with other babies (whom she loves, she’s very extroverted and loves people) so I know that she might not initially hate the baby. But with this she also is very very attention wanting. She loves to be snuggled, held, etc. I’m getting nervous as my due date approaches on how I’ll be able to parent two babies when my oldest is already a lot to handle. She’s high energy and loves to play and run around. I’ll be by myself most of the time so I’ll have to care for two small children while healing post partum. Any advice or tips from others who had children similarly distanced?"

RufTed28,2021-04-21 07:02:26+00:00,Baby rarely engages with us,"My 11, nearly 12 week old baby rarely engages with us. It was identified at his 8 week GP developmental check that he still wasn't social smiling. He finally smiled at around 10 weeks, however he only really smiles at us perhaps once every few days and it's very hit and miss.

He also rarely makes eye contact with us, and will go out of his way to avoid looking at us (if we move to be in his eye line he will quickly move away). He's fascinated by the walls/ceiling/pictures on the walls/inside cover of his pram and will give them lovely smiles.

He similarly doesn't track us/objects of interest with his eyes very well; about 90% of the time when we try to encourage this he's staring off into the distance. He doesn't look at us when we come into the room, and shows little interest in anything we show him- he just stares past it instead.

He passed his newborn hearing test, and passed the eye checks at the development check up.

My GP has now referred him to a pediatrician and I can't stop worrying and feeling upset about it; sure that it means he's got autism. I know they can't test for this until much later on, but the anxiety is really getting to me. My health visitor isn't interested and keeps just saying nothing can be done about it. Due to covid I've missed out on meeting parents with babies the same age as mine, so can't really make a comparison to see how their babies are interacting.

winnietheprincess,2021-04-21 06:33:27+00:00,What day is it?,"My husband and I welcomed our first child on April 2nd,  he is now 2 almost 3 weeks old and I am stupid in love with him. 
I am exclusively breastfeeding and this means I am up at least every 2 hours (3 if I get lucky) if I sleep at all. On top of this, he screams anytime my husband holds him, and instantly calms once I hold him again. 
The entire 2 weeks he has had 0 issues sleeping in his bassinet...up until 2 days ago. He must be held whilehe sleeps...and by only me. So little dude and I have shacked up in the recliner in our living room. 
But I am frigging exhausted. 
It's impossible to sleep in fear of something happening to him, a blanket creeping over his face, him falling. 
And my husband....he peacefully sleeps. Stretched out, no cramped arms, comfy. 
Don't get me wrong I love baby cuddles, but omg I miss my bed. 
I haven't slept in 24 hours and hubby is sleeping on the couch en route to his 8 hours. I guess he felt bad I haven't been able to sleep in our bedroom, but honestly seeing him sleep while I've got none is just making me so jealous/angry/grrrrr.
If he was in our bedroom I'd at least not have my face rubbed into it. I know his intentions are good but I'm losing it!!
I also know it isn't his fault our son is very clingy towards me, but I'd kill for a break like he gets. I really just needed to vent cause its no use to be upset at him for things out of his control. And it's useless for both of us to be totally sleep deprived and miserable."
katt_atonic,2021-04-21 06:03:02+00:00,10 year old boy with many issues...,"So my stepson has massive issues. 

This week alone, he was late to school and had to come home (walks to school), forgot his homework, left my car door open and completely ruined my passenger seat and carpet (it rained overnight), threw a glass bottle and broke a 4K 65 inch smart tv, forgets or refuses to shower and brush his teeth, constantly loses things, etc. 

This is his typical behavior- low to no impulse control, and zero attentiveness. He also has very few friends at school. 

Also of concern, we bought him a new puppy, which is 2 months old- the puppy is constantly running under our feet and I accidentally stepped on him, making him yelp in pain for a minute. He started cracking up with laughter.

He will show some remorse, but any talking to goes in one ear and out the other. He can be a good kid but he obviously had lots of issues. Would a child psychologist be rational here? Any tips?"
Linorelai,2021-04-21 06:02:01+00:00,How to get the baby to sleep with his hands free?,"Ok, here is the problem.

My 6 m.o. baby sleeps in a sleeping bag (idk if this is what you call it in English, it's a height-length fabric bag with a zipper)

Without it he used to wake himself up with his hands, and with regular swadding he used to uncover himself, free his hands and again, wake himself up. So I thought, this was a solution - he can move, but can't reach the face.

But now, that he doesn't have the moreau reflex, I thought I could put him to bed unbagged. The most common advice is to start teaching the unswadded sleep with letting one hand out. 

If i put him already sleeping, he reaches his face, rubs it, puts his hand in his mouth, and wakes up. 

And if I put him sleepy, ready to black out, he again wakes up immediately and starts to actively play with the blanket, with his clothes, with the wall of the crib, with everything around him. And no matter how sleepy he was, it's an instant switch on to play mode.

I tryed to lay my hand on his chest to hold his hand until he's asleep, but he protests.

So it's either a protesting cry if I hold him, or an active play if I don't.

I've been adviced to let him play to discover the crib, so that it wasn't new for him and he'd stop being so enthusiastic. But it contradicts another common advice to keep the bed exclusively for sleeping, and not for playing, so that there wasn't an association bed=play. 

Any ideas? What do I do?

I am letting him explore rn. Hope, it's not a mistake..."
MaslerB,2021-04-21 05:03:29+00:00,Six year and school anxiety,"Monday morning my 6 year old (first grader) had a rough morning upon arriving at school. He told my wife he hated himself and slapped himself in the head a couple times. Then refused to get out of the car while crying. He is usually the tough type, hardly ever crying. 

I spoke to him after school and he did admit a kid had been rougly shoving past him and telling him to get out of his way while in the halls. Though he said he wasn't scared of the kid he was reluctant to tell me. We've spoken to his teacher about this and action has been taken thus far.

He had a better morning Tuesday but still showed reluctance. He is his normal self while at home which ranges from hyper/goofy to stubborn/stoic (he's our stubborn one). 

He keeps asking for a break from school. This is where my wife and I seem to be at odds. She wants to give him the break while I do not. I understand her perspective but I do not want to keep him home and then have a full blown meltdown when it's time to return. At a risk of sounding cold, our kids have the afternoons (with no homework right now) and weekends as their break from school and I find school important for social development and forming routines.

Overall I'm worried for him and just want to help and understand. I don't really know what to do as we haven't faced this situation as parents so I'd like constructive responses rather than bashing ones. We're doing our best to help him as we want nothing but the best for all of our children but any advice or relatable experiences would be greatly appreciated."

Story of the day, I posted in r/Nanny an experience that I needed help on, which led me to have to explain the mom I was Nannying for had an OnlyFans lifestyle, yep, lifestyle - meaning it wasn't an under the rug type thing, it was really all she did. (The bigger issue was that she was actually taking advantage of me, gaslighting me, and only paying me $3 an hour so the OnlyFans was just a COMMENT I made) I was immediately attacked in the comments for ""judging her line of work."" because sex-work is real work, apparently.

I mean, I'm all for opinions and accepting human beings are sacred, important spirits of life but that doesn't mean I am going to admit to something I don't believe in. They tried silencing my opinion on the matter, I responded saying well, it's my opinion, OnlyFans is pure prostitution. 

I immediately got banned - Perma banned from r/Nanny literally forever. No insults, no arguing, just a few replies back and forth of me referring to OnlyFans that way. 

I wanted to see what you all had to say about this. As parents do you guys see OnlyFans as real work? Is that something you would judge somebody for in the same instance I did?"
Cealdi,2021-04-21 04:47:16+00:00,A small rave - our 4 year old made some good choices all on her own today!,"Our poor little one hasn't had much contact with other kids since the pandemic began (she had a life threatening immune reaction to another virus at 2 so we've been very cautious) so whenever she gets a chance to play with other kids, she's very excited. 

Earlier, she, her older sister, and I were at the mall and there is an outdoor dining area at this particular mall with games people can play (giant chessboard and pieces, cornhole, ping pong, etc.) and there were a couple of other masked kids her age playing so after she finished her dinner I told her to mask up and that she could join them for a bit. She was thrilled to get to run around with them and jumped right into whatever game they were playing, but pretty soon, one of them led the others to the chessboard and they all began violently kicking the chess pieces around. Some of them were breaking apart, and I watched LO to see what she'd do. Without even looking to us for direction or anything, she took a step back and crossed her arms and just stayed completely out of it. When they didn't stop after a few seconds, she ran back to join us and told us she didn't like that game because 'it's not nice'. I was so proud of her!! And then a minute or two later one of the other kids' parents broke it up and they were all back to playing again when two of them decided that flinging cornhole sandbags and random adults was a good idea. Again, LO refused to participate, even when they stuffed one into her hand and directed her to throw it at people. Instead, she just started trying to make it into the hole by herself. 

Sometimes you wonder if anything you're trying to teach your kid is sinking in, and it's just really nice to actually see that it is. Even her big sister, who is rarely impressed with much (it's the age...lol) was like, ""Wow, she's such a *good* girl. Look at that."" Lol"

No potatoes (and I mixed them with gravy, butter, and milk, to see if he’d like the combination of any of them with potatoes). We tried mashed carrots, and he loves the puréed carrots, and still nothing. I’ve offered peas, which he also liked, and no dice. We tried Mac n cheese with the pasta cut up all teeny and no, we tried pasta with tomato sauce and nothing. He likes bananas but doesn’t pick them up to chew it, he just lips it like one would an ice cream or an ice pop. They say you gotta keep offering and still nothing. He doesn’t like teethers or puffs or Cheerios. We plan to try avocado and honey nut Cheerios tomorrow but this is our last hope and we even made an appointment for a behavioural specialist l. He will chew on anything, even people, yet I can’t get him to chew on food. I’m at wits end. He can’t stay on baby food, but I also can’t starve him until he decides to eat real food. I’m at a loss for what to do. How does one teach their child to chew?! He’s got the moving food in his mouth down, but he tries to swallow everything whole, and when it don’t work he gags it up, mashes it in his mouth and does what I assume is chewing, then swallows but he gets so scared to take another bite and after about 3 he stops completely."

She has two older children with no concerns but not only does this 2 1/2 year-old have severe speech delay (he only says one word, doesn’t link 2 together and can’t pronounce any words correctly ie da for dog, ba for brother, mo for mum), for which she is getting speech therapy. He also can’t follow two-step instructions. Can’t even follow a one step instruction without extra support. He has a very short neck and a very large head. I work in healthcare and have friends work in healthcare and two of my friends within minutes of seeing my sister’s toddler turned to me and said what is wrong with her child? 
My sister saw a paediatrician once over a year ago about the large head and the paediatrician said just to monitor it. But as he becomes older it’s clear there are more concerned than just a language delay. My sister however is extra extra sensitive and while my mum is now very concerned as well (she looks after him 1 day a week) no one knows how to raise this with my sister. 

She has never had a child and family health check up with him (which is what we use in Australia to monitor growth and development) and is having her first one next month but I am concerned it might not be picked up in that 30 minute appointment?"

The kids are pretty different in age (14 and 8) so  we haven’t had many opportunities to really dig into something as the four of us. The teen always wants to go chat with friends and the younger one has hobbies that (understandably) don’t interest the teen.

We’re trying to think up some fun things the whole family can enjoy, but are finding it difficult with the age gap. 

So far what we’ve found successful is going to the pool at the Y, doing a make your own pizza night, and playing some board games. But thats about it, we’ve run out of ideas that both kids can get into.

I have a beautiful almost 18 month old daughter. I just found out I’m pregnant tonight (I believe about 7-8 weeks). This was a huge shock because I had a period about a month ago but perhaps it was implantation bleeding. My husband and I both think that terminating the pregnancy is the best decision. He works out of town a lot, and it’s very hard on me already managing everything on my own. I don’t know how we would manage a baby and a toddler this close in age. My husbands job is very demanding and he wouldn’t be able to help me much. We also live in a 2 bedroom apartment. The guilt I fucking feel about terminating is already eating me alive. I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve been conditioned to feel this way, but also because I feel awful about not giving my daughter a sibling (we were planning 4 years apart). We can provide well financially and emotionally for our daughter but I don’t think we can right now for a second. I feel lucky to live in a progressive state where I have a choice.

One of my girls has a harder time going to sleep, though, and she’ll keep the other one awake. I’ve noticed a (natural) correlation between the light being on or off changing just how soon they fall asleep. 

That said, I’m looking for a nightlight for them that can lighten up the room enough to read by, but that ever so slowly dims away into a tiny ember or just nothingness according to a timer I can set. I think if I had a way to slowly take the light away like that, where they barely notice it getting darker and darker, I would see an increase in earlier bedtimes.

This was the only time in my adult life I had been struck by either one of my parents. When went to hit me again, I caught her hand (it was a reflex) and said something along the lines of ""I am an adult, you do not get to hit me"", and walked away. That was almost 3 years ago, and my mom and I never talked about that night. It came to my attention recently that my mom was furious at me for that night. She claimed that I ""raised my hand against her"" by blocking her hits, and told my father that she never thought she would feel the need to DEFEND herself from what of her children. To top it all off, my brother was chewing me out saying that I should have just taken the hits ""like a man"", and gave me a lecture that basically amounted to ""she was wrong to hit you, but you were more wrong for not taking it, and since she's my mom, I have to deal with it"".

Today when I picked my son up from school she said they were playing ( my son and this boy) and my son was growling at him while they were playing monsters. The little boy told him to stop and my son kept growling. So the little boy pushed and kicked him. They were separated and made to listen to books about not hitting. 
The teacher told me the first time we talked she wasn’t there but this boy likes to play”big and loud” and it was probably accidental. But today she made it seem like my son provoked him, but regardless hitting and kicking isn’t ok. So which is it? He likes to play big and loud or he’s an aggressive kid. 🤔
I told my son to listen when people say stop and to find another friend to play with. I also explained it’s never ok to be hit or to hit. 

 Do you think this younger kid is a bully? This happened 2 times in three days. My son has a sizable laceration on his ankle. 
Is this developmentally appropriate? Is there anything else I should do? Is the school handling this well?"

dkeethler,2021-04-21 01:11:34+00:00,PLEASE HELP - Daughter won't let me leave her room at bedtime,"My daughter (4yr) is throwing an absolute tantrum at bedtime when I try to leave her room. My wife does bath time and jammies, and I do bedtime.

Our routine is 2 books and some snuggle time. This takes about 15-20 minutes. My goal is to leave before she falls asleep so that she is not dependent on one of us laying with her in order to sleep.  But...

I lay with her for 5-10 minutes before I start to get up. Then she starts screaming, kicking, hitting, throwing things, causing damage, etc.  The only way I can leave is if she's asleep...and I ain't havin' that.  She makes me feel like a hostage in her room.

We have tried:

The physically put them back each time while calmly saying ""it's your bedtime, you need to stay in bed"" method,

The lay there as long as you need to (sometimes up to an hour),

Bribes,

Taking things away,

Spanking,


This is all happening with our 10 month old son trying to sleep in the next room.  We can't get a word in; she doesn't stop saying ""no"" or some other phrase even enough to hear what we have to say.  We are literally at a loss and we dread 8pm every day. In my opinion we've tried everything. I may have missed something we've tried so if anyone has ANY ideas, please, for the love of God, let me know.

Thank you."

sandman2591,2021-04-21 00:39:58+00:00,I just want to know if I really am a unfit father?,"Married a few years and we have a beautiful healthy 6 month old. This is our first child so we are defiantly experiencing/learning a lot. Today we got into a huge fight and she told me she does not trust me alone with the baby anymore. For the past 7 weeks my wife has been In school and I have been taking care of the baby from 730am-5pm. Never had a issue and as time went on I got better and better at being a father. I’m super grateful for the time I get to spend with my baby boy. Today when my wife came home everything was all good but I was a little tired and took a nap with the baby. My wife goes to Zumba on Tuesdays. Today bc I napped I didn’t get to take the dog on his afternoon walk when she gets home. When I woke up from my nap the baby was still sleeping and my wife has left for Zumba. The dog started whining that he had to go out since he hasn’t used the bathroom in 12 hours. So I put our sleeping baby in his empty crib and was planning on stepping outside with the dog just so he can pee and run back inside. He has a fully breathable mattress, the crib is empty and I had the baby monitor on him so I can watch when as I stepped out for 2 minutes. I then called my wife to ask where did she put the leash and when she found out what I was about to do she exploded on me. She was telling me how irresponsible I am, and how I’m making a massive mistake. Wtf is wrong with me for even consider doing something so reckless like that. So I began to tell her what am I suppose to do? He’s fully safe and I’m watching him. I then told her there is no difference if I had to use the bathroom or wanted to shower with him sleeping. His stroller is in her car so she made me put him in his car seat and I went out and carried him with me while I let the dog use the bathroom. She then begin to tell me that she doesn’t trust me with the baby alone anymore after trying to do something that crazy. And then she recommended that when she’s not home that my mother should come and help watch our baby until she gets home. This is when we get into a massive fight bc I feel extremely disrespected. I have been watching our alone for over 7 weeks, I do it all. Feed him change him play with him give him baths and she is now telling me that I need a supervisor to watch our child. After a bunch of back and forth I told her I do not want to fight anymore let’s just agree to disagree. She then said do I really see nothing wrong with what I did and I said no. I did tell her I will not do that ever again bc it worries her but I think she is way over exaggerating. For all the parents out there is this really that dangerous and reckless to do? I would never ever want to put my baby in any kind of danger but I don’t think it’s that insane with what o wanted to do. I was in and out of the house in 5 minutes or less. Any advice would be greatly appreciated"

mobmuS-buwmex7-,2021-04-21 00:37:12+00:00,Wife said she hates our (maybe) Autistic son,"My son(almost 3) is about to begin the diagnostic process for Autism and my wife is losing it fast. He seemed like a relatively normal developing child with a few quirks here and there, but a recent visit to the pediatrician has caused a massive change in my wife’s approach to him. She is constantly researching Autism topics, attempting to confirm his diagnosis herself, constantly crying, and talking about every negative that could ever possibly be (he will never have friends, go to prom, go fishing, play sports, he will never be potty trained, tell us if he is sick, we will have to care for him until we die, etc). The list goes on and on. I just don’t know how much more I can handle. She refuses to talk to anyone about it. Says it will not do any bit of good. 

The worst is nap or bedtime. He is not fussy but will just lay in his crib for hours wide awake in a pitch black room. She just stares at the monitor and gets so angry. Constantly yelling at him to leave his blanket alone, close his eyes, take your feet off the bars, etc. it has to be causing him more anxiety than anything. We have tried melatonin and it seems like it makes him more hyped. He will eventually fall asleep (at night) but will often wake up from midnight to around 4 am. She can hear him in the monitor and will just start crying in the middle of the night. I am a heavy sleeper and she will often wake me just to complain or stress over it. I do understand because if he doesn’t sleep, his behavior the next day is subpar at best. I do have to work though, so I often get upset with her as well, because there is nothing she or I can really do about it. He is safe in his crib but just awake. I tell her to turn off the monitor but she refuses to do so. She said she needs to know what he is doing, so she can tell the doctors. 

Any meal time is an adventure because he has some sensory issues. Refuses to use a fork or spoon. Often gags on certain textures and will vomit. Easily distracted by most anything. Most meals take 45 min minimum. She constantly yells at him to eat. Complains that she can’t make him anything, and gets pissed at me when I tell her to calm down.

She is always criticizing me for how I am with him. Says I am not consistent and that he acts different with me. I’ll be honest, I do parent differently than her but I try to be consistent with him. Especially at bedtime. However I may not put his shirt and pants on in the same order she does or I may not discipline him the way she feels is appropriate, but he always eats around the same time, gets put down for a nap at the same time, and has the same bedtime routine at the same time.

She has said that she would be better off dead, that it would be easier if he was completely handicapped, and that this is the worst case scenario. I have told her if she doesn’t want this for her life, she can leave. I am not holding her hostage. But that just pisses her off more. I don’t want her to, nor do I want to leave but I really don’t know how much more I can take. I can’t stand all of the negativity, the yelling, the complaining. I want to be able to help her but she refuses anything I try to offer. She thinks I don’t care because I don’t have the same level of anxiety she does, but that is simply not true. I just manage it very differently.

Our marriage is not healthy and probably wasn’t before he was born. However none of this is his fault, and I feel like hates him more and more each day. Apologies for the vent session, I just really don’t know what to do or how to handle all of this."

Both my husband and I already had fifth's as a kid, so we aren't worried about catching it.

hangryhangryhipp0,2021-04-21 00:31:21+00:00,Angry child after surgery,"I had a major surgery a week ago and have activity restrictions for six weeks. I cannot lift, push, pull, etc. 

I prepared my 4 year old on an age appropriate level before this happened, and thought it would go pretty smoothly. He goes to school during the day time, and his dad is helping do all the things I normally do (morning routine, most of bedtime routine) while I heal. 

However, my child is...struggling. He seems to be angry. He tells me he hates me, says he wants to get rid of me, wants me pushed down the stairs. 

He is still very sweet sometimes, and tells me he loves me, will read with me. But he just goes off the chain. Today he wanted to watch tv after school. We agreed that he could watch one 5 minute show but that is all because then it will be dinner time. He agreed, but after he got upset we couldn’t watch another. That is normal,  but then he started hitting and kicking at me. At bedtime, he got mad that we wouldn’t let him jump off his bed and started trying to intentionally jump at me and try to push me over. 

Normally if he gets upset, I can talk to him and validate his feelings and redirect him, but those things aren’t working right now. Typically if he’s hitting I’m able to tell him I can’t let him hit and will hold him in my lap and hold his hands while I talk to him and help him calm down, but I can’t right now with my surgical wounds so fresh. 

I’ve tried to give extra praise for anything kind and helpful he’s doing or saying. I’ve even tried getting some toys from the store and if he can make it a full day with good listening and being kind and respectful. I’m completely at a loss. 

Please, any advice or suggestions will be helpful. Thank you!"

KeyOfGSharp,2021-04-21 00:01:41+00:00,My son (3yrs) won't stop pushing his sister (1yr).,"First and foremost, we are against hitting kids.

Now, sometimes my son will share things with his sister, and say 'here you go!' and so we shower him with praises. We really drive home the fact that what he did was good.

But sometimes, he'll see his sister and then I can see a devilish look in his eye. Now, I can a lot of the time beat him to it and tell him not to do it before he does, and he does listen.

But it's when I'm too late where things get dramatic.

If his hands are even on her it's too late. No matter how soft, or loud I try to be to either get his attention or divert him he just follows through. Then I get angry, she starts crying, and I try to explain to him that he hurt her.

I'll put him in his room and explain to him what he did and why it was wrong and then shut the door. (This definitely upsets him)

After a few minutes, I open the door (sometimes he's still upset but sometimes not) and I REITERATE what and why he did wrong. I hug him and make him apologize to his sister.

All seems pretty textbook right? I swear I'm not half-assing any advice given. But nothing quite seems to work.

Any ideas?"

Mephistophrina,2021-04-20 23:45:37+00:00,Preschool help,"My daughter (4yo) started preschool three months ago and adjusted really well. She would run off as soon as she got there to play with her friends and we never had a problem. My six year old just got accepted into a school we’ve been on a waiting list for and they run a preschool program. I decided to move my daughter to that preschool so I can drop them off together and then she will be already enrolled for kindergarten next year. Also her old preschool is too far away from my sons new school to manage drop offs and pick ups at different schools.

Well today was her third day at the new preschool and the drop offs have gotten progressively worse to the point I would say today felt traumatic. I don’t know how either of us is supposed to be able to go through with this every time. She was screaming before we even got out of the car, cried the whole way walking through the school to drop off her brother, and then once we got to her class she was screaming the most guttural scream I have ever heard come from her and just kept saying “I’m scared I’m scared” over and over clinging to me. The teacher gave us a minute for me to try to calm her but as soon as I was about to leave she started again. The teacher had to physically pull her off me and restrain her so I could get out the gate and then I saw my daughter thrash on to the ground and continued screaming until I walked far enough away I couldn’t hear her anymore.

I have no idea if this is normal because we never had this happen at the old school. How long should I expect this to last? Is this traumatic to continue doing to her? I’ve honestly never seen her in that state before. I have no idea what to do. It is so much harder because my son loves his new school and it was a lot of work to get him accepted and having them go to separate schools will be too difficult.

Odd-Bodybuilder-1854,2021-04-20 23:22:14+00:00,In Desperate Need of Sanity Check - Is my coparent toxic toward the kids?," 

Hello Reddit Community,

I am crying for help. The issue that I have is that we fundamentally disagree on how we parent the children and I'm afraid that it is straining our relationship. I am asking for comments, advice, and perhaps even relatable stories so that I don't feel so alone.

We have three young children, all under the age of 11 that are approximately 3 years apart each. Two are in ""Zoom School"" right now due to COVID, and for the past 8 years, I have been the sole breadwinner in the house. My job is very demanding and we do not have any secondary sources of income. Since the pandemic started in March 2020, I have been working remotely, and I will soon return to the office. During the past year, I have seen a lot that has had me carefully question my observtions, and sometimes my sanity. No matter how I bring up my concerns about my observations of her parenting, it always turns into a weird moment where she gets defensive and if I decide to stick to my guns and request a serious conversation about my concerns, she will raise her voice until we either fight about it, or I (or she) walks or drives off to avoid another argument.

These are the top issues that I have brought up that I consider very toxic and feel need to change. Reddit, please be my sanity check. Should I be seriously concerned or am I being too sensitive?

1. **YELLING** during Zoom and during homework/schoolwork - Kids are difficult, right? They disobey, they whine and procrastinate, and they sometimes choose noncompliance as a solution to tough moments. My kids are good kids, but they are KIDS. The ones in school have good days and bad days, but all in all, they are really good kids. They are compassionate, they make friends easily, and they love their school. But she yells at them at least once a day while they are doing their schoolwork during any of the above resistance points I described below. I know that her yelling can be abusive because at times she will curse at them and ridicule them if they try and talk back.
2. **Spontaneous punishments -** If one of the kids misses a homework assignment, or gets caught violating a tablet or ""screen time"" curfew, she has historically been inconsistent in matching the punishment to the crime. Sometimes she will not punish for a violation that historically had an extreme punishment - In other words, there's little consistency here. Sometimes, she will dish out an extreme punishment and then tell me about it afterward, instead of allowing us to put our heads together and discuss. Once she barged into my home office while I was on a conference call for work, and as soon as I motioned that ""I was on a call, but it's on mute"" she took it upon herself to vent about what she caught the kid doing (texting over Facebook kids with a family member when she should have been paying attention to zoom class) and that ""she was grounded from chatting and playing video games for three months"" - I told her that now wasn't a good time, and if there's any chance we can discuss before such a harsh punishment is made. While I was on my call (still muted) she made a comment that I am not around so she has to do the parenting... - Um, hello, *I* was working to support the family while you were doing *your* job. This point in particular often gets lost on her in these emotional fits she has. Sometimes I think she takes me for granted, but that's another convo.
3. **Low Boundaries -** when she is not providing oversight to the kids' responsibilities like school and everything is fair weather she often makes, encourages, and laughs at bathroom humor with the kids. Trust me, as a guy who laughs harder at a good fart joke than any type of highbrow humor, I can relate to how funny it is and how it's a great way to win the affection of kids, HOWEVER, as a Dad I cringe because when she does this, I believe that she undermines her authority- so it comes off as very confusing and very Jekyll and Hyde when just two hours before she was yelling at the kids because they were stuck on a math problem and wanting to give up. In addition to undermining her authority, she is also, in my opinion, compromising respect and trust by yelling at the kids all the time.
4. **Complaining about the kids to me when they can hear it -** This is the one that probably triggers me the most because I think it's hurtful to the kids and very disrespectful to me. The most common scene that this happens is when I come into the house for lunch break during a work day or come home for the day. Before even asking me how my day went (which she rarely asks anyways) she will start dumping on me about how ""bad"" the kids were or how ""difficult"" the kids/specific kid was during the day, going into detail that is in my opinion, very hurtful. For example, this is something she would say without constraint on any given day... *""This afternoon, (kid name) was on her stupid video game again when she should have been submitting work. And now she is fucking up her science grade because her test score came in low. If she wasn't always fucking around and doing dumb shit, this wouldn't be so hard""* \- all the while, the kids are literally in the next room and can all hear it. This has to be terrible for a kid's self esteem. It infuriates me and I tell her that it's harmful and abusive to talk like that in front of the kids and she will just get defensive and sometimes turn on me as if I am not trying to consider being a parent. The ironic part is that as a parent, I want to protect the kids this type of behavior which I consider to be highly abusive.
5. Lovebombing at the end of a rough day - after one of these rough days, which average at least 3-4 per week, she hardly apologizes to the kids *but* definitely goes full send on putting on the affection with all of the cuddles, late bedtime cuddle and story/song routines, and sometimes even a last minute decision to ""get takeout because I didn't prepare anything for dinner,"" when in actuality, the afternoon was chaotic, mismanaged, and full of toxic emotion that stood in the way of being productive...(Btw, I'm not trying to assign a gender role of making dinner here, but if I don't get off of work until right before dinner time and she doesn't have a 8-6 job, then, dinner is hers to plan unless she asks for my help well in advance. Period.)

Ok - I am trying to be disciplined enough to keep the list short, so I'll end there. If anyone is even reading this, you may be wondering ""how does she treat you, bro?"" I'll say this, we have had our issues and we have grown a lot over nearly 15 years of marriage. I am trying to figure out how to effectively break through on the above issues. If anyone has experience, advice, or has a simlar situation and finds this relatable, please join the conversation.

Sincerely,

direvus,2021-04-20 23:14:03+00:00,Getting rejected by my kids,"I'm a dad with a toddler coming up on 3 years, and a baby at 8 months.  Right now the baby is going through that ""only mummy"" phase and it sucks.

When she starts screaming in the night (happens 3-10 times a night), and I go in to try to calm her down, her reaction is a full-body furious rejection.  She arches her back and pushes me away with her arms all while screaming like somebody is trying to murder her.  This goes on until my wife shows up, and then she is fine all of a sudden.

It is just the worst.  It kills me right in the feelings.  I feel unloved.  I feel like a failure.  I feel worthless.

My older kid (now a 3 year old) did this same thing for a while at a similar age, and it sucked then too.  I have a pretty good relationship with her now, but in the last few weeks she has regressed and now sometimes she will yell at me ""No Daddy I don't want you I need my mummy!"" and it's like a knife in the guts every time.

Some days I'm getting it from both of them at the same time, so the house is full of screaming and crying, my wife is overloaded and I can't do anything to help.  Those are my least favourite days.

I know that this is a normal phase for kids to go through, and my wife knows that this isn't my fault, but she can't really fully empathise, because she has no idea what this feels like.  I hope she never finds out.  Because it sure does suck absolute balls.

I don't have anything productive to say about this, just wanted to have a rant.  If you made it this far, thanks for listening."

I have absolutely nothing against spending times with my kids, but there needs to be balance. If he is unable to guy outside and shoot hoops on his own, ever...it's a problem.

Anytime we suggest am activity to him, it's ""can you do it with me?"" He acts as though we do nothing together, which couldn't be further from the truth. A conversation at the dinner table just went:

Us: ""Its beautiful out, too bad it's late for a walk.""
Him: ""Could we still go outside, actually I want to play basketball.""
Us: ""Great idea, go ahead.""
Him: ""You guys aren't going to? Then I'm not, nevermind""

He's allergic to being on his own. Deep down I know it's a form of control, and he's been displaying a lot of spoiled behaviors around the house lately. The video games are becoming a problem, but we have failed to find a healthy balance. It seems he can't even get a taste of them without wanting and thinking about them constantly - and I feel like it is contributing to the behavior I'm talking about.

Anytime we suggest am activity to him, it's ""can you do it with me?"" He acts as though we do nothing together, which couldn't be further from the truth. A conversation at the dinner table just went:

Us: ""Its beautiful out, too bad it's late for a walk.""
Him: ""Could we still go outside, actually I want to play basketball.""
Us: ""Great idea, go ahead.""
Him: ""You guys aren't going to? Then I'm not, nevermind""

He's allergic to being on his own. Deep down I know it's a form of control, and he's been displaying a lot of spoiled behaviors around the house lately. The video games are becoming a problem, but we have failed to find a healthy balance. It seems he can't even get a taste of them without wanting and thinking about them constantly - and I feel like it is contributing to the behavior I'm talking about.

Sorry, I'm a little all over the place. So frustrated."

If we want him dropped down to 3 days (because we're having a hard time affording full time) its $245.

amha29,2021-04-20 22:36:13+00:00,My kid isn’t eating enough at school.,"Kid went to school on site starting February. I didn’t realize this sooner that him not eating enough at school means he’s not eating enough daily. 

We feed kid at the same time every single day, so it’s not like he’s starving or malnourished. But this might start affecting him because I didn’t realize this sooner.

He eats breakfast at home, then lunch at school and then he eats again right after school. Sometimes I pack him a lunch so I can see how much he eats at school.... he barely eats. 

Today I packed half a cheeseburger dog which is ground beef mixed with cheese shaped into a hot dog, and put into half a hot dog bun. Half a cup of grapes, half a cup of fries, 4 oz of apple sauce and 2 small cookies. Along with his drink.

He ate half of the grapes, half of the fries, a bit of apple sauce and half of his drink... that’s it. When he got home he said he was hungry, of course he barely ate anything at all! 

This is happening every single day. It’s not that he didn’t like the food, he just doesn’t eat. He ate pretty much the same thing after he took a shower. Which should be his 3rd daily meal but he didn’t really eat anything for his second meal.  Now he needs to eat again to get enough nutrients for the day, and he has 3-4 hours after school before he has to go to bed. I didn’t realize before that him not eating enough at school means he’s not eating enough daily."
tanjirhoe,2021-04-20 21:10:36+00:00,"I’m pregnant at 20 with my 22 year old boyfriend, is keeping it naive?","
To preface, my boyfriend and I have worked with and known each other for 2 years. We officially started dating 1 month ago, he’s met my family and I am meeting his dad this weekend. 

I just found out i was pregnant last week and he immediately wanted to keep it since the one thing in life that he’s wanted is to have a family. So much so that he promises to marry me should we keep it and would gladly work full time to support our family. He came from a single father household (his father was 17) and has worked with kids so he knows this is what he wants and the responsibility it comes with. He graduates this year with a psychology degree.

I’m 20, pursuing a double major at the same university, could graduate by this fall, and plan to go to law school after taking a gap year to study for the LSAT. It was originally never part of my plan to be pregnant although the idea of having a child makes me happy (i truly think i would not regret having one this soon as soon as i look at it). I have 25k in investments to fall back on while having a decently paying job (16.50/hr and 20hrs each week). I would eventually have my families support (no financially but they may offer to help with babysitting and offering knowledge) once they adjust. I currently pay for all of my own bills and he does as well.

I’m wondering if I’m crazy for even considering this. After all, we’ve been only dating for 1 month (have been living together the entire time) and we are both so young that i worry we will regret missing out on our twenties (I won’t even be able to drink on my 21st birthday). We would be relying on increased financial aid due to having a dependent, getting married, and no longer using our parents FAFSA. He also received settlement money (50k when he’s 25 and 50k when he’s 30). We would also have health insurance through my university. 

Am i being naive for wanting to keep it? What am i not considering?

TDLR: Me and my boyfriend are pregnant and without a long relationship history, i’m worried we are being too naive in wanting to keep it."

When I ask her why she is snapping at me, she says I make her mad because I'm always telling her to do something. Yes, she has chores, very basic chores that I've assigned her, which is cleaning the table, which is very small, sweeping the dining area, and clean/vacuum her room. She forgets to clean when she is supposed to so I have to tell her, that's why to her, it always sounds like I'm telling her to do something. She literally rolls her eyes, every single time. Instead of just saying ""ok mom"", it's ""I know, I was gonna do that right now"" or ""I know what to do"" or ""you dont have to tell me again"". But I'm repeating myself every single day to her about what she is supposed to do. 

She doesn't care about getting things taken away like her cell phone, YouTube privileges, extra chores, etc. We'll put her on punishment and afterwards its back to the same behavior. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do anymore. I'm thinking of taking us to therapy to maybe see if there's something else bothering her. Is this normal 9 year old behavior or what??"

Kid is strong-willed and not inclined to try new cups he doesn’t know how to maneuver. We have tried multiple straw cups including the honey bear - he doesn’t seem to understand that he has to close his lips and suck on a straw. Just kind of bites on it instead. So then we revert to the sippy.

Would it be cruel/wrong of me to take a cold turkey approach and just refuse to get out the sippy cups, and instead just offer him a straw or open cup? Would he figure it out or get super dehydrated? Help! Thanks!"

If I try to rock him to sleep, he claws at my face, slaps me, yanks my hair, etc.

If someone is playing with his toy he tries to hit them with it or he takes it and throws it at the floor.

When he tries to wake me up in the morning he comes running to my room and starts slapping me in the face.

If I tell him not to dig in the trash he kicks me, does this weird screech noise and starts digging harder...

He can't be around his cousins (who are also barely one, but none of which are walking or anywhere near his size. He's a big boy at 32 inches tall and 35 lbs) because he likes to step on them or push them over and laugh!

My unborn in-utero baby might be suffering from this and I want to ask what are the symptoms and how do they present?

It used to be for staying in her bedroom all night and it was quit hard for her to earn a sticker, then it was days with 0 tantrums, then when that phase ended we adapted it for doing basic chores.  The problem is that she is at school all week plus her little brother likes to help and there is basically no challenge in earning a sticker, or too hard because we haven't given her enough to do or there is no time.  Basically it's now hard to be consistent and fair. This used to be how she earned new toys but because of covid she has become too fixated on prizes so we want to ease off and maybe  make the reward chart for books and art supplies only.

So I am really asking two questions. 1) What kind of reward chart system do you use for a 5 year old and 3) How often do your kids get new toys?  Do they earn them or just get them randomly?"

He has been to inpatient treatment for suicidal thoughts and statements, he's seeing a therapist, got kicked out of his after school program for being constantly disruptive.... It's been very stressful, especially since he's never been a troublemaker before.  
    
I got a call from the school that he bear hugged a classmate, making her feel uncomfortable because his hands incidentally landed near her chest, and when she said so, he said it wasn't on purpose, then poked another girl's chest to demonstrate what on purpose would look like. And he followed that up the next day by putting his foot on a girl's crotch while she was sitting on the ground.  
    
I'm of a mindset at this point that I wish I could afford military school. He's going to ruin his life, and the constant stress of waiting for the next phone call telling me how he's screwing up is pretty rough.  
    
I'm going to have him write apology letters to the girls. I swear, if there were a big kid in the neighborhood I could pay to rough him up, I would consider it. People don't mess around with guys mistreating girls, and the sooner he learns it the better. Any sane suggestions are welcome."

Our toddler is about to turn 3 and is capable of doing most toilet actions completely by himself, reliably: opening the toilet lid, dropping the toddler seat into place, pulling down his pants and underpants, climbing into position, peeing/pooping, climbing back down, pulling his underpants and pants back up, flushing the toilet, and re-closing the lid. The only things he can't do by himself yet is wipe his butt or wash his hands. We're about to transition him to a ""big boy bed;"" he's never tried/had the inclination to climb out of his crib, so this will be his first time with the freedom to roam once he wakes up. I am of the opinion that part of his new morning autonomy includes the ability to go pee in the toilet if he wants to (he never poops before breakfast), which has the added benefit of easing the transition out of overnight diapers when the time comes. My husband is worried the toilet is still a hazard and wants to lock it shut. How credible is the toilet-drowning hazard at this age and level of capability?"

I’ll outline this scenario that now has my big one (8) chilling in time out for one hour. But overt disobedience is becoming a thing for her and the time out isn’t cutting it. I can tell on her face it’s like “yawn, eye roll, whatever mom. I’ve got 87 books and 250 stuffed cats to pass my time in my room, try me.” I need more creative consequences to hit the message home when pure reason just doesn’t do the job.

Less than an hour ago I had her and her two year old sister at the playground enjoying the perfect weather. Cue some lady showing up with her kids and a very large dog. My daughter followed my stranger dog rules and asked the owner if she could pet it before she tried, good!

The lady says ok but I notice the dog is eating or chewing a toy. I see my daughter reach out and the dog immediately backs away. This says to me, stop, danger. I call her over to me and say “even if that lady says it is ok, that dog is eating and backed away. That says no, I don’t want to be touched. Don’t go near the dog again, okay? And just as a rule, never touch a dog who is eating. Even nice dogs can get mean when they’re eating and you don’t want to get bit.”

My kid immediately, and I meant LITERALLY IMMEDIATELY turns away from me and heads right back to the dog and is now hovering about an arms length away. The lady, not having heard my talk with my daughter, asks her if she wants to feed it a treat. My daughter happily agrees and she gives the dog a treat. I call her back over and tell her we are leaving right now, she broke my rule and she will be having a timeout. She tries to say the lady offered and I cut her off, saying I said don’t even go back near them and you know I wouldn’t have wanted you to do that. She doesn’t make the rules for you, I do.

Aside of shooting me a dirty look, I can see none of this hit home and on the walk home she even asks if she can play in her room during the time out. This was not effective. What would you do to hammer home things like this? I don’t hit, I don’t yell. But she definitely behaves like my limits are optional and in a case like this it scares me, bc some stupid lady who brings a food defensive dog on the playground should not be who she is basing her choices on and if she got bit all the sorrys in the world wouldn’t help.

I was raised by wolves (pun unintended) so I need some help navigating this new, screw you mom, I do what I want, kind of phase."
MorgueMaus,2021-04-20 19:06:56+00:00,My four year old will. Not. Listen.,"I feel so lost.


My four year old (almost five) daughter has been so good, so attentive, polite, and followed directions for so long. As of recently, that has taken a nosedive.


It seems like if I give her even the tiniest request - don't bother the cat, don't destroy this, stop getting into this - she immediately does the opposite. It's like she physically cannot resist doing what I tell her not to. She stole scissors out of the back of one of our kitchen drawers and cut our cat's hair and some of her whiskers, then cut part of her own hair and hid the scissors, which are now being stored in the top of our cabinets. She's taken food out of our pantry, nibbled on it, then takes the leftovers and hides them. I asked her the other day to bring her bowl from lunch - literally a 10 foot walk - from her seat to the counter, and instead she hid it in the cabinet below the counter.


Just as an experiment, I had her sit on the couch next to a cat toy, and told her to not bother the toy for literally 60 seconds. I stepped behind the couch, out of view, but she knew I was there. Within about 20 seconds, she was playing with the toy.


We recently moved, and I ended up staying at home instead of working. We have been here for almost three months now, and this has just started up. I have tried reward charts, taking away privileges (ie cartoons during lunch, extra toys we had bought her), timeouts, and nothing is working.


Literally any advice is welcome. I'm feeling so stuck and I don't know what to do or how to help her."

Once we were in his bed it usually took around 15 min and he would be out, but now it has been taking 45+ min of him rolling around restless, WWE style 😅🤕 

Today for his nap I randomly thought to tell him a story after we turned his lights off.  Now I am not good at making up stories on the fly so I just did my best at telling the story of Petter Pan, I spoke softly and didn't get too loud or excited.  

Right when I started, he layed down next to me and held my hand while I was telling the story and was quiet and listening!  About 3-5 min in to telling the story (Wendy and brothers first trying to fly in the nursery) he was getting really sleepy, so I spoke quietly until I stopped talking and told him goodnight and kissed his forehead and he drifted off to sleep.  What a win!  Why didn't I think to try this b4?!  Well, we will try it again tonight and see what happens.  This might help my story telling abilities too, win win! 😆"

8 year old boy, second child, potty trained later (4 years old). Drinks primarily milk (water at school).

He can go 3-5 nights completely dry, then he will go 3-5 nights wetting the bed. I believe the problem is partly that he is a heavy sleeper, combined with being a night owl. I also believe he's a bit lazy and not overly motivated to care. 

He's past the age where sticker charts work, he's financially motivated though but apparently not enough to care that he's wetting the bed. 

He does not wake me up after he wets the bed, will get up and change himself, put a blanket down on the bed and go back to sleep. 

I've tried to limit letting him drink after a certain hour but haven't noticed a strong correlation between limiting drinks and wetting the bed. 

I work full time, out of the home, so getting home at 530 and then needing to do laundry is getting old. 

What other options may work? I'm half ready to just put him back into pull ups until he's 13.

My son first met them at the bus stop to school a few years ago, and they began knocking on our door at random times asking if my kids can play. I said yes in the beginning (when I didn't know them), as long as they stayed here, where I can monitor them. 

The more I watched them play here at my house, the less I liked them. I began pointing things out to my son, telling him ""a friend wouldn't to that"" or pointing out when they went straight for the computer or when they left him out and asking him ""are they here to play with *you* or our toys?"" He hesitated with his responses to these for a while because he's incredibly social and desperate for friends, but eventually he began to see for himself that they were not being nice and he told me he didn't like playing with them much (whew!). So he stopped saying yes and eventually they stopped coming over.

But this last year with COVID has been hardest on him because he wants/needs so much more social interaction than our other kids. In-person learning started again and they spoke on the bus, and now he wants to hang out with them again. I've let him come over and witnessed similar behavior to before, so I limit how often I say yes. I ask him ""are you sure you want to play with them?"", and he says yes, but I know my son is just desperate for someone to play with and will settle for anything. 

Now my son (10yo) has been asking to ride his bike around the block by himself, which I wouldn't mind if these kids didn't wander the neighborhood. I have a terrible feeling that these rides will result in him running into this group more often (every time we've taken a walk or gone to the park, one kid in particular shows up at some point). This kid has been a bad influence before, so even if my son leaves with good intentions of just riding around the block, I can picture him trying to talk my son into going somewhere with him and claiming ""she'll never know!""

But at the same time, I remember how much I loved riding my bike around the block as a kid. He wants to play outside and I hate the thought of depriving him of that."

I don't want to be judged when I take my child to the playground and she acts out times 10. I'm just so tired and am doing everything wrong. What can I do? I hate myself. I wish I would have waited to have her when I was older and more financially able to handle things. I have no help. So so tired."

I feel as though I haven’t done enough to enrich her education during this time for a variety of reasons and I’m panicked. I want to find a summer program for her or maybe just classes or really anything at this point to get her interacting with other kids her age and having more consistent educational experiences.

fc3sbob,2021-04-20 17:36:23+00:00,6 year old in online school is not going well for the second time.,"I am having a huge issue with my 6 year old in online school. Here in Canada we just went back to Online and this is the second time he's doing this with the first half of the second semester being in person.

In his last online class during his first semester he didn't know the teacher or students and would not participate, got angry, threw stuff, kicked, hit, left the room and would refuse to come back, scream for HOURS, ect. Probably the entire semester he did a day or two worth of class. The problem is, he's not like this at any other time. Not one other kid in the class was like this or had to have a parent sitting there. I'm a single dad half the week and had to hire someone to watch him so I could go back to work, She basically gave up after a month because she couldn't control him.

Now with this semester he knows all the students and teachers from in person classes that just ended and went online I was thinking this would work a bit better. We are half a day in and once again he's the only student not participating, turning off his camera, sitting on the floor/under his desk, walking out, more interested in when break time is, luckily no meltdowns or screaming yet. I don't understand how parents can work from home and do this. I have yet to see another adult on camera helping their kids or any other students acting like this, They seem to be perfectly following along. I'm not sure what to do. 

I've tried punishments (taking away electronics and toys), yelling, not yelling, reward systems. I can't get a grip on this and I don't know what to do.

He's about the same at his mom's house. I think she may be a bit more lax, at least with last semester, as in if he's not feeling it then he doesn't have to do it within reason, But we do work together on this as much as we can and she says she will be more strict with it this time around.

In person class, I haven't had a complaint and he seems to love it.

Any Advice?"
shelfoo,2021-04-20 17:23:16+00:00,Today my daughter accepted her first grown up job. The feels.,"My daughter is 22 years old, she finished up university last week with a Bachelors of Social Work, and today she accepted a job at a place related to her field. Full time. Salary. Benefits.

I cannot even begin to describe how happy I am for her. There's knowing that it's coming, and watching your children grow. But this, this feeling that's hitting me realizing that she's a completely independent adult. It's like nothing I've ever experienced. I think the grin on my face is as big as it was on the day she was born. 

I'm in awe of my daughter. She has worked so incredibly hard to get where she is. And the emotions are just bubbling out of me.

I don't really know why I'm posting. I guess first just because of how incredibly stoked I am for her. But also just to share with all of you parents out there. The struggles of raising a child are real. Lots of days where it feels so incredibly hard. But I'd easily do it all over again to experience this feeling."

OutrageousSea5212,2021-04-20 16:53:12+00:00,Baby keeps covering her head and holding her breath??,"My baby is 7 months old and, for the last month, has been pulling the closest piece of cloth (ie clothing, receiving blanket, clothy toy) over her face. She does this when she's on her back and will do it repeatedly if I let her. If there's no blanket close by, she'll improvise with small toys.

When her face is covered, she flails her arms and legs and appears to hold her breath, so obviously it freaks me out. She looks like she's struggling and suffocating. If I wait, most of the time she'll eventually whip the cloth free from her face, make eye contact with me, and then do it again. But sometimes it feels like it goes on too long and I race to throw the cloth away. 

I'm guessing this is an object permanence thing (she's effectively playing peekaboo with herself). 

Do I just let her keep experimenting so she gets bored with it eventually? Is this a phase anyone else has witnessed? It does NOT help my PPA."

Splashingcolor,2021-04-20 16:27:53+00:00,Sick of virtual band class (rant),"Whoever at my child's school who decided it was a good idea to have virtual band class **at 7:30 AM** is a freaking asshole.

Every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday we are woken up by the sounds of our 13yo trying to play the **trumpet**. I'm a sahm and my SO works from home and doesn't start work until 9, somedays not till after 10. Apparently though, our child's school believes everyone is up and started with their day by 7:30 so a drum, trumpet, or French horn playing this early is no issue. 

You know who does think it's a serious issue? Our toddler. Three days a week my toddler's sleep is interrupted and he is not a happy camper. The kid (like us) likes his sleep and tends to sleep in until 9:30-10 normally.

I'm sure we will all be excited once this is over and band class happens at whatever time the school wants, far far away from our bedrooms."
ILivetoEat_,2021-04-20 16:12:17+00:00,Is leaving baby overnight once in a while irresponsible?,"Hi everyone, I’m a future teen mom here with an AMAZING support system. I have a lot of people I can talk to, but to be completely honest, I’m afraid of being called a monster for even thinking about this. 

Here’s my question, is it normal to leave baby overnight once in a while to go out and have fun? I’m kind of planning ahead, and thinking that once he can sit up maybe i should think about going out and getting a drink with friends. I’ve asked my friends, but their not parents so while they all say I won’t be bad mom I don’t feel right taking advice from other teenagers. 

Growing up and currently, my mom never went out because she always rejected her friends offers, even though we can all take care of ourselves now. She also doesn’t drink and has always been a stay at home mom with me. She’s been a wonderful mom, and it leaves me wondering if this is what takes.

Basically, would it be irresponsible of me to leave baby with mom (If she wants too, she also doesn’t work and I’m the last one in the house) overnight once in a while to go out and be a teenager?  Is it normal to even be thinking about this so early? I’m willing to sacrifice everything to give my son the best life possible, so please be honest! It’s been weighing on me lately, and I would really like some insight from older, wiser people."
TrixDriver,2021-04-20 16:07:48+00:00,Four year old refusing to be potty trained?,"My nephew is three (he will be four in October) and he screams hysterically when we try and put him in pants (pull ups or normal) and won’t sit on the potty. He screams “I want a nappy on” over and over again and freaks out. When we tell him he needs to learn, he refuses and says no. My brother tries to be strong willed with him and tells him he can’t wear a nappy forever. He’s not a child who cries a lot but for some reason not wearing a nappy freaks him out, he’s not even at the stage of hating the feeling of a dirty nappy. He’s one of the only children in his playgroup who is still in nappies, something the staff have brought up. He watches his older brother use the toilet but it doesn’t encourage him. Also worth noting that when he does wear pants, he covers up his legs with a cushion or something similar. Is this normal? Is there anything we can do? He only stays with us a few days a week so it’s hard for us to get him trained. He was also slow at crawling, walking, speaking etc so we’ve tried not to push him too hard. I know it’s difficult to teach a child to do something if they’re not ready but we would like him to learn."

faucilover22,2021-04-20 15:29:27+00:00,Single Mom -- worried about hurting son by removing dog from our home.,"I need some advice. I’m a single mom — son is 15 and spends about 50 percent of time with me.  The other with his dad. My son (with his dad) have 2 small Maltese dogs. One was from our marriage and the other — I gave to my son as a present so the dog could have a friend.

I on the other hand had a golden retriever — I was engaged to a man for 6 years and he got that dog as my birthday gift. ( i never wanted a large dog, but here we were!)

The dog was extremely difficult. My now EX fiancé — hated the dog and I finally paid over 1k for the dog to go to a training bootcamp.. and he came back improved.  

My son loved the dog. After we broke up, my fiancé left the dog with me. I took the dog to get fixed….(my ex never wanted that). In a tragic weird siatuion — he died during that procedure. He apparently had an eneglarged heart and he died. We were all upset of course.

I went and bought a Maltese puppy. I have had that dog for almost a year now. He was getting stir crazy at home and my son kept asking me to get him a friend. I said maybe…. 

I finally broke down on easter and bought another puppy. Registered …good dog. But my Maltese is very bad with him. He’s aggressive toward the puppy AND he has also regressed in his potty training…. He pees everywhere and pees on my new puppy’s belongings etc.

I am at my Witts end. I am just over it — and I know that sounds cold, but I feel like I am not a good dog parent or whatever. I run my own business from home and I’m constantly picking up urine (mostly from the OLDER dog). The puppy has been pretty good about using the puppy pads! 

I am really considering re-homing both dogs at this point. But, I feel horrible even suggesting that… and I am worried about my son’s eactions because he loves them too. 

Any advice? I am losing my mind and my home has turned into a doggie urinal …."

I went from wrestling, climbing, exercising, and doing flips with my son every day to just laying around on the couch in pain for a week. He went from thinking his dad was this amazing, fun, indestructible, super hero to being afraid to even hug me or sit in my lap because he doesn't want to hurt me. It's been a little over a week and I am feeling better and healing up, but he is still incredibly nervous about touching me and the tics haven't slowed down.

throwawaybandmom,2021-04-20 15:01:50+00:00,Update/More Questions: My teen and marching band,"Previous post if anyone wants it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/lhosrg/help\_14yo\_and\_marching\_band\_do\_i\_let\_her/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/lhosrg/help_14yo_and_marching_band_do_i_let_her/)

The updates: shortly after the OP, we were able to get into counseling. She's been going every week and we have our first family session this week. I can't say we're seeing any major progress, she's still very disrespectful, bullies her brother and has issues with responsibility/apologies, but I see glimmers of hope and appreciate that she is really cooperative with the counselor and is willing/wanting to go. She's doing better in school and turning in her work and I think being on campus again has helped this. Her dad and I also sat down shortly after my OP and agreed that we would sign her up for band and allow her to go on the California trip. She hasn't been putting in very much effort/practice on her instrument ( as she agreed she would) but she seemed excited and I want her to have awesome things, so we stuck with the plan anyway.

...until now? I feel so guilty about this and I don't know if we're doing the right thing. This last week there was a fundraiser with the profits going directly to her student account to pay for her trip. She went around the neighborhood for a few days selling pizzas and ROCKED IT. I think she sold like 100 items total. Seriously, she was so impressive in how she'd talk to people and just hustle. I complimented her on this multiple times, as did her dad. I also told her I'd do her chores for the week so she could focus on her sales. I had to remind her every night to take the cash out of her envelope and leave it in the house so she wouldn't be walking around with so much money. I did this firstly for safety but also because she's absent minded and two years ago she LOST an entire fundraising envelope. Luckily that time around, she lost it at school and it got turned in. 

Well guess what? She did it again. She lost the envelope, but thankfully it's only about 6 checks and maybe $20. My current plan is to have HER go to the lost check houses and explain so they can cancel them and I will pay any bank fees. I will obviously make up any lost cash to the fundraiser. I'm embarrassed and annoyed, but shit happens, right? I mean, I once threw away my car keys on vacation (we found them after a frantic search). I'm not so much mad about the loss as I am at her reaction. When I asked where the envelope was (I wasn't angry when I asked) she screamed at me that I lost it, it was my fault and I must have moved it. She refused to search for it and when she finally did she screamed at her brother for not finding it. I sent her to retrace her steps and apparently, she didn't do that either. I drove the entire subdivision on the off chance that 24 hours later a random envelope was out there somewhere. She also told me the previous lost envelope 2 years ago ""never happened"" and implied I was lying. I've yet to get any sort of remorse over the lost money, just a brazen request if I still wanted to buy pizza and if she could still go on the trip.

Her dad says we should cancel the trip because it's scary to send her. She's immature and we don't feel she's ready. She's constantly forgetting her inhaler (asthmatic), frequently irresponsible and just seems to go mindless on important things. She has lost our house keys and cell phones so many times, she no longer has access to either on a regular basis. Two years ago we let her take an 3 day overnight school trip, she has a nut allergy and I know how she likes to go whole hog on sweets. I warned her multiple times DO NOT take food from other kids. Only eat what we/the school provides. The very first thing she did was binge on cookies with a friend -- and ended up in the emergency room. I had to leave work to make a 2.5 hour drive to get her from the ER. But the school said if I was fine with it and the doctor signed off, she could stay on the trip, so no 'real' consequence to her, but I did get a $300 ambulance/ER bill. I wish I could say this behavior was two years ago and no longer a worry, but I don't feel as if her maturity levels have grown much since then.

I cringe at what could happen with her 3000 miles away on a school trip. Is it wrong to take it away? I thought about going with her on the California trip but I don't  have the money for one person much less two to go (it's about $3000 each). Her dad is genuinely concerned it's more bad news waiting to happen. We both have anxiety. Are we freaking out over nothing? Being unreasonable? Yes, I do plan to discuss this at the family session in a few days.

TLDR: 14yo daughter is not very mature/responsible, may cancel her band trip to the Rose Bowl as a result. Feel like a shitty, horrible parent. I want to give her this and I'm so disappointed that I may not."

ChrissMiss_Mom,2021-04-20 14:43:38+00:00,I’m NOT SINGLE!!! My kids just have my last name!,"So I was in town with my 2 children(almost 3F and 10month M). Town for reference is an hour away from my house we live in a small semi off grid community. While I was in town with my 2 kids I ended up needing to visit the hospital/ER. They asked if they could call anyone I asked them to call my husband then the nurse looked confused AF. Me: my husband (name). Nurse: oh sorry on the kids paperwork I noticed you and your kids have the same last name but there is no male with the same last name noted. Me: X is my husband he kept his last name when we married.. Nurse looking more confused: K? But we will need a family member for the kids to pick them up I see your mom is listed. Me(mad now): phone their Dad my husband (name). Now I am in pain and don’t want to spend my time explaining nor is it my nurses responsibility to judge/explore my family’s name dynamic. They phoned my husband and let the kids go with him home while I stayed; but the same nurse a day later said it was a favour because they weren’t supposed to let kids go with people who weren’t a bio-relitive/legal guardian. I snapped back then it’s good they left with their biological dad you f’ing nut. 

So my rant: The world is changing, kids sometime take their moms last name. Parents who marry sometimes don’t take each other’s last name. And funny enough for our family my husband is the stay at home parent so really we just happened into a total role reversal situation from many small decisions but it not the job of an outsider to determine how valid my family is. My husband has ran into this trying to sign the kids up for a play space oh get their mom or bio dad to fill this out. Him that’s me these are my kids they just have their moms last name.. I knew what we were doing was unusual but IDK I didn’t think it would come up so much in legal barriers.."
Tomohawk1973,2021-04-20 14:21:36+00:00,Saw a pic of my daughter as a toddler,In the last year I’ve gone from a successful person with an important job (newly qualified nurse) and a father with 4 of my 5 kids at home to being unemployed after a breakdown and exhaustion leading to me losing my job and my son causing a massive family split. He did a terrible crime that came to light last September and it’s destroyed us. I just about thought I was getting on with my life when I saw a picture on Facebook memories of my daughter (who’s now 8) as a one-year-old. She’s eating an Easter bunny chocolate and has this Devine face of pure joy in the picture. It’s a beautiful thing and when I saw it I started to cry at my children growing up and I miss them at that age when they need you. My eldest is 23 and it was my second eldest that committed this crime. I look at this picture and see that child-like joy and I literally cannot stop crying. I feel broken and cannot remember the last time I felt joy like my girl in that pic. Probably the wrong place to post this but I guess I thought parents might understand.

PM5k,2021-04-20 13:49:12+00:00,"My son is nearly two now, still not talking or attempting babbling. Can I do anything?","So my boy is a month away from his second birthday, and he is generally just a ball of energy and happiness. He plays, explores, looks and plays with stuff he finds interesting, he also understands lots of things we tell him verbally like:

“It’s night time” - where he drops on the floor, squeals for half a second and then giggles and pretends he does not see us. Or goes to hide in his teepee as a response. 

“Get me your ball” - if he’s interested enough he will bring one of his coloured balls. 

“It’s breakfast/lunch/dinner time”, “don’t climb the stairs/get down from the stairs” or “it’s time to change your nappy”. 

So he definitely comprehends what is being said to him, and if he wants a snack he will take me by the hand and drag me into the kitchen and in front of the snack cupboard to signal he wants a treat. 

Me and my partner talk to him constantly, point to things and name them, ask for things from him and try to use small words that can be easily substituted by a baby for babble phrases like - cup/cuu, bowl/boh, ball/ba and so on. No big words when we talk to him. 

Anyway, we do that, we also tried the baby sign language. We try to point at books with pictures or describe stuff going on during play time like “look daddy is playing with the bus” or “catch the ball” and stuff like that. 

Yet still, he’s very non-verbal. Even though lots of people keep telling me boys talk later (and I myself didn’t start till 2.5y ) - It’s worrying me a lot. Before, I was worried that he may be autistic, but he makes plenty of eye contact, is constantly smiling (98% of his day he is one huge smiling potato) and he even gives unsolicited kisses (more like tries to eat your nose or mouth) or even cuddles. So the typical “signs” of autism like coldness, avoiding eye contact and so on aren’t there afaik. But I’m also aware it’s a spectrum and not a binary state, so I really can’t say anymore. Sometimes he will spend ten minutes running along a fence outside cause he likes the zooming pattern he sees from the gaps in the fence. He loves cars and chasing his reflection in ye paint job. So.. not sure if it’s anything to worry about when it comes to his fixations. What I do know is that I desperately want him to talk and I feel like I’ve run out of things to try. I just want to see some progress, even silly baby babbles that vaguely resemble words rather than squealing or yelling would probably make me weep from joy at this point. 

Do any of you have any experience with this? What can I do?"
gizel13,2021-04-20 13:48:01+00:00,Travel with newborn,"Hi 

I’m looking for advice to sense check my position on this situation because husband and I don’t agree. Really torn up. 

Long story short. Best friend getting married in May. I agreed to be MOH before covid. She’s now postponed wedding 4 times. Meanwhile I got pregnant and had a baby now 3 mos old. 

Wedding is 50-60 ppl. Sit down dinner etc. Mostly outdoors but ceremony indoors. Not everyone will be masked. It’s about 5 hour drive from us out of state. Baby will have to come with because BF but not to venue. Husband and I vaccinated. 

I’ve talked with her about my fears re covid and newborn. Probably had convo too late as she was pissed I didn’t bring up sooner. She had never asked me how I’d handle it or how she could accommodate so I wrongly assumed she’d understand if we couldn’t swing it. 

I’m TERRIFIED of risks to baby with pandemic but also would be sad not to be there for friend and risk friendship. Thoughts, internet strangers?"
Ducklanding20,2021-04-20 13:41:29+00:00,11 month monster,"I just don’t know what to do. My 11 month old has become a terror. He whines constantly. And I use that word literally. He’s not crying, no tears, he’s just whining. Doesn’t want to be held. Doesn’t want to be put down. Starts whining immediately after he’s done eating. Doesn’t want to watch cartoons. Doesn’t want to play with toys. Doesn’t want to go outside. Doesn’t want to cuddle. Doesn’t want to sleep. Doesn’t have to go to the bathroom. Tylenol doesn’t work. Doesn’t have an ear infection. I’m at my wits end here. The whining turns to full blown tantrums if I tell him no, turns into full blown wailing if I leave a room to use the bathroom. He was SUCH a great baby up until these past couple of weeks. I wouldn’t mind all of the indecisiveness if it wasn’t met with constant whining. We’ve tried teaching him some sign language just to break some of the communication barrier because I know he’s at an age where it’s frustrating to not be able to voice what’s wrong but we definitely started too late as the whining had already begun at that point so he has no interest. I almost feel like a piece of crap having to ask for help now but I’m at my wits end. Is this just a phase for this age? Or am I screwed."
fallenangel91,2021-04-20 13:38:08+00:00,Post natal depression. The Worst feeling,"So, I'm not here to get sympathy,  ask advice or anything but more to alleviate my feelings. 
My daughter is now going through the lovely teething stage so the last 3 nights have been horrible. Screaming at bed time, waking at 3am and every subsequent hour... well if you're reading this I'm sure you're aware. 

My 9 year old coped so much better with this and we barely noticed his teething stage to start with.

However, with all the sleep deprivation, her not even settling for an afternoon nap and such, I literally feel myself going insane. Shouting, crying... the lot. 

I am at the point where clearly I need to call my GP and get help, an ofcourse with it comes the feeling of being a terrible mum, and hating myself for being unable to cope.

Thank you for reading my rant, as typing this helped calm me down slightly"
Creepy_Fun_4937,2021-04-20 13:02:02+00:00,HELP We both end up crying😞,"My 7 year old is struggling with math.  She bombed a test and her teacher is allowing her to redo it but im struggling to understand her math enough to help her. 😣

Some background: My husband and I became parents at a young age(both 16) now we are both 24 and have 4 wonderful children. 2 of which go to school. I have struggled with math my whole life and now my oldest daughter is too. Her teacher suggested we do some more practice at home. I am trying, I really am but I hardly understand her math even though it's just 1st grade math. It normally ends with both of us crying and frustrated. I'd ask my husband to help but by time he gets off work it is time for dinner and baths and then bed. I'm afraid I'm having a negative impact on her education because I honestly have no idea how to help. I know basic math(add subtract multiply divide) but how they're having them do it now makes no sense to me. I message her teacher for help and she helps with what she can but sometimes I leave the convo more confused then when I started. I will google it or youtube it for help and sometimes that works great but other times not so much. I asked for a tutor but the school no longer does after school tutoring thanks to Covid. I'm truly at a loss here. Any other parents feel this way or have this issue? What has helped? 

If this was any other subject we would be fine because i did great in every other area of school. *sigh* 😞

Thank you in advance. 

(Please no comments about this is why babies shouldn't have babies etc. I get that on every single subreddit I post on about my kids. My age really has nothing to do with my math abilities)"
lyssatola,2021-04-20 12:56:46+00:00,The ongoing case of the kid not staying in her room...,"So in addition to our 5 year old getting up and wandering the house in the wee hours in the morning (see previous post). 

Last night she was caught taking money out of my purse...at 3:30am. Despite knowing she is not to touch my purse and that she's not to be DOWN-FRIGGIN-STAIRS in the middle of the night.

She was also wandering in and out of her room to the downstairs starting at 5:30am. When I went in to tell her to stop coming out her room, there was lipstick, lip balm, and a bottle of hand sanitizer from my purse on display like they were little friggin trophies.

When we asked her about why she was up and why she needed those items...she remembers being downstairs but had no answer as to why she did it or why she needed them. 

I'm thinking we need a gate at the top of the stairs to keep her on the top floor at night but eventually she's going to figure out how to use it. 

What am I missing here? I am so damned tired - I am getting to the point where feel like one of us has to be up at all hours of the day/night to make sure she doesn't get into stupid shit."
Arielcinderellaauror,2021-04-20 12:56:32+00:00,Do we prepare 5year old for the death of family cat or wait until it happens?,"My daughter is 5 and obsessed with our very elderly cat (19 years old) he's not in good health at all, he still has quality of life and no pain, he goes out and about still etc 

He has an over active thyroid and quoting the vet the most irregular heartbeat he's ever heard, he's also getting a bit constipated now. The vet visit was after he had lost a dramatic amount of weight so he's very skinny. He didn't react well with the medication for the thyroid issue and it would have done him more harm to stay on them so we're letting nature take its course as he's well exceeded his life expectancy and there's nothing that can be done about his heart issue at his age. 

Being 5 years old she's not really experienced death at all and he would be a huge loss for her I don't know if I should tell her so she is more prepared for it or just wait until he dies instead of having two traumatic experiences. I don't want her worrying about it everyday and feeling sad but I'm also worried about the huge shock it will be as she doesn't seem to understand when we say he's very old and what that really means however hard we try and explain. 

Also do we say he's gone to heaven even though we're not religious?"

siennesmith,2021-04-20 11:45:28+00:00,What was the best and worst nutrition advice you received during your pregnancy?," I think that the best pregnancy nutrition advice is to be careful about pregnancy nutritional advice lol. There’s just so much misinformation and contradictory information floating around that I had reached a point where I felt overwhelmed and unsure about even the smallest of decisions regarding my pregnancy diet. That’s how I learned it’s important to fact check ANY advice you get from family, friends (or internet strangers) with authoritative sources such as government sites or reliable and trustworthy websites. Creating a healthy pregnancy diet plan which will allow you to meet your nutritional requirements as well as give you some much-needed peace of mind knowing that your LO is getting everything he/she needs to grow and develop, is also helpful. You can check out [this](https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well/) link for everything you need to know when creating your pregnancy diet plan. 

Getting back to medically incorrect pregnancy nutritional advice or as I also like to call it – the worst nutrition advice – I thought that I would cover just two of the most harmful ones so that you can see the fallout from following such advice. I had probably been told by countless people that I am now “eating for two” but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Sure, my calorie requirements were higher during pregnancy but they were not double! In fact, I did not need to increase my calorie intake at all during my first trimester. During my second trimester, my daily calorie requirements increased by only 340 calories and by 450 calories in the third trimester. Also, please don’t just take my word for it, check out [this](https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandnutrition.html) link for more info on your calorie requirements during pregnancy. Just to put that calorie increase in proper perspective, I covered those additional 340 calories with just one large apple (116 calories), 1 tablespoon of peanut butter (94 calories), and 10 walnut halves (130 calories). 

Unfortunately, the myth of “eating for two” is so pervasive, that we drastically increase our calorie intake which leads to unhealthy weight gain during pregnancy. This excessive weight gain during pregnancy increases the risk of several health issues including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. What’s worse is that the baby is more likely to grow up to be overweight or obese as well as have a lifelong elevated cardiovascular and metabolic risk. 

Another incorrect pregnancy nutritional advice that I received will definitely have to be the use of Ayurvedic products and especially the ones that target pregnant women. Unfortunately, what most women don’t know is that the FDA does NOT review or approve ANY Ayurvedic products – so the label that states that the product is only made with “certified FDA approved ingredients” is misleading. In fact, the FDA issued a warning that 1 in 5 of all Ayurvedic preparations contains toxic metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic. Exposure to these metals has been linked to a variety of serious health issues, especially for unborn babies such as decreased fetal bone growth, brain damage, hearing and vision problems, and intrauterine growth retardation. So to sum it all up please please talk to your doctor before you add any tonic or supplement to your diet, especially the ones that are “recommended” to you by anyone that is not a doctor."
Monztur,2021-04-20 11:40:09+00:00,Need advice: 2 year old is a runner,"I'm a SAHM to a little boy who's turning 2 next week. 

I have been having an ongoing problem since he learned to crawl where I spend most of my day chasing him. 

If we aren't holding his hand he will bolt and keep running indefinitely never looking back. 

It's extremely stressful for me because he can open the gates at playgrounds and will just bolt. 

I keep trying to take him for toddler activities, but he just spends the whole time trying to run out of the exits. 

I see this behaviour a bit in other kids, but I have never met a kid where it's so extreme. He's totally out of control and I'm worried I'm not going to be able to catch him one day and he'll run off and get lost or hurt. I'm sick of having to be 100% focused on him at all times when I see other parents of toddlers being able to let them play at the playground a bit more independently. I hate being a helicopter parent, but his behaviour is dangerous if I'm not hoovering. 

It doesn't help that he refuses to use a pram (he fights so hard getting in that it felt like it was getting abusive tackling him in). I use one of those toddler backpacks with a leash, and hold his hand to get anywhere. This obviously isn't ideal.

Has anyone with older kids dealt with this? Can you give me some hope that this is just a very long phase? Any tips? I'm at the point where I don't want to take him anywhere."

wingsonawidow,2021-04-20 09:42:59+00:00,"My sister (28) and I(29F) had bad childhoods, we have no clue what we are doing","My sister and I did not have the best upbringing, our mother was honestly terrible and we are trying so hard to be better. But when the kids start acting up really bad we just don’t know how to handle it and we can’t tell if they are being normal children or if the behavior is excessive. 
For example, middle child who we will call R, is 8 and has a lot of melt downs over minor things. Yesterday it was because she was trying to get a drink but couldn’t tell if the dishes on the counter were clean or dirty so she like melted onto the floor, started scratching herself and basically shut down. I explained that if a dish is on the counter next to the sink it’s most likely dirty and she should always check the cupboards for clean cups. She has these meltdowns often, she also has pretty hardcore anxiety but her father refuses to allow us to see a therapist at all. It’s like whenever things are not clear and specific she panics and her brain shuts down and she starts scratching herself and the more upset she gets the less she is able to listen and communicate.
The youngest is 2, we will call him A. When my nieces were his age they could count to 30, say their alphabet and communicated in clear sentences with 4 and 5 letter words. Little man is really hard to understand and he gets frustrated when we can’t understand what he says. He also just does. Not. Listen. Not that he isn’t well behaved, imo being a non parent, he is much more behaved than most children. But when we try to sit him down and talk to him he absolutely refuses to look at us and hear what we are saying and won’t take no for an answer, does whatever he wants or cries about it. 
He is also EXTREMELY clingy and will not give my sister a moment to herself no matter what. The other day, all three kids were being awful and she was trying to cook dinner and he was at her feet demanding to be picked up, on repeat no stopping no listening and she snapped a bit and pushed him. Personally I don’t blame her at all, I would have done the same thing. But we were both badly abused and we both believe that you shouldn’t ever have to get physical with children. But in 100% honesty we do not know how to teach in any other way. If he is refusing to listen and continuously in between her and a hot stove while she’s also dealing with the girls being really bad, what the hell are you supposed to do? 
He wasn’t hurt, he didn’t get pushed hard, I think it hurt his feelings more than anything. But we both acknowledge that there’s gotta be a better way. And is it normal for kids his age to still not communicate this well? Do most 2 y/o’s have trouble listening like this and being this clingy? We don’t know what to do or how to handle it.

The eldest, H, gives us the least problems. She’s 11 and she’s the helper. But I feel like my sister puts too much responsibility on her then yells at her when she snaps at the younger ones telling her not to be a parent. And she has a point there but I don’t think she should put all the responsibilities she does on her and then snap at her like that when she steps in while they are fighting or misbehaving. 

Anyway, we are incredibly overwhelmed, I help as much as I can but I am also working. I have experience as a step mom but that was like 7 years ago and as an aunt I don’t want to cross lines with my sister. But she’s even more overwhelmed than I am. Any tips or even some outside perspective would be very much appreciated. Also want to add that I basically rescued them all from my abusive family and we have been living with 5 of us in my 1 bedroom apartment for the past month. We finally just got accepted into a bigger place and can start moving next week tho, but that’s where we are at."
SCATOL92,2021-04-20 09:19:33+00:00,Will this cleaning habit cause future problems?,"So when my kids were younger, if they were angry or stressed I would help them address those problems and then we would clean together. We would say ""let's scrub away that anger"" or ""let's tidy away those stressful thoughts"".

 Now they're 9, 11 and 13 and they just do this instinctively. Recently my 11 year old ""rage quit"" a video game he was frustrated with and ran downstairs to the cleaning cupboard and then cleaned all the windows and mirrors. It seems to actually help them and it's been great for them (and me!).

The problem is that last night my 13 year old was working on an essay for history homework. I went upstairs to take him some fruit and he was just sitting in his bedroom floor organising his sock drawer. I asked him what was going on and he said he was a bit stressed out with essay and he would get back to it in a minute. I helped him finish his socks and then helped him work on the essay. I'm worried that I have created this habit in them that they'll now use to procrastinate. Is this actually a healthy way to deal with stress? I'm questioning everything now."
TryNotToAssume,2021-04-20 09:07:50+00:00,Husband complains about being tired but he doesn't get up in the night,"I've had a rough couple of nights and just need a bit of a rant. Feel free to ignore.

I know there is a bit of a imbalance between what I do and what my husband does. He's very stressed with work though. It's something I will address once he's settled into his new job in a month or so.

What is really getting to me is him complaining about not getting enough sleep. He puts the baby to bed, usually around 8 or 9pm. Then he does whatever he wants until he goes to bed, usually around 11pm and gets up at 7.30am to look after the baby until 8.30am. At weekends he gets up when he wants.

I get up with the baby and see to all his needs. My husband ignores anything once he's put him down to sleep until 7.30.

The last couple of nights I've had basically no sleep as baby has been getting up every 1-2 hours.

My husband tells me he's not getting enough sleep and he's tired. That the baby disturbs him and he wakes up in the night. He tells his coworkers that he's tired because the baby had a rough night. He will  joke with them that it's the life of a new parent and fishes for sympathy.

I don't think he realises how tough it is for me. I don't think he'd last a week if he had to actually get up in the night and didn't get to stay in bed at the weekends.

He tells me I should nap during the day but makes a big deal of watching the baby (he won't sleep in his cot during the day) and at weekends theres always something he needs to do that doesn't allow me time to nap.

settlers_of_dunshire,2021-04-20 07:10:26+00:00,"Today my ""pandemic baby"" waved at strangers.","I'm a cancer survivor who wasn't supposed to be capable of procreation, but it happened so yay! As part of some huge cosmic joke that is my life, my son was born on February 29, 2020. We were SO excited to introduce him to the family and enjoy all of those precious family moments. But...By the time we were released from the hospital the world was shutting down. We lives hundreds of miles away from everyone we know, so flights were cancelled and tearful video chats were had. 

Here we are, nearly 14 months later. Due to distance and my health history, not a single family member or friend has met him. We video chat and we take daily walks, so he is aware that other people exist... But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried about his social development through all of this. I know that losing a parent (me) would impact his life far more than a year of isolation, so I swallow my sorrow and my doubt as much as possible. 

Lately he has been exhibiting signs of curiosity about others. He will watch other people at the park, and since we don't act fearful he seems to accept their presence. A few days ago he saw two boys playing soccer and he babbled and motioned in their direction to me. I should mention that he can run and kick a soccer ball, but this was the first time he saw others doing it. 

Then today, he randomly started waving and yelling ""hi"" to people in the park. My heart almost exploded. A little boy went jogging by and my kid took off after him waving and yelling hi and laughing. We took him around the park so we could keep him at a distance while practicing his new skill. It's so small, and for most kids this step might not even be noticed. But for me, this meant the world. My child has been isolated from people for his entire life, but he is still somehow a social and friendly little person. I can't wait for the day we get to introduce him to our friends and family. I know it will be a transition that requires patience and understanding, but I feel so much better about it now."

She also kept asking me about a baby shower which I have told countless times I do not want, I don't want gifts from people I've never spoken to it would be very uncomfortable for me. Then she said how she's DOING a ""family gathering"" at her house and to invite my mum and sister, I didn't clock on at first and said that I'll ask, then my boyfriend told me how shes basically just planning a baby shower, especially how shes planning to do it in August (the baby would only be a few weeks old) and I literally do not want lots of people around my baby when it's only a few weeks old, hell, I don't even want to go anywhere after having him for probably a few MONTHS as I'd literally just be adjusting to everything.

Then we went over for ""dinner"" 2 days ago, literally since that experience I can't sleep...it's 4am right now lol. 
We started eating the food she prepared and my boyfriend pointed out how the chips aren't edible, and I gave him a death stare bc it's rude to say that, but then I tried it and I understood completely...then he did it AGAIN with the chicken and literally had to spit it out, fair to say I didn't try that.
Besides the point I felt really awkward but I was still polite and just ate the sweetcorn.
She then started saying how auntie tony will never have anything to do with the baby, like to point out I have no idea who auntie tony is, and this sounded so possessive in my opinion and idk what type of weird dinner conversation that was but she started being really rude saying that she's as dumb as pig shi💩 etc etc it was very uncomfortable.

Later on she then proceeded to talk about what we are going to do about CHRISTMAS and the baby...saying how her family has her ""traditions"" and then my bf pointed out ""but I thought you don't like Christmas"" and she was like ""I hate it but I still want to spend time with the baby"" I told her that I'll probably spend Christmas Eve and Christmas morning at my mum's with the baby, and she was like ""ok so we're having him on Christmas day but I wanted to have the baby in the morning to spend time with him before the big gathering"" and I literally just stopped talking after that wtf... Im already dreading being there for Christmas day, and she expects me to come there before 10am so she can spend ""time with the baby"" what type of tradition is that?? Just sounds possessive to me...
Or saying if we could rotate that year to year... Like why tf are you planning so far ahead it's so strange to me.

Hey guys, So I am currently living with my dad and 2 little siblings ( 2 years of age) right now &amp; it’s been really rough this year, struggling to buy food. My brother &amp; sister are also growing out of their clothes ( a little chubby for their age ) and if anyone could help get us some food and clothing for them, that would be great 🙂

thorstenfuzzi666,2021-04-20 02:58:57+00:00,Looking for Unchosen Fatherhood Advice!,"Hello my friends!

Is  there anyone, female or male, that has dealt with the reality of  accidental pregnancy despite of contraception and a child as its  consequence in any way? (Or even forced fatherhood as the NY Times  calles it.)

As it's become a just  as beautiful as cruel reality for myself, I would love to connect with  conscious parents that did not become them by their own choice. Perhaps,  we can share some experiences and advice and exchange some of the quite  unique teachings this situation has to offer.

Even  if you have dealt with a similiar situation in a very different way or  something else makes it difficult to share; please don't feel judged!  I'm really just looking for perspectives based in experience – no matter  if they are coherent with my own ethics in this case.

Much love and greetings from Peru!"

Instead of prayer - we share one thing we’re grateful for at every meal.

bonzombiekitty,2021-04-20 02:31:44+00:00,4 year old has never been afraid of anything until now,"My 4yo daughter has never been scared of anything.  Never had an issue with the dark.  Was never worried about monsters or ghosts.  She's enjoyed scary things. A lot.  She likes shows and movies that would be fairly intense for age.  When she watched Brave, she was cheering on the fight between the bears, while her much older cousins had to leave the room.

That changed today.  Suddenly she's afraid to play by herself in her room, which she usually likes to do.  And she was afraid to go bed.  What frightened her so much?  Did she manage to watch a stone scenes from a horror movie?  Did she witness some tragic event?  No.

It was an episode of the Magic frickin School Bus.  Somehow Miss Frizzle had manage to frighten a girl whose favorite movie is The Nightmare Before Christmas."

I feel like I can't get anything done when he's home especially on the weekends and with summer break around the corner i juat feel its going to get worse. It's like he forgets that we (me or dad or both) have just spent hours entertaining him and is right back under our feet. He won't play on his own and would rather sit doing nothing if we're not entertaining him. When we finally do get him to do something he starts to tear up the house or break his toys. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, theres only so much entertaining I can muster. If you take a moment to do something for your self, it's a fit of ""you never do anything for me"" or ""why can't I have it"". It's to the point when bed time rolls around we say good night and then when the door closes any and all ""good nights"" and ""I'll see you in the mornings"" he shouts through the door go unanswered. I'm done. 

Any advice on how to get him to entertain himself for any length of time would be appreciated, he does suffer from ADHD and is currently taking medication, so I'm unsure if I would say this is related to that or just a him thing."
daffy_april,2021-04-20 02:23:11+00:00,16 year old wants to drop out,"So my 16 year old, bright, sensitive, intense son wants to drop out of school. He wants to be a game streamer on twitch and doesn't see how school will benefit him. He never completes his assignments, is failing all his courses and nothing we do/say is helping the situation. I get emails from his teachers complaining about him and I have nothing to say to them. He just doesn't listen. No amount of bribery or punishment has worked on him. And I don't want to force him or treat him like a child. 

He doesn't want to go to college and wants to start working right away, willing to take 2-3 jobs if he can only stream (bc I've told him he can't live here for free). He says he loves learning new things but hates tests and assignments. I dropped out of college (and barely made it through high school) and now making multiple 6 figures in my own business now which he keeps pointing out. I've told him to at least finish high school but he says (in a very rationale voice) that it's a waste of 2 years of his life(!). 

I guess I'm asking if it would be SO crazy to let him leave high school. I mean the worst that will happen is he regrets the decision and goes back to get his GED and college degree. Right?"

My LO is 16 months and is speech delayed. He has said words however they're very inconsistent. The words also come out... Elongated? It's so hard to describe. They're soft sounding and sound more like sounds than words. Ex: bird is buuuuuuuuuur. He responds well however tends to reply in a sing songy way. I'm sorry I don't have a better way to explain it. It isn't babbling - there's no mama or dada or baba. It's.. ooooohwaw, oooooooh,. He changes pitch too. Most of the time, I understand what the sounds are. It's almost like when someone hums a word - you know the word by the sound even though it wasn't said outloud.

Does anyone know what I'm trying to explain? 
He's on the waitlist for speech therapy however, I need to better understand what's going on and our PCP is.. not great and the waitlist is a year minimum.

I appreciate your help. Thank you."
Dreaming_Tree,2021-04-20 02:16:05+00:00,Sleep for two kids (3 &amp; 4) in newly divorced household.,"I have two children, 3 and 4 years old, who until recently have been sleeping in their own rooms. When my ex and I split two months ago, I stayed in the three bedroom where we were and she went to a two bedroom for now. She has them in a trundle bed, and it seems to be going well over there. The issue is that my 3 year old just got out of the crib literally the week of the split. It was necessary anyways especially with him being in a trundle bed at her house. Now that half the week is spent in the same room, they’re struggling to sleep separate at my place. So I figured it wouldn’t harm them to have them in the same room here too. For a year leading into the split though, my ex wife would sleep in my oldest kids room on a twin mattress on the floor, so now she struggles without someone in the room with her... but my youngest is consistently getting out of bed which gets her anxious about being alone. No matter how many times I walk my youngest back to bed, timeouts, etc, he consistently gets back out. At this point I don’t know what to do. He’s keeping her awake by consistently trying to play or just be out of the room, but I don’t even know how she will be if I take him out entirely and she’s alone for the first time in 1.5 years. Is it bad to just put him in his own room and baby gate him in? Then work on my oldest being able to sleep without someone in the room? Bed time has been fucking rough every single time. Exhausted and looking for opinions."
afinky,2021-04-20 02:00:00+00:00,Help! How to handle this weird gym teacher behavior (6th grade boy),"My ADHD fidgety 6th grade son goes to a school that includes a martial arts class (which sounds awesome, I know). He's not very coordinated and a few weeks ago the teacher demonstrated how unstable his stance was by kicking his foot and knocking him over- my kid got pretty banged up. I get that this could be a normal martial arts teaching technique but it wound up humiliating my son so much that he just started avoiding school/class on days when he knew he had to go to martial arts. When I found out he was skipping, I mentioned the incident to the school and they forced the teacher to ""check in"" with my son (which I imagine was awkward for them both but I figured it was behind us.)

Today my son sneaked into the school office, used the phone to call me saying he needed to be picked up and the school knew about it. When I got there, I found out that he had lied about the teachers knowing and was about to be pretty mad about it until we were a foot from the car and he burst into hysterical sobbing saying that the martial arts teacher had made fun of him in front of the whole class today-- in a mocking tone saying, ""what are you going to do, call mommy and daddy?"" when he got a scrape from a fall.

I'm struggling with how to handle this because it's not an optional elective but talking to the administration just made the borderline bullying behavior worse. My son is begging to not have to go back to class and I'm just not sure what to do. On one hand, if I let the school know what happened and ask for him to be excused from the class or talk to the teacher, it could cause an even worse feedback loop of retaliation. On the other, if I say nothing and he has to keep going. For a normally developing kid this would probably be a ""toughen up"" or ""these things happen"" moment but for those of you who had ADHD or other developmental delays in middle school- you know how completely difficult this might be for a kid without emotional self regulation. He's been forced to being near-tears in front of the whole school twice now. 

Intervene or stay out of it?"
not30flirtythriving,2021-04-20 01:52:44+00:00,Seeking advice on how to tell my kids my relationship with my boyfriend has ended.,"I’ve been in a relationship with someone for nine months. It got serious pretty quickly as I have two young boys (3 and 5). Their father doesn’t help much so I have them pretty much 100% of the time with no help from family, which made casual dating pretty impossible, thus the rapid progression of my new relationship.
Anyway, I met someone who was single with no children and he never really connected with them. He just isn’t a “kid” kind of guy; despite basically living here and doing all duties of a “stepfather” for them. He loves me a lot, and I think he struggles with the idea of settling down to a family that isn’t his.
He ended the relationship today pretty abruptly and selfishly. I am left alone and I’m struggling to deal with grieving the relationship, as well as somehow trying to say anything to my kids who are asking for him. I thought he was a permanent fixture in my life (and my kids’) but he left and has left me in pretty much radio silence. 

Has anyone been through something similar? How do I break it to them that someone they love isn’t here anymore? It was different when the relationship with their dad ended because atleast they still see eachother and is in their lives but this won’t be the same."
Epwavl,2021-04-20 01:33:56+00:00,Talk to me about the third child,"We have two amazing children, 1 and 4. Girl/boy. We always assumed we’d have two- but now I’m giving away all our baby stuff and it’s sort of breaking my heart! I think part of it is several people that we’re close to had/are having a third, which I always secretly thought was pure insanity, but now am feeling a bit wistful. Our situation is different- in all of these situations the mom is a SAHM, but I and my husband both work outside of the home full time (similar salaries but my job is more demanding). We don’t have any family around. We’re paying a crazy amount for full time daycare, and a third would possibly take us from comfortable to tight budget-wise. So I know it’s crazy, and I think I’m just feeling these things because if the finality of giving everything away. It really surprises me though- I really drug my feet deciding when to have #2. But now seeing the joy he brought to us after my initial fear makes me wonder if a 3D would be exactly the same- a little more work but a lot more love. 
In my mind- pros- I love my kids so much, more fun/inters family, lifetime support of multiple siblings (I’m one of 3 myself, but my parents had lots of help). I also had very easy pregnancies. Cons- financial stress for us, affects on college savings etc for the others, even less time with the 2 than I have now- which honestly I always feel like is never enough, it will be more difficult to travel, go out, etc. plus being outnumbered in terms of being able to be involved with every kids events/sports etc. we’d both have to get new cars. 

Please tell me a third is super hard and I’m just having baby fever from saying goodbye emotionally to the concept. Anyone go through a period of wondering but are happy you stuck with 2?
Thanks!"

Cant-Take-Jokes,2021-04-20 00:23:31+00:00,Am I Overreacting?,"Now 15 month old started daycare four months ago. Admittedly, she's a little behind with motor skills. She refuses to crawl or eat food most of the time and can't walk yet. 

We sent her to this daycare specifically because they were known for being elite in academics. They said they would have no trouble helping her crawl, walk, and eat, that she'd be 'caught up in no time'. We were fully prepared to supplement at home, we just don't know what to do and were hoping they would help since she wasn't responding to anything we tried.  

Since we have started, we've constantly noticed they weren't following the schedule and the care workers were being far too lax ( sitting on the ground doing nothing, talking to each other instead of doing activites, skipping outside and activities, etc)(There is a camera, we can watch). When we bring it up, they will fix it, but then revert back. They haven't been helping her at all, and we've noticed she just sits and plays by herself most of the time. We requested their help letting them know that she was seeing the daycare behavior specialist and she recommended it, and they still rarely helped despite their promises. 

Given that she has problems eating, we gave them formula and at enrollment were told the caretakers would give her baby food if she didn't eat particularly well that day. However we noticed that they did it a few times then never again. We brought it up and they said they've never done it and wouldn't. We went to the director who said that was completely untrue and she would talk to them, and they did it for a few days before stopping again. I also told them we didn't want her to have juice, but they've given her juice multiple times and then say that it wasn't on the file when I know it is. 

They do activities where they 'color' and 'learn letters', but the papers are clearly the caretakers coloring and tracing the letters for them. I'm gonna be real, she refuses to even hold a crayon, she didn't do those. Not sure what they're trying to do there. There are supposed to be real music teachers and language teachers ( I know silly for so young but it's never too early ) but they aren't available because of covid with no telling when they'll be back. These are a 'perk' of the steep price.

A month ago, we were called because another girl bit her in the face and arm. There were defined bite marks, two of them, but the bruising didn't last long. They had no excuse for why it happened. Then a week later, called again because she fell out of her chair and smacked her head. Okay, that happens. But today we were called and she was bitten again. This time there were multiple bruises all over her face. It doesn't look like she was just bitten. They said it was because one of the people went on break and there was only one person in the room who was changing a diaper despite there supposed to be a 1/6 ratio and there are 12 kids. 

I'm so disappointed because I had such high hopes for this place, but how many promises can they go back on and how many times is my kid going to get hurt? I want to pull her out, but I'm not sure where else to send her. Are they all the same? SO says I'm overreacting and this would happen anywhere. 

Veteran parents and anyone out there that's been through this - what would you do? Does this really happen everywhere? What should I do? 

TL:DR Daycare isn't holding up on promises and child keeps getting injured on their watch. Is it overreacting to switch?"

How should I approach the subject (she has a high EQ and is able to hold a serious conversation to a certain point) ?

TrickyNikkiB,2021-04-19 23:45:57+00:00,Colicky baby. Help,"My second born has been very difficult. Pushing my husband and I to the breaking point and making daycare go insane. I'm fearful that she will not take him soon. He is 11 weeks old today. He crys alot.He spits up alot. Even hours after eating. Many times it's clear. 
His pediatrician isn't concerned as he is healthily gaining weight and seems fine in that aspect.  I think he's gotten better over the last few weeks but it's still nothing like my first son.  We've gone from normal formula (target up and up blue stuff)  to thr gentle formula (purple target up and up brand). I don't think it's made any difference, maybe more difficult to burp now and his poop is usually dark green and smooth. He is always gassy. Arches his back when he is gassy. Yet besides all this he does sleep well.  We put him in his merlins magic sleep suit and in the swing for 10 mins and then transfer him to the pack n play and he is usually out for 4-6 hours
Doctor gave us some reflux medication that we can use if we want but I'd like to fix this with out medication if possible. I think he has more of a gas issue than reflux, but I'm not a doctor. His doctor also said we can try alimentum formula but I haven't yet. He seems to process normal formula into seedy poop(until the switch to gentle formula). Doctor says he should out grow it eventually. These last 11 weeks have gone by very slow. And I feel bad that I cant bond with my 27 month old son as I'm usually dealing with baby. 
When he spits up he doesn't cry or anything, just a ""happy spitter"" as I've seen the internet call it. 
He doesn't like to nap much, occasionally he'll nap for half the day but other than that it's 15 mins here or 20 mins there.
Anyone have a situation like this? Any words of advice ?  Has anyone had their daycare not take their colicky baby?"

Rule in my house is “No boys. Period.” Parties or study time, no big deal. However, sleepovers are another matter. I should also qualify that my daughter has declared herself to be pan-sexual. Therefore, the idea that sexual shenanigans could happen is not out of the realm of possibilities.

He bit someone last week, but didn’t break skin. He gets two more chances and I am almost certain he could be kicked out this week if he doesn’t chill out.

At home he bites. We have been doing timeout, scolding, etc... We have been trying for three months to get him to stop biting us. The plus side was he didn’t do it at daycare. They have had nothing but glowing things to say about him. He got tubes last week so his ears are still healing and we think that’s the cause for lashing out at daycare, but he has a temper as well.

At home if he gets told “no” on something he tries to take it out on his big brother. Doesn’t matter if his brother is involved or not: if he gets upset he seems to cope by biting us or his brother. We don’t know where this is coming from. He’s not teething. He’s a sweet kid 80% of the time, full of smiles and very giggly, but holy crap, the other 20% he is full of anger. We like this daycare (great teachers and learning plan) and really don’t wanna see him get kicked out. Anyone have advice? Is this maybe psychological?"
BlitzAtk,2021-04-19 22:37:28+00:00,How to help teach a toddler to share?,"Hello,

This has been a major challenge for both me and my wife. We assume our son (turning 3 this summer) has built up this habit from daycare with other kids. It pains us to see even the most harmless moment, he becomes mean.

Like when we teach him to wash hands with soap (you try to wash your soapy hands together with him) and he uses the back of his head or he uses his arm to shove you away.

What's a good method to teach the toddler to share?

Thanks for reading.

I’m a work from hom mom but my dad and my husbands mom will come babysit while I’m on work calls during the day. They take our daughter to nap around 1:30 pm daily and she falls asleep no problem. On mine and my husbands days off though, if we lay her down it takes an hour or more of screaming and freaking out before we can get her to sleep. I do the same things our parents do. No cell phone out, pet her head lay quietly and nope. Nothing. It sucks having such a chaotic and frantic time before she finally sleeps and almost always results with us being frustrated or head achey 😅 any advice?"

cubredx,2021-04-19 22:02:14+00:00,How to teach my daughter to be respectful of other's property?,"I have a massive pet peeve of kids going on stranger's property. I don't care if they're ""just"" cutting through, riding their bikes, or whatever else. Unless they have explicit permission from the homeowner, it's trespassing and disrespectful. And some of you might thing I just sound like a bitter old bag, but I know there are plenty of others who feel the same. It just gets old having your space violated by some rando kid who has no right to be there, but I digress.

Few of the other parents in my town seem concerned with teaching their kids to respect other people's property, so it concerns me that as my daughter approaches an age where she'll be allowed to venture out on her own or with friends a little bit, she's gonna fall into the same behavior.

The problem is, I'm not sure how to pound this into her head in 9-year-old terms. I don't remember what/how I was taught. I don't know if the reasoning about respecting and being considerate to people and their property. Obviously when she was a bit younger and we'd be out on walks I'd remind her to stay on the sidewalk/street, and she does when we're out now, but I don't know if she will when she's alone or with friends.

So, how do you go about this sort of thing? It's not exactly something I'll probably find out about if she disobeys or punish her for."
Pawsywawsy3,2021-04-19 21:42:31+00:00,4 Year Old Won’t Use the Bathroom at School,"We have a problem with our 4 year old who refuses to use the bathroom at school.  His teacher has been wonderful and is trying to help us but he only goes in the restroom but won’t pee. He says he can’t go. This is for a stretch of 6 hours.  We have tried to figure out if he’s scared of something, or some other reason and we’re clueless.  He holds it until he bursts (either at the end of the school day he has an accident or as soon as she gets home).

raggedyange77,2021-04-19 21:33:49+00:00,Teenagers and sex. A parenting dilemma,"My husband and I have a great relationship with our 16.5 year old son. We pride ourselves on our ability to communicate openly and honestly. So when he came to us recently and announced he and his girlfriend had begun sleeping together, we picked our jaws up off the floor, gave him a hug and said ‘thanks for trusting us with that information’... Then we both freaked out behind closed doors later that night.

We continue to freak out(quietly and a long way away from him). Although both our son and his girlfriend are legally of consenting age, our son is quite emotionally immature and very forgetful! In a later conversation, I asked if his girlfriend was taking contraceptives. He replied no, because of a pre-existing liver condition she can’t. He assured me they were having protected sex. It’s a disaster waiting to happen.

My husband feels that we should speak to the girlfriend’s mother but I’m very reluctant. She doesn’t have a great relationship with her parents and is open about this. She is of legal, consenting age and I don’t feel it’s my place to ‘out’ her to her parents.

By the same token, it doesn’t really feel like my place to open a discussion with her myself either. I’m not her Mum. I’m her boyfriend’s Mum. How awkward if I just start chatting to her about her sex life with my son 😳

On the flip side, an unplanned pregnancy for these two would be disastrous for their futures. So I’m a bit stumped as to what to do to help my son and his girlfriend navigate this new world they’ve entered. 

I feel he told us because he was inviting guidance. I’ve tried to impress on him the importance of controlling his DNA. I’ve told him ‘once you give it away, there are no take backsies and you may not have any control over what happens next. So be very protective and discerning with who you give it to and when’. He told me he understands. My concern is, accidents happen."

I'm starting to suspect adhd (runs in the family). He has very strong reactions to minor corrections and he runs away to his room. I have never sent him to his room for inappropriate behavior. He will also hide if he's uncomfortable and doesn't like people who press him to open up (he shuts down). He does better with people who allow him space to get comfortable and engage on his own terms. He's fine with familiar adults. 

He's quiet, observant, intelligent, and sensitive. I also worry about his ability to assert himself with peers, from what I've observed from a distance he shuts down and/or runs away. He however, has no issue hitting his twin while at home.

We role play; discuss things he can say to assert himself; practice appropriate ways to say hello to someone new.

Any tips, tricks, website are greatly appreciated."

ladydaniel,2021-04-19 20:55:41+00:00,Child gets sick everytime we meet other kids...,"The title unfortunately isn't really an exaggeration. My son is 4, and hopefullt going to start school in the fall. But we've noticed everytime we take him somewhere with other kids he has a cold the next day. It never fails. Playground, cold. Zoo, cold. Playdate, cold. We got rid of a children's museum membership because he kept getting sick when he went and we were concerned it was because they weren't cleaning properly. Nope, not the issue.


The weird part is he's fine around adults. We visited family recently and didn't have any issues from being on a crowded airplane. But we went to a playground yesterday and by the time he was ready for bed he was sniffling. 


I know the issue is because he's never been in daycare and the last year quarantining has only made it worse. His immune system isn't as strong because he hasn't been around a lot of other germy kids. I know the answer is to slowly get him out more often. But it feels like a vicious cycle of going out, getting sick for a few days, then going out and getting sick again. I'm very concerned about what will happen once he starts school. 

Anyone got any advice?"

Clearly we have not had a full on sex talk but he does know some/most anatomy of males and females. I’ve told him to make a baby the sperm for a male and egg from the female have to meet. But now how they get to the same place.

But seriously guys, wtf do I tell him?  Everyone always says “talk to them in an age appropriate way.” Guess what fellow parents, I don’t know what that means! Does anyone have any good book recommendations or advice about this kind of stuff? We’ve had other body talks with him but this is one of those conversations that I haven’t been looking forward too.

StillWill,2021-04-19 20:30:41+00:00,"Trying to pick a day care for the fall, Montessori vs Chesterbrook Academy","When I go back to work at the end of the summer (teacher), we will send our son to day care. He will be 18 months then. His grandparents have been watching him during the week for the past year. He will likely go to day care 3 days a week and his grandparents will watch him 2 days a week.

Everything about Montessori seems great, but it is crazy expensive and I have no idea if it is right for my son. He is very, very active and loves to move around constantly, picking things up, dragging things, getting into things. He's very curious and it is wonderful, but I don't know what kind of environment is best for him. He is very social and warms up to people and kids quickly, and loves being around others. 

We have also looked at Chesterbrook Academy, which is half the cost. Kind of hard to explain, but even though I know they are both businesses, Chesterbrook feels more like a business than a school. 

It's not like Montessori is even a bit more expensive, it's ridiculously more expensive:

Montessori: about 2k a month

Chesterbrook: about 1k a month (with a 10% teacher discount, not discount with Montessori).

Like I said, I love the idea of Montessori and my son being super independent and self-sufficient, but I don't know if it's really worth spending that much money or if it fits my son's personality. I'm not sure if he would thrive with limited structure or if he needs it - hard to tell, he's 14 months old!!

Any input would be helpful!"

Any time I express this to my wife (which is very little) she gives off a vibe as though I'm weird for even bringing it up. I would never discipline her for having an obsession with a celebrity, but am I wrong for not thinking she was the most positive role model at the time? Especially since Miley has had so many other phases, I wish she could look up to her in different ways rather than the attention grabbing ways.

I see so many people that got dogs once lockdown started lifting but we were still in store for who knows how long. Not us! Went to a pet store and wanted to get a fish. They wouldn’t let us get a fish without already having a tank at home and even though they had tanks crammed with fish, would only sell one per 5gal tank. Whatever. Walking out, my daughter got distracted by MICE. I got outvoted and we got a damn mouse. We have 3 cats, ffs. 

It’s been about a year. I like her. She’s cute. She’s sweet. She runs in her ball when we take her out and aside from her pee smelling like absolute nuclear acid, I like her. 

The other day, my husband went to get pet supplies while my daughter was at school. He got some new treats for the mouse. I heard a noise and thought it was her on her wheel, but sounded VERY loud. She’s in a room that’s locked, and so we knew that the cats didn’t knock anything over there, but thought we’d go down and give her new treats. 

I opened the door..... she was gone. Like, cage open, yet up on a surface where there was unlikely she could get down safely, and SURELY, would NEVER be able to get back up. I called for my husband. He was the last to see her, 12 hours ago. Well, shit. Like she’s in a huge room, lots of nooks and crannies. We felt all over the cage. Nothing. Did a cat get her? Did she run to some odd corner? We were actually calm. Got flashlights and just hoped we could either find her before school was over or think of what we would tell our daughter. I was leaning towards the latter, to be honest. 

After about 10 mins with no luck, I got up from under a storage table (which we took everything out of) to go look somewhere else. I happen to look at the open cage... and there’s this little perfect white mouse with a grin looking back at me through the still-completely open door. My husband and I confirmed with each other, we both felt around for her. Everywhere in the cage. 

I don’t know what happened. But I have never been so glad to see a mouse in my house."

But really, why does it seem like thinking about or actually having a third kid is so horrible? My husband and I currently have two girls (1 and 4) and we're discussing if we want a third or not. When I look this topic up online or on Reddit, it feels like all the posts are so negative about the topic! How you'll have no time for yourself, life isn't designed for a family of 5 (travel, tables at a restaurant, etc), or the whole zone defense vs man-on-man argument. I've also read articles that talk about parents of 3 being more stressed than parents of 4. 

I totally get that life will be crazier with more kids, but is 3 really that bad of a number?! What am I missing? I will say my biggest concern is finances because obviously having an additional kid will cost more but is it that much more that I wouldn't have the kid?! I don't think so. But that's also why I'm here, writing this post.

It was really nice. It was just us and we were having fun playing games, watch tv, running through the sprinkler, and playing with the dogs. I decided to take a moment and go outside for a smoke. I was gone all of 5 minutes and left the door open so I could at least hear her if I needed. When I came back in she was in a panic. She has a miniature connect four game and for the first time ever she decided to put a piece in her mouth. She was breathing fine everything was fine and at first I thought she full on swallowed it and she would of course later poop it out. But then she drops the bombshell on me. She can feel it stuck in her throat! Man, I’ve never driven to the hospital so fast in my life. It was stuck in her esophagus. While she could breathe just fine and wasn’t in any sort of immediate danger, at the time I didn’t know where this tint flat and round object was. We had X-rays taken, she was COVERED in drool because it was literally impossible for her to swallow, she was scared, I was scared it was a mess. 

At the end of the day everything was fine. It dislodged and she was left with a sore throat and a popsicle to get some fluids into her since it had been 3 hours at this point, but I feel like an absolute terrible mom for letting it happen. I threw out all of my cigarettes and anything else that would require me to take my eyes off her. I haven’t left her alone since it happened. Maybe I’m over reacting. But man I was just so scared. All I wanted was a couple moments to breathe. I was outside for less time than it takes me to shower and she’s never been one to put things in her mouth.

Am I over reacting? Should I have done anything different?"

As a COVID parent, I feel like we've had the luxury of not needing to deal with ""social logistics"" because none of our friends are gathering or hanging out anyway. However, as society starts to open back up again and friends start hanging out, I wonder: how did you deal with hangouts/friend gatherings that happened after your LO's bedtime?

No, I'm not even talking about bars or clubs. I'm saying...let's say your buddy invites you over for board games &amp; beer, and that starts at 7 PM (pretty reasonable time). But, your 4-month old's night time routine begins at 7:30 PM. After baby's asleep, you prooobably shouldn't be leaving him/her alone in your house.... yea?

So what did people do in non-COVID times with social gatherings &amp; hangouts, especially if they collide with your baby's bedtime? Did you just feel comfortable leaving baby alone at home after he/she's asleep? Did you need to hire a nanny every time? (And if you do, do you need to teach the nanny your LO's night time routine?) Did you just never hang out with friends unless it was in the morning or afternoon?

I struggle to relate to moms cause my kids aren’t bad? I guess that’s the only way to put it. I never have felt the need to have a drink cause they drive me crazy. I never have wanted to just get away from them. They both slept through the night by 6 weeks. Both kids were moved from our room to their own rooms by 4 months and they’re in bed by 7 without a fight everyday. My husband and I have always had time to be intimate and our house really is never that messy. The kids put their toys away and listen when we’re in public. They’re not picky eaters, they rarely have toddler tantrums. Even as infants I never felt exhausted from feedings or anything and transitioning from breast to bottle to formula wasn’t really that daunting either. They potty trained at 18 months and shortly after that were night trained to. 
They help with chores, they put away their dishes, they help with laundry. They never have an issue giving up electronics. 
I dont know maybe I’ll pay for it when they’re teenagers but right now I just can’t relate? Has anybody else gone through this? I know it’s weird but I almost feel alone in having overall just “good” kids.

Lizclaire29,2021-04-19 18:41:21+00:00,2 year old with sensory processing disorder,"My daughter just turned two and I’m fairly certain she has sensory processing disorder. She has had sensory issues ever since she was a baby - hated going in the car seat, getting her nails trimmed, taking baths, the textures of certain foods. As she’s gotten older her sensory issues have intensified. She refuses to sit down in the bathtub because she doesn’t like the feeling of water and hates when I wash her hair. She won’t wear jeans, protests socks, and she doesn’t let us put her hair up. She doesn’t struggle with loud noises (mostly) and she likes being at busy playgrounds etc, but she has full blown meltdowns whenever we transition from one activity to another. From what I’ve seen, her tantrums seem more intense than most kids’ and are definitely more frequent. 

She’s incredibly verbal for her age, has great fine motor, is extremely social (although shy at first), and her doctor has ruled out autism. He mentioned that it’s worth getting an OT eval but that insurance likely wouldn’t cover services since her issues aren’t pronounced enough to be considered medically necessary. He also said it could be worth it to pay for some OT sessions out of pocket.

I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and what the outcome was — did you explore OT services? Did your child grow out of this phase? Were there other resources and strategies you found useful?

Delivery-More,2021-04-19 18:22:25+00:00,Morning Routine Blowups,"My husband (38m) and I (36f) have two children: Arthur (3m) and Kate (18 months f)

Both my husband and I work form home, so we have been sending our son to preschool M-F since the beginning of March. Once he is there, he loves it and comes home happy and talking about his day. But mornings have always been difficult. Both my son and husband take forever to get out of bed. He has criticized me in the past for trying to keep to a strict morning routine because he can understand how tough it is for our son to get out of bed.

Here is what I (try) to do in rough time estimates:   
6:00am - I gently rub my sons back to begin waking him.   
6:05am - I turn on the light, trying to rouse him again.  
6:15am - If he is still not awake, I coax him to the livingroom to drink some milk and eat a granola/fruit bar (in case he isn't able to get out of the house on time).  
6:20am - Potty  
6:30am - Getting dressed; I offer two options for shirts and pants/shorts  
6:35am - Brush teeth in livingroom, watching TV to distract him  
6:40am - Finish milk while putting on his shoes, and jacket.  
6:55am - Mask up and out the door by 7am

Meanwhile, I wake my husband several times so that he's ready and out the door by 7am. If he leaves by then, he is able to come back and get to work. I am also able to fix myself up before waking my daughter at 7:30am.

Obviously I would not be here if things went smoothly. Almost every morning, Arthur still refuses to get up, loudly whining that he wants to stay home, that he is ""scared"" of school, and for me to ""go away."" ""Scared"" is his catch-all word for nervous, worried, anxious, even excited. We've talked to him at length about why he is ""scared,"" and it really comes across like he just doesn't like being made to do his schoolwork. I have no reason to believe that he is in any danger (physical or emotional) at the school. 

He gets plenty of sleep. He does not nap during the weekends; he wakes around 6:45am, bedtime is 6:30pm, he's asleep by 8pm. Weekdays, he wakes at about 6:15am, naps for an average of two hours at school, bedtime is 8pm, falls asleep before 9:30pm. 

He has always had trouble calming down. Once he gets in a frenzy, he can get violent, i.e. pushing, yelling at us to ""go away"" or ""no want to,"" throwing things, hitting, kicking, and now spitting. We have tried Time-outs (when he throws things or hurts someone), Time Ins/Calm Down Corner, belly breathing, glitter jars, letting him cry it out, etc. But nothing works!

I feel like this behavior is primarily defiance. He is three. He has fun with Mama and Dada during the weekends. He wants to stay home. So he fights, whines, and tantrums when he doesn't get his way. I try to be patient and give him a little more time. I've tried being enthusiastic and created a ""Morning Routine"" chart, where Daniel Tiger rides Trolley to each task, then give star rewards for completing it on time; extra star for doing it quietly. (I try not to say ""Don't wake up your sister."" since that might cause resentment against Kate.) Often, I end up having to gently force him, giving him chances to comply and calm himself down; I do not yell at him and rarely say anything harsh. I've threatened to just take him to school in his pajamas and ""nighttime undies,"" (nighttime diapers). I'm not sure his school would accept him if I did that.

The big problem is that we want his sister to sleep in until 7:30am. She is used to his antics by now and is really good about staying asleep and quiet. But some days it gets out of hand! My husband has tried to help keep Arthur calm, but his solution is to basically force him through the routine and get him out the door ASAP so as to not wake Kate (never works, imo). He has even accused me of favoritism because I let Arthur loudly whine so much, even though it might wake Kate.

Again, he's three! He's going to cry and whine when he doesn't get his way. But I can't give in when my husband and I both have a time crunch. And he won't go to sleep earlier, even when we move his bedtime.

I'm really at my wit's end! Any further suggestions from the community?

Note: During the weekends, I let Arthur sleep in until 7am at the latest."
dazzcarlos,2021-04-19 18:20:53+00:00,Age of children playing outside alone,"Sorry for the format in advance. So a little context, my kids are 5 and 3, the eldest started school last september and fit straight in (despite all covid restrictions). The past few weeks, kids have been ringing at our door asking if the eldest can go out to play. The half dozen or so kids in question are age 4-9ish. I have refused to let him out yet as my kid has little road sense when hes messing around (which im assuming is normal. But another reason is because i have witnessed these kids playing chicken with cars on our street, and even caught them breaking into gardens and also having proper kicking and fighting matches. This is just the stuff ive witnessed so god knows what else they are upto. But the past 2 nights, one kid has decided to knock on our windows to ask if my kid if he can come out to play. Obviously i said no. But im now questioning myself if its my parenting style being too strict or other parents being too care free. I dont want my kids to be indoor kids but i still dont feel comfortable letting them loose either. And i wouldnt want him teased for being locked in when hes at school. Does anyone have any advice on how to tackle this?"

TheAnna710,2021-04-19 18:00:56+00:00,"7 weeks, incomplete naps??","We currently have a 7 week old and I’m trying to navigate the soon transition out of a swaddle, so we’ve been working on doing naps with the Merlin sleep suit and I just bought a zipadee zip to see if that helps at all. 

Currently, I’ve been following wake windows and have found that he only sleeps about 45-60 min before waking up, however when we go to get him he’s clearly still tired and falls back asleep almost immediately in our arms - but as soon as we go to put him down, he’s awake and fussy and then the cycle begins. He will nap no problem for 2-3 hours if he’s on me or being held, he just seems to hate being in the bassinet or pack and play for sleep. Sometimes he wakes up immediately, sometimes he’s asleep for another 10 minutes but then wakes up. He does better overnight - 3-5 hour chunks, but he’s also fully swaddled still. 

I guess I’m trying to figure out, is this an issue of not being swaddled and him not being able to self soothe quite yet? Should we be trying to put him back down or just call it quits after that first chunk of sleep? 

I’m trying to be patient and not rush things but I also want to get on a semblance of a routine. I just feel like I haven’t figured out that magic thing that’s going to click yet. 

Any advice or feedback would be super duper appreciated!"
thegreatbeardman,2021-04-19 17:48:43+00:00,Picky &amp; Stubborn Eater - Who has solved this? 9yr old,"Been working on this one for awhile, here is what we got going on.

9 year old kid. 

Eats breakfast, no issues. Eats plain cheerios w/ milk, omelettes with nothing added, cheesy scrambled eggs, toast, almost any fruit is on the table. 

Eats lunch, no issues. Usually PB sandwiches, fruit, crackers, cheese sticks, yogurt. Typical kid stuff. 

Snacks, typically things like pretzels and hummus, more fruit, any sort of cracker / chip / pretezel type things. Also, if its a new snack or candy of any sort, no issue trying it. 

Dinner.... OMG. We only eat these very specific things. We wont try anything else. Not even if its a derivative of something we know we already like.   
1. Arbys roast beef sandwiches (gross) &amp; McDonalds. I don't typically take any of my kids here in the last year or two unless we are on a road trip.   
2. Hotdogs / mac n' cheese  
3. Spaghetti (plain with butter/cheese, red sauce, or pesto)  
4. Target chicken nuggets (I don't buy these either but she'd eat them all up)  
5. Chipotle bowls (rice, red tomato salsa, cheese, some shredded up chicken)

I've tried a number of things, nothing has worked yet.

1. Positive bribery with ice cream, money, no chores, 1x1 time. Nothing works.   
2. Trying to remove any sort of attention getting by not eating or being stubborn. I don't make a big deal trying to eat or not. It's offered every day. And the answer either way is just ""OK"".   
3. No negative attention. We don't talk down about it, she's not in trouble for not eating, etc.   
4. Making all sorts of food out of food that she definitely likes. Like she likes cheese. She likes nacho chips. She likes nachos and cheese. But, make cheesy nacho chips in the oven, gross, wont even try it. Make a chipotle bowl replica with lime rice, tomato salsa, cheese, wont try it. When she was really little, like 3 or 4, if you took her to a place and the french fries where not the square thin strands like McDonalds, heaven forbid waffle cut, or curly, or anything else, she wouldn't try it.   
4. Removed trying to feed her, she eats she eats, she doesn't she doesn't. This is what we are doing right now. If its one of those 5 things above, she'll eat. Otherwise, she'll sit at the table hungry. 

She's my most active kid. She's outside playing with friends non stop almost every second of the day. She plays soccer, and is trying to get into competitive soccer which is going to have her practicing more, running more, being even more active. She's pretty thin, but, not unhealthy (yet), but, she definitely could eat more and would probably help her growth, energy, everything else. I'm getting a little concerned, and at the same time, I don't want us to have to cook 2 different meals every day. 

She wakes up some morning with stomach aches, from not eating... 

Its not like she wont eat some of these things. If I can successfully hide something in food, she'll happily eat it up with no adverse reactions, as I was thinking maybe she has some sort of inert thing that makes her not want it / not feel well. But, so long as she doesn't know, she eats things just fine. 

She is also a very stubborn, strong willed, ""tomboy"", wild, youngest of 3 whose parents got divorced when she was 5-6 years old, who spends a week on and off with her other parent. I sometimes wonder if this has helped create this power dynamic she is currently in as I know it was a very confusing time for her especially. 

We don't have a bad relationship from what I can tell. She loves to hang out and watch tv with us. She wants us at all her soccer games. She has a normal relationship with her sibs. She has a lot of friends in school and in the neighborhood. Does pretty well in school minus 1 subject. 

I don't like the idea of catering to just her for dinner, as her sibs have / do try just about anything we throw at them, and they have even learned that they like vegetables, and new food. I don't want them to feel like she gets special treatment. 

I try to pump up her snacks after school just to get some more food in her to last since I know she'll be saying no most likely. There is no correlation to how much she eats at dinner based on food she gets in the afternoon. But I also don't like having to do this sort of thing either. 

I'm thinking about maybe some counseling / therapy work for her to just see if there is anything going on that she wont talk to me about. Going to reach out to her school as well to see if they got anyone who can also help. But, I'm not sure if any of it would help, she's not exactly open about her feelings until she's officially upset. 

Sigh... anyone got anything that I can try, things to think about, or success stories on how you did it for a similar kid? I'm running out of ideas that are still positive."
nothingsurgent,2021-04-19 17:07:37+00:00,High energy 3.5yo night time routine?,"My 2nd boy has more energy than the rest of the family combined. 

I can’t figure out a way to create a routine for him, and get him to sleep at the same time every day, plus I’m trying to figure out how to help him fall asleep.

The first problem is his ADHD-like behavior. If he’s not EXTREMELY tired (which is rare), he can’t lie down for more than 30 seconds, not to mention keeping his eyes closed, without starting to either talk or get up / play around.

I get impatient after sitting next to him for an hour, and I feel guilty b/c I don’t want to shut him up when he wants to talk to me, or refuse his requests (a toy, water, potty, food - Niall if them just an excuse to escape his boredom). 

Especially I feel bad when he says he’s hungry (although in 9 out of 10 times when I surrender he won’t really eat).

The poor kid can’t turn off his brain.

—— Things I’ve tried ——

- lullabies (helped a little until he was 2.5)
- white noise (helps with distractions from outside the room, but doesn’t solve the problem)
- touch (back rubs/tickles/head massages) - he hates it (other kid lives it and falls asleep in a minute).

 To make things worse: 

It takes so much time to put him down, I start really early.

But some days are just worst, if he’s not absolutely exhausted it can take 2-3 hours. When he’s tired it’ll take 30-60mins.

Lately he’s been getting grumpy and tired around 1PM, so we started a quick nap (30mins). The word thing is sometimes he will still be able to fall asleep by 7pm after a nap, and sometimes he’ll be up until 11PM.

So to sum up:

1. I can’t figure out how to crate a routine that’s consistent.

2. I’m out of ideas of things to do to help him shut down his brain and fall asleep. 

Please help :)"

I have a question that some might find silly, but thank you in advance for any feedback :)

I have a 7 month old son who I was breastfeeding you until 6 month mark. I only stopped because I wanted to get pregnant again but hadn’t started my period yet. I slowly cut back nursing to 1 pump session a day and finally started my period a few weeks ago. I’m still pumping 1x a day and am taking ovulation test strips. 

My question: now that I’ve started my period, can I start amping up my pumping/nursing to get my supply back up for my son or will that interfere with ovulating/trying to get pregnant again? Should I just stick to 1 pump a day? Cut back to nothing? Or can I try to bring my supply back up now that I have my period? I’d like to give my son breastmilk but getting pregnant again is my main priority. 

Thank you!!!"

SideWinderSyd,2021-04-19 16:16:40+00:00,I am appaled at what some parents allow to happen,"[Recently, I came across this](https://www.reddit.com/r/KidsAreFuckingStupid/comments/mtyba6/toddlers_wake_up_and_choose_violence_every_day/). I am shocked that this was allowed to happen.  The older child seems to have been trained precision in that throwing move.  

&amp;#x200B;

And that's not bad in itself, but allowing him to throw things at his younger sibling is just wrong.  It's evident that he's done it before and whoever was there had the audacity to film it and allow it it happen?   Accidents happen, but that was not an accident.  It was a calculated and practised move.

&amp;#x200B;

I would have stopped it from happening the first time.  Sure, a good aim is a nice skill, but a rule we have in our house is to never  throw things at another sibling, parent, friend, human or pet.  So it might be something harmless this time, but what next?  A sharp rock?  A paperweight?  A knife?   Siblings are not targets.  

&amp;#x200B;

Am I just getting too old for this generation?  All the Reddit repiles seem to be cheering the kid on.  I would cheer as well if he was throwing it at a  batter on the field, but  not when the other sibling is young, unprepared and defenseless."
toastfactory,2021-04-19 16:01:52+00:00,14 Year Old Son Struggling to Return to Normal Life,"I live in one of the most covid-cautious parts of the US. My kids just went back to in-person school two weeks ago.

My 12 year old seems to be doing all right, but my 14 year old is not. In the Before Times, he was a strong student who had a solid handful of friends. He wouldn't exactly be *thrilled* to see Monday morning roll around, but who is? He had the usual ups and downs for his age, but things were basically okay.

But after over a year of being at home sitting in front of the computer, this is a different kid. Every school morning is a slog. He doesn't want to go back, when he is there, doesn't really interact with his peers. Not that he enjoyed online learning at all, in fact he struggled with it quite a bit and complained about it a lot. But, being around people again is somehow even worse for him.

He was a mildly anxious kid before covid, which wasn't the end of the world - his dad has anxiety and depression, and we were able to help him cope. But now most days he tells me he is having panic attacks. (His teachers do not see this so they aren't severe, but I believe he is feeling something.) He goes to a tiny private school where everyone knows who he is and he gets tons of leeway and kindness from his teachers - it's a pretty sheltered environment. There's not really any calmer, gentler way to get back out into the world. And still, it's not going well.

We're getting him back into counseling, but in the meantime...I'm at a loss as to how I should be handling this as a parent. I'm scared that we're starting down a path where he never really adjusts back to the world. If he can't manage in his tiny private middle school where he has always been very comfortable, how is he going to handle high school in the fall?! So my instinct is to push him out of his comfort zone. But my husband is inclined to be more indulgent and just let him stay home. 

I just...don't believe the child is going to magically adjust back to the world if we don't push. He doesn't have to become a social butterfly, it's 100% fine if he prefers to be home, but he needs to be able to function out there. But my husband is the one who has personal experience with anxiety, so maybe I'm out of my lane. I don't want to ask for unreasonable things and make him resent me. I also don't want him on reddit in 10 years posting that he wished his parents had pushed him harder, you know?

Anyone else having this, or is mine the only kid that is not bounding enthusiastically into post-covid life?"

This was in the 90s, and she got $20 for an A and $10 for a B, no money for C or below. This applied only to her 5 main subjects but that meant that she could earn $100 per quarter. I was JEALOUS. I asked my mom if she'd pay me for good grades and she laughed right in my face. I was a bad student, got terrible grades, always had, and I didn't improve. I feel like I'd really have been motivated to get good grades by this money incentive! The way I see it, we get paid for our work as adults. We get a bonus if we do something extra well. This is kind of like that, right? (I'm self employed and get no bonus or raise at all, but generally speaking...)

I ask this because specifically my child is struggling to memorize her times tables and it is causing her to fall behind at school. I have a math worksheet I want her to complete every day after school and I was considering paying her $1 per sheet so she'd be excited to do it, rather than me forcing her and there being tears every day.

I_Mean_Not_Really,2021-04-19 15:21:38+00:00,"What to do with ""Life 2.0""","Ok, so this is kind of a big question.

I have three kids, 9, 11, and 13. Two girls and a boy.

To put it lightly, they have had it really really hard the last, about 7 years. To keep a long story short, their mom and I got divorced about 6 years ago and it just hasn't been very fun since. It was a VERY nasty breakup.  

I've moved twice, their mama's moved once, she met a guy and moved him in within a few weeks. I recently got remarried, last September, but we've been together about 5 years. We've only month together in my house for about a year. We've gone through the struggles of being single parents with not a lot of support or money. A LOT LOT LOT more than that, but we'd be here for years.

My son almost died in 2019. His body basically stopped making blood, so he was out of class a year before even COVID. 

So during this pandemic, they started doing school from home and my wife and I started working from home. A blessing that we get to do that, for sure, but trying to get my job done while trying to get a 3rd, 5th and 7th grader through school, to be quite honest it's been a fruitless endeavor. Two out of the three have ADHD, my youngest has ADHD and dyslexia, and I have adhd, ADD and dyslexia. Also... I'm literally not a teacher. And none of us are good at doing all this from home. I prefer to be in the office and they haven't been in a classroom in over a year.

Also, the house we live in, the house I bought before getting married, is just too small.

So academically, my son is very far behind. Like...really bad. He'll be in 8th grade next year and he hasn't been in a classroom since the beginning of 6th grade. He's regressed in almost every way. He's also REALLY small, so looking at him you would think he's still a 9-10 year old.

My oldest daughter has developed severe depression and isn't handling it well. Academically not as bad, but not good. 

My youngest, well she's a firecracker lunatic and though she doesn't really have a whole lot of homework and doesn't really take tests, just the sheer comprehension of things is way behind. Personality wise I don't think she's been affected at all, she's still silly and hilarious.

On top of all that, they've all turned into complete disorganized slobs. Partly because that's kind of how the mother is, but still.

With all that said, it's all coming to an end. 

They're going to be back in school next school year, and my son is doing in class summer school starting in June.

My wife and I just started house hunting, and we're fixing this place up to sell. We're able to afford a much bigger house than we thought, and we're going to sell this place for a lot more and I thought we were going to be able to. As far as I know, my wife and I are going to be working from home permanently, so I'll build myself a nice little office and be good.

So I started thinking of the next house, as the next life. A truly next chapter. What I call ""Life 2.0"".

I have a lot about myself I have to fix, and directions I want to take my life and career. But I know how to go about that. I'm not sure what to do with the kids. 

I'm not totally sure with what to do about his immaturity, about her depression and the littlest ones academics. My wife and I are sitting down, making our plans and trying to paint that picture, but I have to admit I feel a little lost. Especially hard considering the custody agreement, week on week off.

So, looking to other parents whose kids have gone through a hard time, and how you pulled them back. How you fixed the damage of really bad years.

Thank you all"

3) light stroller, but rent car seats at destination (seems really expensive and risky)

We're leaning towards option 1. I think we want to have a good, light stroller to use at our destination since it will be for several months. Another option we found is the Mountain Buggy Nano V2 which is a light and compact stroller, but it also includes some straps to attach ANY car seat to it. So it's kind of the best of both worlds.

Nothing has changed at the daycare, same teachers, same friends and she loves being there (they send pictures of her happily playing 5 minutes after these meltdowns). Nothing has changed at home except that we finally ditched the pacifier, but that was about 6 weeks ago (not sure it's related as she never used them at daycare). Even the day care asked me what is going on because this never happened before...

We have tried time outs for not listening/cooperating, we have tried a visual chart with the morning routine, we have tried remaining calm and waiting her out, we have tried telling her we are not happy with how she is behaving and not listening. Nothing has stuck, and its just a battle every day.

I need help potty training my 2 year old daughter, I am a single mom with not much of a support system. 

I am having trouble getting her to go potty because 
a) she says she’s scared and 
b) doesn’t want to stop wearing diapers.
 
I try my best to encourage her to go potty and to try wearing panties for awhile but every-time she tells me no. 
 
I need tips to help me transition her from diaper to potty. (Bear in mind this is my only child and I have never potty trained before) Any help is appreciated."
sunnyelly,2021-04-19 14:33:07+00:00,Sleep issues,"My 2yo child goes to daycare 3-5 days a week. When she’s there she has an hour of quiet time after lunch and almost always falls asleep. This makes bedtime hell. She often stays up till 10pm on the days she has a nap and then is miserable when we get up at 6am the next day. When I keep her home with me we push through with no nap and while she can seem cranky as a result, she goes down no problems around 7pm. She wakes up rested and pleasant the next day. 
Anyone else experience this? I’ve asked the daycare teachers and they say there is no expectation for her to sleep but she does have to be quiet. Should I be looking for a new daycare? We’ve tried everything to get her tired out on the days she naps but nothing works."

StuckInAPinetree,2021-04-19 13:27:03+00:00,5 year old grieving divorce + mom guilt,"Hey everyone

I’m hoping this is okay to post here. My ex-husband and I finalized our divorce last November after having a *very* unhealthy + unhappy marriage the last few years. It has been so hard on our 5 year old daughter. 

She has a lot of trouble like expressing her emotions- she isn’t violent or aggressive but she cries so easily and cries over the smallest things. It was her birthday recently and she wished that “mommy, daddy and I would hang out together again.” 😭 

I have looked into counseling for her but is there anything else divorced/co-parenting parents can offer for advice? 

Everyone keeps saying kids are resilient and she’ll move through this but honestly, that isn’t helping her right now. 

Is there anything you did to help your kids? Any conversation starters that helped? Books? Movies? 

It’s so hard because my ex-husband continues to blame me for giving up on our marriage and “abandoning him”, he places so much blame on me and blame on me for her having a hard time. It’s literally unbearable to think that I am the reason that she is unhappy. I feel incredibly guilty and just like selfish. Maybe I should have just stayed in my unhappy marriage so that she would have had an easier time. Did I completely fuck her up by trying to get out and get my own mental health and well-being straightened out? 

So much word vomit for this post. And I’m sorry about that. I just don’t know what to do, how to help her get through this thing that I inflicted on her. 😭"

idowithkozlowski,2021-04-19 13:00:03+00:00,Husband possible shift change,"
I currently work 6:30am-3:30pm, Monday-Friday. 

As of now my last day of work will be June 30th, I’ll be 37 weeks pregnant and will be a SAHM once baby girl is here. 

My husband currently works night shift. Current schedule looks like this 

Monday- home at 9am, leaves at 11pm
Tuesday- home at 9am, leaves at 11pm
Wednesday- home at 9am, leaves at 11pm
Thursday- home at 9am, leaves at 11pm 
Friday- home at 9am, off
Saturday- off 
Sunday- leaves at 11pm 

Now there’s a possibility of him switching to mid shift. 2 week day shifts and 2 weekend shifts. His schedule would be like this 

Monday-  “off”
Tuesday- leave at 3pm, home at 1am Wednesday 
Wednesday- leave at 3pm, home at 1 am Thursday 
Thursday- “off”
Friday- off 
Saturday- leave at 11am, home at 1 am Sunday 
Sunday- leave at 11am, home at 1 am Monday. 

Which of these two shifts would you prefer your SO bad if you didn’t work? 

I think Mid shift would be better because he’ll actually get sleep. He could get home at 1am and sleep till 8 or 9, which is more then he sleeps now. Right now he’s barely getting 4-5 hours of sleep. 

I’m having a difficult time with the idea of him working weekends, even though I’d be staying home so the day itself shouldn’t matter. 

But then theres the thought of, should I quit my job earlier if he switches? If he were to switch before june, we wouldn’t see each other at all other then mondays, thursdays and Friday’s after 3pm. 

Can anyone think of pros vs cons to these shifts?"
LikeEveryoneSheKnows,2021-04-19 12:53:04+00:00,Leaving my kids for a week.,"Sadly, my Granny passed away this weekend and the funeral is on Friday. In Scotland you can have 20 people at a funeral. 

It's a long journey and it's not exactly an occasion I want to bring my kids to. The flights in and out are sparse at the moment, for obvious reasons, so I would end up away from my kids for a full week. My in laws are going to 'bubble' with us for the duration as my husband can't get a full week off work (he's a teacher) They are great and my husband and I trust them 100% but our daughter has never met them (again, for obvious reasons)

My 4 year old son will likely be fine as he will be in preschool for most of it. I have talked to him in advance and told him I have to go to away for a bit but that I will be back and I will see him on Skype etc. I'm more worried about my 4 month old daughter. Will she forget me? Will our bond be ruined? She will have her Daddy in the evenings but she has never been away from me. 

Has anyone gone away for this sort of length of time leaving a baby so young? Does anyone have any tips (or just kind words to assuage my guilt?) I'd never take this sort of trip if I didnt need to. I don't want to miss my Granny's funeral."

veggiesandvodka,2021-04-19 12:13:29+00:00,How to shop for tween girl clothing,"1. Birth a perfect bundle of little girl. 
2. Wait 11 years. 
3. Notice she has outgrown every single thing worn last summer. 
4. Take her shopping for her first bras during a pandemic when dressing rooms are closed.
5. Realize that clothing manufacturers have managed to create no less than half a dozen sizes that may fit your 5’2 11 year old. Is she a “girls” size 14? 16? Maybe she is a 16 slim or a 14 tall? 
Or is she a “juniors” size 11, 13, 15?
Maybe she’s a women’s xs? Or Small? What if the top is a ‘slim’ or ‘fitted’ cut.
Why is *every* pair somehow “high-rise” shorts? Does she need a 3.5, 4 or 5 inch inseam? 
6. Throw up your hands in the middle of the third store and just buy one of everything knowing you’ll return 7/8 of it later... I guess closing all the fitting rooms was pretty pointless. 
7. Arrive home to find that she is in fact a girls 14/16 AND a women’s small *except* when she is a women’s extra small. Discover that none of the shorts work, regardless of inseam length. 
8. Buy your tween an ice cream for surviving the whole ordeal and not getting frustrated once, even when you asked her to try on a bra over her shirt in full view of all shoppers. 
9. Hear “This was so fun!! You’re the best, mom!”


Mission accomplished?"

He loves to draw so I figured comics would be a good starting point since it's more picture than writing, but he isn't even interested in reading that. 
I am hoping my fellow book worms would be able to help out. What is one book or series that got you into reading? I can't really recall if there is a book or series that got me into reading but I LOVE reading.

Getting him to read is a lot easier than getting him to write. He will have a meltdown if you ask him to write. He will spend most of his time drawing instead. He has a huge imagination and he can draw a picture and have a massive back story to it, but getting him to write it down or even do math word problems is like pulling teeth. He has no problem typing (since the kids are all doing online learning here) and actually prefers it to writing. Do I just let it happen and I guess go with the times, and let him ""write"" using the computer?

TheRuinedAge,2021-04-19 10:23:55+00:00,How to further help my overweight 12 year old daughter.,"Hello everyone, I need to start this conversation off by saying that my husband and I have already done everything we can aside from therapy, ( Which is our final step. We are uninsured and it would be very expensive.) to educate, and provide healthy alternative choices to our daughter. 

My husband and I are active and athletic, we work out together regularly. I work out at home and we also go to the gym. During the spring and summer we enjoy going roller skating, hiking, going to the park and playing frisbee, you get the idea.

Unfortunately our daughter has zero interest in these things anymore. We have brought her with us and she will try these activities with us for a short amount of time then decide she hates all of it. We try and do things as a family and make it fun! We made a whole day of taking her to a roller skate shop, getting her fitted for a snazzy pair of skates then to the park where she tried it for 5 seconds and hated every second. This continues for everything else really. 
We have also invested in an elliptical, stationary bike, and water tower for our home. Unfortunately she never usex any of it. 
The only thing she seems to enjoy anymore since she became a tween is being on her computer, or playing video games. All the time. This really manifested when Covid hit and she became home schooled.We plan to have her registered for regular school when she gets vaccinated. 

We have taught her healthy eating habits, appropriate portion sizes, how to read nutrition labels, and the importance of staying hydrated her whole life. We rarely keep junk food in the house, and we don't eat fast food very often, that's a treat. 

For dinners I cook a protein, various vegetables, and a healthy carb. They are wholesome, filling, and delicious.
We also keep a stock of various foods that are also healthy choices such as popcorns, yogurts, granola, oats, vegetables, fruits, salads, quality sandwich items, and pre cooked proteins. 

However it seems our daughter will often eat too much of it, or choose not to eat, then eat in the middle of the night after we go to bed. She often swears she doesn't do this but we have caught her many times. We remind her that these behaviors are why she is gaining weight in the first place but she simply continues. 
By now I'm sure you are thinking, "" Maybe this is simply who she wants to be."", And sure if our daughter chooses to be overweight then that is her choice. We wouldn't say anything more about it. 
But the problem is that she is extremely depressed about how she looks and absolutely hates herself. 
She has expressed extreme anxiety about going back to in person school, and doesn't like going outside because of how ashamed she is. 
Getting her updated on immunizations is a hard time for her because she is worried that doctors and nurses will comment on her weight. 

She came to my husband and I in tears based on her perception of herself. It was the single hardest thing to hear coming from her. Even with all the education and resources that we have offered her nothing seems to be working. We even recently adopted an energetic dog to hopefully initiate a new incentive towards being active, but most importantly offer new companionship, help with depression, and healthy responsibility.. But she  hardly interacts with him and simply shits herself away in her room for pretty much the whole day, on her computer. 

We can no longer gently remind her that her behaviors are a direct result of the effort she puts in. Or remind her that over eating at 3am is self sabotaging. She will lash out and tell us that she is tired of hearing the same thing from everyone around her and that we are not helping her, then shut herself away for a few days and avoid us. 

She refuses to work out at all and I have offered many incentives. She has also asked me to remind her to do so. She simply will do nothing for herself."

Keep a list!  Use the notes app or Google Keep to document milestones with your first - tooth at 8 months, pulling up at 9 months, etc.  If you have a second your pediatrician will ask you about your first's timeline to get a frame of reference for your second and like...I don't know - I have Hot Wheels in my purse, my 3 year old sneezed in my pocket, and the baby got poop in my hair.  

You think you'll never forget any of these precious moments, but it goes super fast and from a logistic perspective it wouldn't hurt to keep a running list.  Of course, journal and send your little one emails for them to check in the future or whatever for sentimentality's sake, but having a quick and easily accessible reference might not be a bad idea!"

MielYuna,2021-04-19 09:45:14+00:00,I hate my son's Pediatric Dermatologist!,"FTM here! My son is 5months old and diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis. We have been visiting the said Derma for 6weeks now and met her for 4times. I know treating eczema if a trial and error thing. What made me hate her is she's making me look bad. That everything I do with him is making things worse.

The first time we visit, she told us all some dos and don'ts.. mentioned that I should dress my baby double because it's colder for babies than adult. Also said avoid the carrier I was using coz it's not cotton. So I did.

2nd visit, told us we shouldn't as it might be too hot for the baby and he could swear that would make his flare ups worse. And to wear sleepsuit so he is covered with ""cottony material"".

3rd visit, LO was in sleepsuit. We waited long so LO fell asleep in my arms. We do not bring him in stroller there coz the clinic is quite small. Told us we shouldn't always carry him. that he should be in the stroller. Not to let the baby sleep in my arms. Not to wear footed sleepsuit as babies grows fast and since it's footed, when he is kicking the cloth will scratch his neck. Thus, flare up.

4th visit, LO was in collared white longsleeves, a cotton pants and shoes. Told us not to wear collar as it might be scratching the neck.

My sons worst flare up is in the neck.. For four visits, it hadn't gotten better. I am developing anxiety in this situation. My mind can't stop thinking that this is my fault, that I'm making things worse. In what way should I dress him? I should iron all his clothes to make sure no bacteria would make things worse. Should I even touch my son?

As of now, LO's eczema on his neck has not gotten better. And I don't want to go back to that doctor again!

Sorry for the long post. I'm just really frustrated.

TL;DR : Pediatric Dermatologist is giving me anxiety by making it seem like everything I do is making things worse."
Jakande01,2021-04-19 07:55:18+00:00,It's time to clean up hip-hop and rap music,"I took my time, and did some soul searching to analyze what I like and dislike about hip-hop/rap music, and that's how I arrived at what you see in the title of this post. I don't expect many people to agree with my take on hip-hop/rap music, and as a matter of fact, I expect a lot of push-back, *and that's cool.* In either case, I have to let the First Amendment prevail, so here it goes:

After listening to a wide variety or hip-hop music over the years, and actually enjoying some of it while despising an equal amount (more or less), I managed to reconcile my differences with the genre as a whole by means of dissecting its various themes and/or lyrical content.

I like rap songs with the type of themes and/or lyrical content that speak to the following:

1. Social consciousness
2. Politics &amp; Protest
3. Party rap
4. Love &amp; romance
5. Comedy or song parody
6. Christian, Motivational or Spiritual oriented hip-hop / rap

I strongly dislike (ok basically hate) rap songs with the type of themes and/or lyrical content that speak to the following:

1. Drugs
2. Thugs
3. Glorification of crime and/or high crime cities or areas (There's a difference between telling a story about where one is from as opposed to bragging about the drugs, thugs and murders that take place there.)
4. Misogyny (I can do without all the reference to bitches and ho's etc.)
5. N-word in damn near every verse or lyric which is just plain ignorant as far as I'm concerned.

There are many socio-economic reasons why so many people support the latter types of rap music themes that probably range from relating to it on a *'personal level'...* to *'entertainment' ...to 'honest and open-minded musical diversity'...* to *'just trying to fit-in with friends.'* I might not have covered all the reasons so many people dig the gangsta rap type stuff, but I'm sure I've touched on most of them.

As for me, well... if I'm going to listen to hip-hop/rap music at all, then I prefer a theme and lyrics with some substance, and not a bunch of poorly articulated chanting or mumbling about something ignorant, irresponsible and MINDLESS that does nothing for the spirit, soul or mind except promote and encourage anger, negativity and crime with backing music that sounds like a damn death and destruction scene from a horror movie! I mean like when you stop and actually think about it, you have to ask yourself *""do record companies and producers scientifically select certain types of backing music (or beats) and/or sound frequencies that attract certain people (or certain* ***races*** *of people) so they will buy certain types of rap music?""* As a Black adult who appreciates ***real music,*** I am glad that I can say none of this crap works for me or ON me!

How about THIS question: Why do we insist on making stars out of no-talent bums who do nothing but prance back and forth across a stage with their pants sagging looking like ""come and get it"" and yellin' about ***nothing?***!! I would rather listen to a good R&amp;B, rock, pop, disco, smooth jazz or even a C&amp;W song ANYDAY than the *ghetto garbage* that makes the charts these days... *and THAT'S coming from a Black man!* Yeah that's right... *some of us know better.*

As a Black man in America who genuinely ***does not care*** how popular and worldwide gangsta rap music has become... and someone who is not intimidated by its supporters and followers, I am compelled to take this topic one *'social and racial'* step further. Therefore, I have no problem coming right out and saying... and you can quote me on this... ""I honestly believe there are certain folks who literally ENJOY watching Black people (especially Black men) act like modern-day buffoons in the way they speak, dress, call one another the N-word, and even KILL each other over drugs and/or beefs."" I want any and everyone who reads this post to thoroughly understand that I am not saying ***all*** non-Black individuals think this way, but I ***am*** saying I strongly believe there are those who do. The list of gangsta rappers who have been killed continues to grow, and ***this*** should tell somebody *something* about the vile nature of their music and the company some of these individuals keep. What's the old adage within the Black community itself? ""You take a *ninja* out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of a *ninja*."" (Word substitution with 'ninja' was deliberate because I ***will not*** call another Black man the n-word in any form or spelling.) What I will say, however, is this: Ghetto is a '*state of mind'* as it relates to the way one thinks, behaves and lives life.""

Yes we all know that crime has always existed in the low-income neighborhoods we have normalized and popularized by calling ""The Hood"" (then complain when they become 'colonized' due to gentrification)... yeah we know about the crime rate in these areas... and the violence inspired by all this gangsta rap crap has definitely NOT helped. Sure some rappers channel some of their money back into the communities that helped put them on a pedestal, but no one wants to talk about the actual social, psychological and legal harm that's being done to so many low-income and at-risk Black and Brown youth in the damn PROCESS! I urge parents of younger kids and teens to pay attention to what their kids are listening to! Don't give up, and don't give in to the negativity just because it's popular and has been glamorized!

SOMEBODY PLEASE TAKE BACK THE MUSIC!!!

P.S. Yeah I know I'll probably catch a lot of smack for my views, and that's cool. The words stand on their own merit, and I do not intend to debate, argue, retract or apologize for my thoughts and opinions. As a matter of face, I fired up and ***added*** narrative since the original post, and the trolls and haters I have encountered can give themselves a round of applause for that."
fraggle200,2021-04-19 07:55:12+00:00,6 month old's napping is going in reverse. Is there anything else I can do?,"My son's 6 months and it seems that in the last 2 weeks his napping is going in reverse and getting shorter rather than him consolidating sleep cycles and napping for longer. 

My other half thinks we should be thankful for the fact he sleeps for 11-12hrs every night, which I am, but we're now getting to the point where he's getting about 1hr of napping during the day and the last 3-4hrs before his bedtime are a battle as he's so tired he doesn't know what way's up. the night before last, he was so tired that when we eventually got him to sleep for his last nap, he was fast asleep as if it was bed time. It wasn't a fun experience for anyone when we woke him up to change him before putting him to bed properly. 

He never napped for great periods of time up till now, he'd usually max out about 37 mins but over the course of the day, with 4-5 naps, this got him enough to make sure we weren't fighting an uphill battle. 

I've looked everywhere for advice on this and I think we're doing everything we can, I just don't know if there's anything else to try. 

Nap time starts with a 10-15 mins of wind down in a darkened room after the first or 2nd yawn appears, we change his diaper, put him down in his cot and, as previously within a few minutes he'd be asleep, now he lies there and gets more and more frantic and can't settle. I've resorted to holding him a few times till he's fallen asleep but I don't want to start something I later have to undo. pacifiers don't settle him as they're just the most fun thing ever to play with it seems and get him more worked up. 

Has anyone else had this and got through it? does it pass? or do we just accept that he's not great at napping and be thankful for the solid nights sleep? I'd happily give up an hour or 2 at night to get them during the day. There's the potential for teething but he's not too interested in anything that would help with that."

She obviously calls her dad “daddy”, but she also says it to other people too...including random men she sees when we’re out and about. 

Usually, when she calls a random man “daddy”, they chuckle and move on. Well, today at the checkout line, she pointed at this man behind us and calls him “daddy”. He started laughing and joking, “oh I don’t remember making you!” “Maybe I was your daddy in a different life!”

It was weird and I just gave a weak smile and thought it was over...But then this random man came over to me and picked my baby up out of the shopping cart. I watched this happen in slow motion. My sister whispered “don’t let this happen” but I was legit frozen in this weird politeness/fear induced stupor. 

Obviously baby was really uncomfortable and reaching for me. And he gave her back but my heart was racing the entire time and I couldn’t wait to get out of that store. 

He then bought her candy and gave it to her and I cannot stress how uncomfortable the situation made me feel. Even now, in the comfort of my home, with baby sleeping next to me, I feel uneasy about this situation. 

I think what scares me the most is just how unpredictable people can be and also how you really don’t know how you’d react when something unexpected happens. I’ve always considered myself a strong mama bear but in that moment...I just let this strange man pick up my baby and I just didn’t know what to do."

KleinSct5655,2021-04-19 05:34:44+00:00,How to get rid of iPads,"So COVID threw a wrench into our parenting completely and now my kids are used to using our iPads for 3-5 hours a day.     

One is 6, and one is 4.   

I turned playing with their toys into an income earning opportunity (a dime for every day they don’t use their iPads) and they have 0 desire to do that. (They have piggy banks and are always asking how they can earn money.).      

So we’re taking away the iPads for a week.   
We’ve locked them away.     

But my 6 yo will just sit on the couch and suck his thumb, or he’ll just sit on the floor in front of his toys, looking sad and miserable and zero desire.  

I’ll get on the floor with him, and try to play, and he just has no smile, he wants nothing to do with me. He doesn’t like any of my play ideas.   

The 4 yo dives right in. He has a blast when we play.   

The 6 yo has ADHD, I know this must make a difference somehow. I just feel like he’s miserable... he doesn’t want anything to do with playing with me or his dad or his sibling. He just wants his iPad.  

He even told me: “fine take it away for a week! but after a week? I’m just gonna go back to using it.”   


To which I replied; “that sounds like you’re threatening me, and I will not let you speak to me that way. That is not acceptable.”   

I’m screwing everything up, aren’t I? Is it too late? Is there no going back from the iPad?"

And then painful constipation hit and he refused to go anywhere near a potty, or even poop for awhile! 10 steps back! So we've taken a break). So I Googled how to potty train a 3 year old (lol?) and this popped up. Read it and weep! (For joy, hopefully):

""The American Association of Pediatrics reports that kids who begin potty training at 18 months are generally not fully trained until age 4, while kids who begin training at age 2 are generally fully trained by age 3. Many kids will not master bowel movements on the toilet until well into their fourth year."""
OutrageousSea5212,2021-04-19 05:19:31+00:00,My husband's brother shows no interest in our new baby.,"Is this a common thing? My husband's older brother has zero interest in our baby (ie asking how my SO is doing as a dad or asking to see how the baby is doing). There's been literally no acknowledgment or congratulations... And our first baby is 7 months now.  He's never checked in with my husband to see how he was coping as a new dad. It's really hurt my SO's feelings. 

My brother in law has a few kids himself and, while he does generally keep to himself, has texted to ask my husband other things. Just never any mention of the baby. 

We send Christmas gifts to his kids and hang out with his kids when they're in town. His brother hasn't seen our baby yet due to COVID in our area, but the complete lack of attention has been really disappointing. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Just wondering if it's a common occurrence. 

Sucks because I feel like new dads don't have a ton of outside emotional support and this would have been a wonderful source for my SO."

It got misplaced and I never got to see her in it. Well I just found it again and it made me sad. So my husband suggested I alter it to fit again.

Is2020myyear,2021-04-19 04:18:24+00:00,Not sure what to think or do anymore.,"Hey guys, got quite a conundrum here. Married my now wife back in 2019 and gained two stepdaughters and their biological father in my life. All 3 of them suffer from ptsd and/or cptsd from living with this guy. Furthermore my youngest has a rare autoimmune disease where she needs monthly infusions and the older one has lost a lot of her executive function processing power in her brain. 

I work a full time job from home due to covid and my wife and kids are also home full time due to covid as well. Kids are only here 50 percent of the time. 

I was raised in a house where swearing was kept to a minimum and if you loved someone and respected them you didn't swear at that at any time. My wife and her ex however have taught the kids that swearing is a common everyday occurrence and it is perfectly OK to call your teacher a b1tch when muted on zoom calls etc. Today it escalated into another fight with her because I calmly asked the youngest one to please stop using the f word anytime someone says something she doesn't like.

Anytime I try to calmly ask for a little respect from her or the kids in any manner she is quick to put me down and yell at me that I don't know the trauma that her or the kids have gone through or are going through and how dare I expect any of them to change when they aren't the problem.

We have tried couples counseling together but we were dismissed due to her unwillingness to realize or take accountability for her actions in the marital issues. The counselor also noted that she needed to work on the verbal and emotional abuse she was imposing on me just in our sessions let alone at home yet she continues to text me 100+ times when we get into a disagreement that I'm the problem and need to just accept the 3 of them for who they are instead of asking for the love and respect I provide to them.

Has anyone been down this road and had anything come of it other than leaving and finding a better life on the other side? I am still in counseling and got her to agree to couples counseling again tonight but with the stipulation that she was just going to do it to explain to the counselor what I need to change. 

I'm literally at the end of my rope and my heart is breaking to even admit that there are problems this big in the relationship I once felt so hopeful and excited about."
pandamonkey23,2021-04-19 03:56:56+00:00,Is changing daycare centres traumatic?,"Changing day care centres - is it traumatic for the kid? Considering moving my son to a centre with a much better reputation and Montessori preschool program (he’s been on the wait list since birth). 

My son is a little over 2.5 years old. He has lots of friends at the play-based centre where he is currently and seems to enjoy his day. He has been there since 10 months old and sees some of the kids outside of daycare. He does struggle to seperate in the mornings though. The staff turnover has been really high at his centre and the other place has very little staff changeover (teachers have been there for a minimum of 5 years). I was planning to move him at the end of this year but just heard of another favourite staff member leaving so I may try to get him a spot sooner. I mentioned this to a friend and she felt that a move would be quite traumatising at this age, with so much to get used to that is new. 

So my question is this - do the benefits of the change (constant and highly qualified staff, accredited Montessori program, great word of mouth reputation) outweigh the negatives (losing connections with friends, starting a new routine, getting used to new expectations/friends, slightly longer commute of extra 10 mins)? Unsure what is more important in the final years before starting school. 

For context, I wouldn’t describe my son as easy-going. He is highly emotional but also quite fun and social. He seeks out new friendship connections at the park etc.  I know that the research suggests that changing daycare centres has a negative impact on kids overall. I’m just quite fed up with the staff changes and the academic program is very basic for his preschool year. The other positive about changing is that he would be paving the way for his baby brother to get a spot at the highly regarded centre as well. 

Any parents of 2.5-3 year olds change daycare centres without too much drama?"
JTT841,2021-04-19 03:40:37+00:00,7 year old wants to do everything herself,"Hey everyone,

I have a daughter that just turned 7. When she was 2 she started wanting to help out with things, especially when her brother was born. She was very hands on and wanted to help us with everything regarding her brother like helping getting him dressed, changing diapers, feeding him, bathing, etc..
As she got older, she wanted to do a lot more things on her own like dressing herself, getting water from the fridge, getting her own snacks, etc.. well it got to the point where if we did things that she wanted to do, she would get really upset. For example, she wanted to always turn on/off lights in our bedroom and living room in the mornings and nights. If she saw that we turned them on in the morning, she would get upset and sometimes throw a huge tantrum. We explained to her that we needed to turn them on to see because we are helping get her brother ready for school and we have to wake up before she does.
She kept getting upset every morning until she finally accepted it/let it go. Her thing right now is that she wants to feed the cat, give her water, say goodnight and turn off the lights. Today before going to sleep I turned on the lights without thinking about it and she started getting upset. Our cat needed her water fountain refilled and it was later than normal so I was more in a rush, so I told her that I had to help with the water today. She got so upset that she started crying. I tried getting her to understand that these are little things that shouldn't make her so upset and that it's OK to have/get help or share responsibilities. Over the years I have also done some of the things she normally does so that it doesn't become such a habit of her always doing a specific thing. I don't know what else to do. I know that toddlers have the do everything myself phase, but is it normal for a 7 year old to still be like that?"

I give her a bottle when she wakes up and she goes right back to sleep. But I read online that at 6 months, they can’t stop the night feedings and be okay. 

Can anyone give me advice on what to do in this matter? I do wish my baby would not wake up as much as she does, but I feel like this is normal and not a whole lot can be done about it. She is teething and her teeth will probably come in soon, so that could be another factor. But I appreciate any advice on the matter. Thanks!

Spoiledwife77,2021-04-19 02:42:20+00:00,I’m about to lose my sh*t!,"Idk if anyone remembers but awhile back I posted about CPS placing my grandchildren with us. They were 3 weeks and 18 months at the time. We have had them over a year now and we now have a court order in place.  We want to keep them, and are worried they could go back to their sh*t parents. This next year will decide. 🤞🏻 

I have to give props to parents of children close in age!! I had my kids 7 years apart! I never had to do 2 kids in diapers at the same time!! Y’all deserve a flipping metal! I feel like I’m going to lose my shit some days! I have the main home inspection tomorrow , I have known for a week. I have been cleaning like crazy until like 2 days ago I said screw it and played the PS4 instead. 

I guess what chaps my ass is we have no help! My mom does what she can. But if I need to go to the dr or something where I can’t take kids I have to hope I can get it taken care of in an hour or 2 cause mom can’t handle both kids at the same time for very long. I tell CPS that and I get “nothing”. I can’t get daycare cause both of us don’t work for 40 hours a week. My husband works 40 hours a week but my job is a homemaker. Apparently that’s not considered a “job” and we definitely can’t afford daycare on our own. I have no family or friends that can watch them, they either have jobs or live to far away. 🤬 so to keep from going postal I do like I did a couple days ago and play video games instead of clean house.

Complex_River,2021-04-19 02:01:39+00:00,Concerned about parentification of my child as a parent with disabilities. Advice?,"I know its coming for children of parents with signifigant disabilities to become parentified and I really want to avoid this at all costs. However I was raised by a disabled parent who didnt consider such things so I have very little to go on as far as knowing where the line is. 

I have a caregiver who comes a few days a week and helps with household and hygiene stuff. My daughter (age 5) has recently taken up a kind of expensive hobby and wants to be able to buy more stuff for it than I can afford regularly.  She suggested I pay her instead of the caregiver (for the house chores- I'm not comfortable having my kid help with personal hygiene stuff). And I'm considering it, but I worry that basically having her take care of the house could put her at risk for feeling like a parent on one hand, on the other I think it's cool she wants to work for and earn what she gets and I think that's valuable. 

She would basically be taking over almost all the house chores. Now we are clean people so shed never have to pick up our messes, itd just be normal laundry, floors, kitchen, etc. She has put a great deal of effort into learning to do all these things well in hopes to get paid for them and she does just as good of a job as any adult. So, I would pay her the same as I do an adult. This would allow her to buy all the hobby stuff she wants (costume makeup and face painting gear). 

Like I dont want her to feel like the whole house is her responsibility, but at this point she keeps cleaning stuff to prove that she does a good job because she wants to be able to buy the stuff she wants so bad that I worry by not letter her take over a bunch of household stuff I'm sending the message that she isnt good enough or worthy of the responsibility. 

I've thought about this all week and told her I'd have an answer for her tomorrow and I still dont know what to say. This girl cleaned the whole houses baseboards yesterday while I took a nap to show me why I should give her the ""job"". 

I also love how much shes into the math of figuring out how much shed have to work to buy the things she wants. My current caregiver is cool and doesnt mind her hours/income being cut to do this, and she can go right back to it if my kid doesnt want to anymore. Its $80 a week worth of work. The current caregiver gets it regardless of how long it takes (shes super fast so hourly wasn't fair) so my kid would get paid the same for the same tasks.

I dont know if I'm overthinking this because I worry about the whole parentification thing what would yall do in this situation?"

So far she seems to be a very paranoid and protective mother. She basically won't let her baby cry and if he does start fussing she's running over to save him and scold the person who let him cry, like they did something to him. He's not reaching milestones like crawling because she's scared he'll get hurt? We told them to baby proof the house but it's still not enough. He even wears a special helmet now. 

It's like she always needs to be near him or she has a panic attack. The baby now cries if she's not near and he didn't used to do that. 

The husband gets this is an issue but he's also over protective too, as well as being sensitive to his wife's  anxiety. So he's not really doing anything to change anything. 

I feel like we shouldn't say shit because everyone has their way of raising their kids and everyone has their own opinion but this is just crazy."
spicymilk0,2021-04-19 01:01:59+00:00,I'm so afraid I've messed up with my daughter.,"My daughter is 3, will be 4 in June. She was born preterm but it's never stopped her. The plan was to start putting her in daycare last year but the pandemic shot that to hell and back. And now she's supposed to start preschool but I am so worried she's fallen way behind on her socialization and emotional behavior. 

Unfortunately I had to work and since the local daycares around me weren't accepting new kids, she went to grandma's. She's never played or even really been around kids her age. She does well playing by herself but it's only for an hour at most. Today, we went to our neighbor park and there was this other family (both kids were wearing masks) and he wanted to play with my daughter *so* bad and she just...froze and came and hid behind me and started crying. She has no idea how to play with others. She's my only child so it's not like she's had other children to model that behavior for her.

Her pediatrician has been against daycare since the pandemic started and has told me I'm not the only parent who will have socially stunted children but damnit, I am worried. What if she has awful social anxiety when she's older because of this? I worry that once she is in school, she won't be able to handle it. It's always been me and her and my mom doing the childcare so I really feel like I've dropped the ball here. :/"

Pros: 
-Safety during takeoff/landing &amp; potential turbulence or emergency landing
-Car seat doesn’t get thrown around by luggage handlers
-Extra space in row

Cons
- She hates the car seat and screams quite often in it, so I’d be tempted to get her out of it to not bother other passengers
- $1000/year of extra flight tickets

I know the odds of bad turbulence are probably 1 in 1000 or more, and my husband thinks I’m being a bit overanxious since so many people fly with lap children.

hybriss099,2021-04-19 00:07:48+00:00,Baby won’t sleep for daddy,"My wife and I have a 2 month old son. It’s our first child. In the last maybe two weeks, he no longer lets me put him to sleep at all. At first it was just at night my wife would have to rock him to sleep after I fed him, because he would stay up for hours with me if I tried. Now it’s started to happen during naps throughout the day too. I’ll do all the same things my wife does - I’ll hold him the same way, I’ll rock him the same way, I’ll walk with him, I’ll pat his butt or rub his feet. Nothing. I wouldn’t be so bothered if it was just his mom he liked better. That’s pretty expected, but he sleeps for everyone but me. My moms wife is retired and has been helping throughout the day while my wife is on maternity leave - she has no problem rocking him to sleep. His grandpa will come over in the evenings and watch him while my wife and I eat or go on a walk or something, and he has no issues getting him to sleep. My mom maybe comes over once a week, today she rocked him to sleep in minutes. It is just me. When I try he just cries and cries until someone else take him, then it’s almost instant relief. He loves me otherwise. We play and he gets big smiles and even brightens up when he sees me when waking up from a nap. I guess I’m just not comforting for him, which is starting to bum me out. Any suggestions on things for me to try so he feels more soothed by me?"

I don’t know if it’s the pandemic, my husband’s night time work schedule, or parenting a full blown threenager (maybe the unholy combination of it all) but I am completely wiped out. I’m super tired all the time. I’m scared to be around too many people. I was way sicker this time around. This pregnancy was also not planned. We were going to wait another year (pandemic and I started a new job last fall), but oops we had a contraception fail. 

I just feel completely detached from this pregnancy and I’m 25ish weeks along. Our nursery is nowhere near ready. Don’t even ask me about a theme. I start looking on Pinterest for inspiration and then close the app after 5 minutes. Hubby asks my thoughts on names. No idea. I haven’t been looking except for the day we found the gender out. I was way sicker this time around, and was on medication until 18 weeks. 

It just all feels bad this time around. I’m back in therapy because I had PPD with my last and I was doing great mentally until the morning sickness kicked in. Now I just feel so drained all the time and like I couldn’t care less about being pregnant right now. I don’t feel excited when the baby kicks or moves. I don’t feel excited for anything baby related really. The only two things I have gotten excited about where the first ultrasound and our non explosive gender reveal. 

Does this get better? Has anyone felt like this with baby number 2?"

Hi. Hubs and I are irritated with each other regarding a disagreement we had today. Our four year old was eating a lunch I prepared her: Noodle soup, whole wheat crackers, and a banana. She didn’t want anything except the crackers. She ate all the crackers and asked for more. Hubs told her no, she would have to eat more soup and banana first. I told him to just get her more crackers because what’s wrong with seconds? Our kid is very tall and skinny (33-34 lbs). So we went back and forth about that for a while. Meanwhile, she said she was done. She wasn’t going to eat any soup or banana and just wanted the five whole wheat crackers she had had. Then husband goes and makes her some peanut butter bread since she didn’t like her lunch, which I think sets a pretty terrible precedent, making us essentially into short order cooks.

So: 

If your kid wants seconds of something on their plate, do you make them clean the whole plate first? What if your kid is underweight? Isn’t seconds of at least part of the plate a good thing?


Also: Do you think it’s okay to make your kid a second main item if they don’t like the first main item?

Super annoyed and would like to come to a practical/reasonable agreement to avoid future issues. Thanks.

Note: I should also add that we are not a “clean your plate” household. I have been forced to clean my plate before until feeling sick. So we never force her to eat anything. She gets three meals and two snacks per day."
simplygrimly,2021-04-18 23:28:25+00:00,Need advice for intact son,"So my son is intact (uncircumcised) and is the first in either mine or SO’s family to be left intact. So we’ve basically been reliant on online advice and books as well as (sometimes questionable) pediatrician’s advice in terms of care and potty training. 

Son is seven now so we’re happily through most of potty training (nights are still a struggle) but I have a question that feels silly but I can’t seem to find a real answer to. 

When he pees, my son currently wipes after with a little square of tissue. I’ve never seen this advice but it’s what my SO told him to do. I’ve read online that it’s better to teach him to pull his skin back a bit for cleanliness but I know there are risks with detaching the skin before it’s ready. 

So basically what I’m asking is, is my SO right that he needs to wipe? Or is there a better way to teach him to use the restroom and walk away as clean as possible to prevent infections?"
LittleHouseBigMouse,2021-04-18 23:21:05+00:00,One of the hardest parts of having a kid with mental illness is the lack of understanding,"I have 3 kids. 15, 14, and 9. The 15 year old suffers from depression and anxiety. We are in a good spot right now and I am happy but there is so much misunderstanding of what that actually means. From family to friends people assume that because he is doing better that means all of his issues are resolved. Yes, we are in a good spot but I still go to bed worried that things will be worse tomorrow. I worry about things most parents of 15 year olds don't have to worry about. Sometimes it is even worse around the parents of my other friends kids. Being at a basketball game with my 14 year old or a dance competition with my 9 year old and being able to finally feel like a normal parent with normal concerns only to feel guilty for thinking that way. It's just so hard sometimes and so hard to talk about with people who don't get it. I tried talking to my sister about it and she was like, ""I thought J was doing good now?"" I know she means well but mental illness is a day to day thing. He isn't cured because he had a good day,  you know?"

Shinybrainpan,2021-04-18 23:10:31+00:00,Should I stop picking up my child?,"First time on r/parenting, hello! I am a 28f mom to a soon to be 5 year old boy. 
We are very affectionate with each other and love to snuggle and hug each other. Lately I have been questioning if I should stop picking him up, I still do under certain circumstances. When I’m introducing him to a new adult, for example, sometimes I will pick him up so he is closer to their level and has a better time focusing. When we are crossing a street, I will sometimes pick him up because he often walks very slowly and I just don’t feel that it’s safe to linger on the road. If I have no choice but to bring him to the grocery store with me, I typically have him sitting in the cart so he doesn’t wander off and like I mentioned, he can be very sluggish and I do not like to linger in public places. I am wondering if this is something I should start weaning myself off of right away, he is getting older and I want him to be able to function without me of course. It’s quite a habit of mine but I do notice myself doing it these days. At this point in his life he does not have any cognitive or physical disabilities that we’re aware of."
njcuban123,2021-04-18 22:54:02+00:00,Teenage son wants to drive 45 mins to meet a girl,"So, our son wants to drive 45 mins to go see a girl that we know nothing about. He will not tell us who she is, as he claims is personal.  He's 16 and just got his license. He claims that he can drive safely there. We've never been to that area ourselves. He's being extremely violent about it, saying that we are controlling him, etc, etc. 

My take is that we need to know 1) who he's meeting 2) where exactly and 3) how long he will be out. We do have tracking set up in the car. 

Are we right to say no, and under what conditions should we say yes?  Also, he's not doing great in school at the moment."
CuddlefishSpaceKitty,2021-04-18 22:10:02+00:00,I took away my 16 year old girl's phone. She refused to use her phone for six months.,"So my 16 year old came home after curfew of 11pm and as a consequence I confiscated her phone for 24 hours. When I took it she seemed apathetic with the whole ""I don't care"" attitude.

I understand this response is common from teenagers so I didn't think much of it. 

The next night when I tried to give it back, she told me to keep it because she didn't want it. I thought she was just bitter and trying to prove a point and I put her phone away in my safe for when she would ask for it back. Its been 6 months, I've been trying to get her to use her phone so I can text and call her when she's out to make sure she's okay. She just responds with ""I don't want it."" 

My daughter is really stubborn and she's always been like that. She's mature for her age and is generally very responsible although she's almost impossible to effectively punish when she does break the rules. I've tried grounding her but she's extremely introverted and doesn't go out much anyway. She likes to play video games and I've tried temporarily confiscating her laptop except for when she uses it for school, but she started doing the same thing of just altogether not taking back her laptop after her punishment is over.

I'm at a loss for what to do. Any advice?"
Puzzler456,2021-04-18 22:02:14+00:00,Lost,"I have a son who turned 18 a few months ago. My husband, his stepfather, has never had a good relationship with him and we have been together for 11 years. My son has always been difficult—doesn’t like authority, yells, and throws fits when he doesn’t get his way. He yells at me as well. My husband has threatened kicking him out when he turns 18 for years now unless he changed his ways...We have tried counseling. 

Well, here we are. A few nights ago my son woke us up by calling from the bathroom at 130 in the morning. I tried to ask him what was wrong but he wouldn’t tell me. He yelled at me on the phone and I hung up. This pattern repeated 3 more times before I went to him. I’m not sure where it escalated to this point, but it ended up with my son saying “you f***ing b*tch get in here”—apparently he wanted to show me that he puked in the toilet but never said he was puking. When he said that, I went to smack his mouth, he blocked me, and ended up violently grabbing me to pull me into the bathroom. My husband saw this, came running down the hall, tackled and punched my son repeatedly. The police were called. The next day my husband goes and files for eviction and a restraining order to get my son out faster. 

The devastation that I am feeling right now is beyond explanation. Even though my son is completely disrespectful to me, he is my son. I feel like I’m giving up on him if I let this go through. I know my husband will not allow him to say. We have 2 other children that are also being devastated by this environment. Part of me is ready to leave my husband because I am feeling so much resentment towards him, and I love my son. The other part says if I do that I am going to completely destroy my other two children. So lost."
emmahar,2021-04-18 21:51:54+00:00,"5 year old not settling to sleep, help!","We're at the end of our tether with our 5 year old. She's never been consistent with sleep, especially settling at night, but we can't live with such stress levels every night. She doesn't tell us what's up, she just spends hours messing around- can you move this pillow? I'm hungry. I want to face this way, you're stupid, you're making me angry, go downstairs and kill mom, I don't love you and I'll never talk to you again, etc etc. She rarely leaves her room but if we leave she will sometimes follow us, sometimes shout us, then cry, then get more and more upset. We aren't happy with her crying and getting upset, its just not the way we wish to parent, but we're out of sympathy for her, especially since she doesn't tell us whats actually stopping her. We have tried lavender spray (scares monsters and helps to have good dreams), dreamcatcher, night lights, pillows, teddies, bunk bed so she can go on the floor if she prefers and its more ""contained"" so she might feel safer. Weve tried reward charts and taking away toys, but they don't seem to work.
Our general bedtime routine is bath at 6pm for half an hour, then out of the bath and in our room for supper and reading a book / colouring in (with both of us), then brush teeth, in her room, 2 books with dim light, then we will sit in her room while she settles. We believe she has some anxiety and is definitely a sensitive spirited child, which is why we're happy sitting with her, but not while she's taking the piss with BS and not actually telling us the problem. She is usually, settled by 8.30 but often goes to 10pm.
We have stayed at other peoples houses and she usually settles well, we asked her why she's good at their house and she says ""because I want to impress them"". Why can't she impress us? She stays at her dads house on weekends and sleeps fine there, they don't stay in with her, they just leave her.
Weve told her about the importance of sleep, watched videos on it, our friends and family have reiterated it too. I feel like we should at least get 1 hour a day to ourselves after 5 years of this inconsistency"

My son was doing really well. Even taking himself to the potty occasionally. Now. He’s just. Not potty trained. It disappeared.  We’ve had no changed in the house. Nothing. He’s sleeping fine. All is good. He’s just not potty trained. 

I don’t believe this is a behaviour issues. I truly don’t. I know when my son is being a jerk. He just doesn’t seem to feel it. He will pee down to his socks and either act totally normal, or play quietly in one area so I don’t notice. (I’ve never punished him and never will for accidents, but he for sure knows they upset me). 

I’m really looking forward to this phase of my life to just be done.  And there have been so many times I’ve seen progress. Then we’re back to zero. We’ve seen a family doctor and Pediatrician. I’ve taken a potty training course online. (Oh crap potty training). Other than having some sensory issues my son is totally normal. He’s. Just. Not.  Effing. Potty trained.  

Anyone have help with regressions?  Do they just pass?  I get my son to help with cleanup but honestly he seems upset about the accidents so I try not to make him feel worse than he already does."
ermonda,2021-04-18 20:43:57+00:00,What do you do for young child’s chronic constipation,"My 4 year old has been dealing with constipation for a long time. We have brought her to the doctors. It gets better for a time but then bad again. 

We currently give her a half capful of mirilax a day. However, when she gets backed up a day or two she becomes terrified that it will hurt when she goes to the bathroom so she holds it in and makes it ten times worsen. This past week she went 6 days without pooping. She was so uncomfortable but couldn’t/wouldn’t get it out. When it gets this bad she also starts to hold her urine because she is so afraid of sitting on the toilet/pooping. 

She eats a good amount of fruit everyday. No veggies really but she eats chicken nuggets that have the veggies mixed in and sometimes we can get her to eat carrots. She is a picky eater but recently she has been trying new things. 

How do other parents deal with this? Please tell me anything you have found useful. 

She does have an autoimmune disease (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) but she is currently in medicated remission. Her medication, enbrel is not supposed to cause constipation."

He does this always when on his stomach. He started doing this just as he figured out how to move forward for the first time, by doing these crawl-leaps. 

Several times a day, ranging from 2 to 5 seconds, he would do this, and always look confused while he does it. I doubt it's one of the regular behavioral quirks that babies exhibit.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Does this look normal? My wife thinks it's entirely normal, but to me it seems everything but. This week he also started randomly shaking his head side to side, especially when in his crib, and it's sleeping time.

BocceBurger,2021-04-18 18:37:02+00:00,How to handle gifts of junk food?,"My daughter is the only child in the family, and so every year for every holiday all of the grandparents would give her whole full bags upon bags of candy. After Easter she'd have 3 full packages of jelly beans, whole cartons of chocolate eggs, 8 chocolate bunnies, full bags of Hershey kisses, 6 oez dispensers, etc. It's been a battle for YEARS to have the grandparents stop giving us so much candy. Last time was Halloween when my MIL gave so much I almost cried during the unwrapping of the gifts. It's hard because my child has a weight problem, and so do I, and so does my husband, and I try very hard to keep limited junk food in the house. When I was almost in tears over the Halloween excess, my FIL said ""it's a lot, but just spread it out, you've got candy to last you until summer"" but there are so many problems with that. My child will ask for that candy 20 times a day and so they've turned me into a no machine, just saying no all day long. Or I can say yes, and let her eat candy all day long for 4 or 5 weeks until it's all gone. Ive done both strategies and they're both awful. It's just too much food. So this year Easter came and my MIL finally didn't give a bunch of candy! (Probably because she saw me almost cry on Halloween) She gave a small bit, which is perfect, along with some healthy treats like oranges and apples. I was so happy! Like finally, after 10 years, it's finally sunk in.

So then the day after Easter my daughter's best friend's grandmother (who is her guardian, so knows my child well) drops off an Easter basket full of candy. 😭 Again, way over full. Bags and bags of candy, bags that are 30 servings per bag, she gave us 4 of them. She gave us 3 large chocolate bunnies. For 1 child! I'm so frustrated, and frankly this time my child wasn't even happy, she was like ""wow this is too much"" and she herself chose half to throw/give away. I felt weird saying anything to the lady, it was really nice and thoughtful, she had no way of knowing that we didn't want so much cand I guess.

So last night my daughter had a sleepover at this friend's house. And she was sent home with bags of candy! And packs of cheese crackers, and gummies, and gum, and six individually packed ""mug cakes"" for her to make herself a 500 calorie cake I guess? 6 500 calorie cakes? I'm so upset. I feel defeated.

My child's doctor has asked us to limit her ""junk food"" and so I asked my husband if he felt it would be weird for me to mention that to this friend's grandmother so she would stop giving us food like this? And he said it would be weird and that instead I should send the friend home with fruits and vegetables next time she's over...

What do I do? Accept the junk food and let my kid eat it all? Accept the junk food and encourage my child to throw/give some away, but then let her eat the rest even though doctor says it's a bad idea? Accept the junk food and say no a thousand times that she asks for it? Tell this woman about my child's medical issues so she will stop? Ask her to stop without divulging the reason? How do I not sound rude about it? It's all giving me so much anxiety."

username10661914,2021-04-18 18:17:51+00:00,I don’t understand how my daughter got so materialistic and shallow,"To preface: I love my daughter - I see myself in her the most, which might be my I’m taking this a bit hard

My 15 year old has been very materialistic lately. Designer brands are the only acceptable forms of clothing and she’s stopped valuing hard work

And I find it strange because that’s not how we raised her. She has an older brother (16, they’re Irish twins), a younger brother (13) and a younger sister (11) and she got hand me downs from her older cousin. We’ve always been quite well off but we’ve never taken it for granted. We drilled it into them that nothing comes if you don’t work hard. We even took them volunteering in remote settlements, to show them that we have it much better than many people, and also to teach them responsibility and kindness. I never bought any of them any designer clothes. And they’re certainly not spoilt

Plus, she’s become very different to her other siblings. My eldest, who’s like her best friend, is very down to earth and humble. My third is very sweet and bubbly and my fourth is super shy and intelligent. My daughter, however, is loud, quick-witted, sharp and persuasive (manipulative). She’s kind of like the “I only look out for number 1” person. No doubt she’d out-compete her siblings, if this were a nature documentary, but I’m wondering how she turned out so different. Make no mistake, I adore her spirit, but I’m just a bit confused

My husband (her father) usually buys her the designer gear, and I’m fine with it, because if she wants something, there are many of aunties and uncles she’s sweet-talked into loving her, who’ll pay for her. It’s better if it’s from our pocket and at least this way we can have a serious talk with her about her negative behaviour

With “hard work”, she’s a fighter, not a worker. Meaning if she gets a bad grade in class, she kicks up a fuss with the teacher and sometimes they change it. Not all the time obviously, but enough for her to think she’s a master manipulator

Maybe it’s her friends? She’s lucky enough to be at the “top of the social hierarchy”, as she tells me. It’s not something I encourage her to aim for but high school can be tough and I’m glad she’s found a place that makes her happy. And I’m not going to tell her she can’t hang out with her friends

I don’t know what to do. I’m worried if this attitude carries on, adult life is gonna hit her like a ghost train. We’ve done all we could to teach her the right lessons and it seems to have worked on our other kids. We try talking to her but it’s all just “ok mum and dad, you guys know best, I love you”, which blindsides us each time.

Anyway this is getting too long. Thanks for letting me vent

Tldr: I don’t get how she got so materialistic and shallow. Will she grow out of it?

PS: I don’t believe in comparing children to each other so the old “look at how great your brothers are” ain’t gonna cut it"

And school has been really hard for him for the last four years or so. 
I have a degree in fine arts painting. My mom is a well known artist. My mom said she was very similar to my son so her parents pushed her into art. 
She got scholarships to The Chicago art institute and Fulbright scholarships as well. 
I also had a very hard time in high school and boarding school really helped. I did much better in school and am still close with many of the kids I went to school with to this day. 
My kid also goes to an art based summer camp that he sadly she’s out of this year. It’s his happy place. It’s where he feels most at home.

He can stand on his own, and walk while holding onto something but he can’t walk on his own. I’m a young first time mom and all my other mommy’s friends babies walk on their own at around 8-9 months. Plus, he doesn’t wave, point or clap. He can play with toys and eat with his hands. I’ve been trying to teach him to wave, clap and point but he doesn’t seem interested and is distracted by everything else. He came a month early at 36 weeks and even though he’s not technically premature I notice in the beginning that his mile stones came a month late, but he’s way late with walking and hand gestures. Should I be worried? Is this a sign something is wrong w my son."
MomIrishTwins,2021-04-18 17:49:04+00:00,Do I step in?,"Sorry this is long!

My son (27) met a highly conservative deeply religious girl (24) 3 years ago when she was a junior at a strict Christian College in the city where he works.   They “courted” for two years and were engaged for a year. Now we are a little left, and religious so we welcomed her into our family. Her family lives about 6 hours away so they only met my son 4 times before the wedding.  

Now in the three years they were together we spent a lot of time with them and got to know the girl well. We love her and we watched as she begin to figure out who she wanted to be away from the strict constraints of her family. And boy were they strict.

Fast forward past all the wedding drama, which was interesting. But a whole another issue. Here is the problem. 

Her family is putting a lot of pressure on this new couple to move to their little town.  There are no jobs for my son in his field he would have work for his FIL. My DIL would stay home even though she has a promising new career in her field of study.  

When I say pressure they threatened to disown their daughter if she didn’t comply and force my son to do the same. 

She has cried at my house this weekend in fear they will follow through.  They have a house here, they would have to live with the parents if they moved. My son makes six figures and my DIL could be making six figures in two years. The pay cut would be massive and interrupting their careers would be professional suicide.  

Her parents also want them to have kids right away. Neither of them want that for at least 3 years maybe longer if her career takes off. 

I’ve always been a “I’ll catch you if you fall” kind of patent allowing my kids to make their own decisions after 16, but I feel like I need to step in.



Should I and my husband step in?  How can I comfort my DIL if her parents do disown her?"
TheGreatLandSquirrel,2021-04-18 17:48:58+00:00,No more Super Grover,"I love my kid to death. But she has this one toy that drives me absolutely up the walls. It's a sesame street Super Grover cell phone. She's got a few toy cell phone that make nosies and I have no problem with them. This one however has no on/off switch. And the battery compartment is screwed shut for safety purposes. It could be sitting on the table unbothered for hours and all the sudden it will make this obnoxious clinking sound over and over again followed by Grover saying some stuff about being a super hero, or just straight up screaming! What an awful toy!

So I finally reached my breaking point. When my daughter was asleep and it randomly started going off again I decided that was it, I'm getting rid of the damn thing! So like any dad would do, I threw it under the faucet. Yet it still was chattering away. So next I just threw it in an empty pitcher in the sink and filled it up with water. Ha! That aught to do it. I pulled it out and watched the water slowly drain out. To my surprise, it still worked. So I threw it back in the pitcher and left it there for the night. Today I woke up and did the dishes. I pulled Grover from his watery grave and pressed some buttons. No sounds! Yes, I did it. So in the trash he went. The kid wasn't quite awake yet so I decided to enjoy my quiet morning with some Ghost of Tsushima on the Playstation. 

I'm playing for a bit and all of the sudden I hear it. ""I HAVE GOT SUPER POWERS!"" I think to myself ""my God, he really is indestructible."" so at this point I've had enough. It's trash day tomorrow so in the bin he goes. That's the last I hope to ever hear from grover. If you don't hear from me though, it's likely that he came back to get his revenge."

tinymom7674,2021-04-18 17:32:32+00:00,How to handle other kids being rough at the park?,"So my husband and I try to take our daughter to the park on the weekends since he’s off from work then. We feel a little awkward at this park because most of the parents are “upper class”, so trying to mingle with them never really happens, but we manage with short greetings and that’s about it. 

The only real problem with these parents is that when they all get together at the park, and it’s usually a group of them that have brought their kids, they completely ignore their children and mingle with the other parents. I often times find myself having to as politely as possible tell another child to wait for my daughter to slide first, or ask another child to please not push my daughter out of the way. Sometimes a mom or dad comes rushing over and apologizes, but usually they glare up at me, the only mom on the equipment (by request of my daughter) or look really scared if it’s my husband (he’s heavily tattooed and muscular and does not fit in the with the other dads). 

Every time we go we never stay as long as we intend because no one is ever watching their kids and we don’t want to have to keep policing our daughter. She gets frustrated, we get frustrated, and the other parents don’t even know what’s happening. Today specifically, our daughter kept trying to slide and this older child kept climbing up the slide at the same time. No problem with climbing up, we let her do it, but he kept doing it every time she wanted to slide. Finally my husband was like, “Hey kid. Will you let my daughter slide?” The mother FINALLY noticed and didn’t really do anything the next five times he did it except tell him “No Jack!” It’s like at what point do you actually step in and say, “Hey, can you do something about your kid? There’s a million other places he could climb and slide and swing but he’s specifically not letting my daughter slide.” We don’t want to do this so we just end up leaving. 

How do you guys handle this without coming off as rude? I’m tired of looking around at the other mom just sipping their lattes and flapping their lips while their kid is barging in front of mine or screaming for their own mom to come help them."
BocceBurger,2021-04-18 17:18:52+00:00,My husband and I are at odds regarding the covid vaccine for our kid,"I (40F) was on the fence for a long time, and I finally swung to the pro vaccine side. He (41M) was thrilled, because he has always been pro vaccine. I signed us both up and we were waiting for a scheduling call for our shots. 

Then the news about blood clots came out and I got scared again. For history, I got a pulmonary embolism from a blood clot and almost died at age 34, no answer to why it happened. So I became fearful and back on the fence. I was still leaning towards yes, because my husband was so insistant that it was media hype and not a real concern.

Then I took our healthy 5 year old dog for routine vaccinations and had a (admittedly very rare) vaccine reaction (called IMHA) and after a $9000 stay in intensive care she died.

The following week the news reports that the J&amp;J vaccine is possibly causing clots. 

Two weeks go by, and we get our notices for our vaccine appointments. He's thrilled, and I canceled mine. He thinks I'm foolish, he says the clot thing is still just media hype. He says our dog's rare reaction should have no bearing on my decision to get a vaccine.

And then I tell him that I won't be having our child vaccinated either. She's not eligible yet, she's 11, but soon it will be available and I won't be taking her. I can't do it. I took my healthy dog and killed her with a vaccine. I can't risk it with my kid. He is so mad he wouldn't even talk, he walked away and went to work. I'm not sure how to proceed.

Parents of reddit, will you be vaccinating your children? Am I foolish in deciding this for my kid? Also, my kid wants the vaccine. She's aware the risks and she knows what happened to our dog. But, like, she's a child. Medical decisions are not hers to make. Right? How do we, as parents, make these choices and know we aren't damaging them or setting them up for future damage? I'm so lost and sad and torn. I miss my dog. I don't want to lose my kid. She's the only one I have, and she's precious, and irreplaceable, and covid isn't killing children is it? Or is it? I can't ever be sure if I'm reading real news or fake news, I don't ever know what to think. This is the hardest decision I've ever had to make. I'm terrified."
lindseydrums,2021-04-18 16:59:40+00:00,What is happening with my sons sleep?,"So my son is almost 10 months old. His morning nap usually happens fine with little protest and he's on a regular food schedule. 

His afternoon nap has been harder to get him down for, and sometimes he pushes it until after dinner. We'll let him sleep for an hour at most if that happens to keep him on schedule. He always naps in his crib. 

He is usually asleep around 8:30-9 pm and is very tired. He doesn't nap more than 3 hours during the day. 

The problem has been that he's waking up 2-3 times a night now and doesn't want to be put down. Sometimes he wants a bottle, but most of the time he falls right back asleep when we pick him up out of his crib. 

I thought we were out of the 8 month sleep regression. He was getting all 4 of his top teeth, but they have all broken through the gums. 

After a long 6 weeks of waking up through the 8 month sleep regression and now these couple weeks of multiple wake ups after one week of good sleep, my husband and I are really feeling the effects.

Obstacle616,2021-04-18 13:35:45+00:00,Am I in the wrong for being annoyed??,"In the home there is my partner, my stepdaughter 6 almost 7(SD) and I. I've raised her since she was about 2 1/2 and my partner wants me to be actively involved.

We keep having a couple of recurring issues and one of them is just something I'm struggling to do. 

We keep having issues with SD lying about things. I get all children do this and go through phases of it but with our situation and with issues with my partner's ex we're really trying to instill in her how important it is to tell the truth. 

There's been a few instances lately where I have seen SD doing something that she's not supposed to and she just turned around and says she didn't do it. This has caused issues with me and my partner as I'm saying SD should have a consequence for not doing as she's told and my partner takes SDs side which obviously causes more friction as SD has not done as she's told and is now lying on top of this and it has led to some heated arguments.  

Fast forward today and this happens again in the usual way but I manage to proove to my partner that what SD is saying isn't true and when my partner talks to her she admits she was lying. My partner got really annoyed at SD and told her off and told her she couldn't have the tablet for the next few days. 

Where I'm really struggling with this is literally 5 minutes after this SD is back to laughing and giggling and asking for a movie or to do other things. With the amount of trouble these lies are causing I find it hard to want to go back to laughing and giggling and wanting to do nice things so quickly. 

My partner says I'm in the wrong and I shouldn't be annoyed and should just let it go and kids do just go back that quickly. I'm not wanting to keep these things going but I find it hard to move on and stop being annoyed at SD for causing what are becoming quite serious  problems. 

Is it normal for a child to just move on from being told off? How do I let go of being annoyed so quickly? 

Any advice or experience would be really appreciated right now."

I'm jumping right into my early morning thoughts that are currently keeping me awake for the past 2 hours.

I'm pregnant with our first. We have a 3 bedroom house. Attic but can't use it, no basement (Texas). We have a garage, two cars parked in there currently and a backyard (mostly unused, we just moved here), expansion of house not possible. Husband and I have bedroom (room #1) that we share and a hobby room (room #2 aka. His office, my sewing room). We are expecting a boy early summer, his nursery is ready for use (room#3). 

We are planning on another child after this one. If it's a girl, they both will need separate rooms (or won't they?). If it's a boy, he might be able to stay with his older brother in the same room, just not sure how soon they can be together in the same room (Another early morning thought) . 

If separate rooms, we will be missing a hobby/office room. Also, we'll be missing extra space to sleep for guests (we only have them over once/twice a year) and extra space for storage space. 

How would you manage following:
2 adults with hobbies 
2 children 
Guests that stay the night for 2 weeks in a row
A noisy living room (vent/air-conditioning noise)

Delimadeluxe,2021-04-18 10:02:41+00:00,Is this sleep regression?,"Hey Reddit!!

My son is soon to be 4 months. 
Sleeping was horrible when he was newborn. Lots of stomach problems, didn’t sleep at night, I was sleeping 1 hour every 24 hours as I was so worried about him and had these crazy nights! 

Around 2 months he started to get into a rythm. Untill some days ago he had normal naps during the day and fell asleep between 7pm and 10pm (19.00 and 22.00), woke up to feed 2-3 times during the night and was awake/ready to party between 7am and 8am (07.00-08.00). Wonderful. 

But some days ago he started being problematic. Sleeping maybe 30 minutes from 8pm to 8.30pm and then wake up and crying if he wasnt in my arms. For the last 3 days i have been carying him around until my arms fall off almost until midnigt before he settles. 

Note: he has been struggling a bit with a cold so he is coughing a bit, sneezing often and sometimes has a blocked nose when he lays down. No fever. He is fine during the day though, smiling, laughing, talking with us, improving his tummy time by stretching his arms so he reaches higher with his upper body, breastfeeds, naps etc... 

Is this sleep regression or could it be the cold?

My five month old has been going through a bit of a sleep regression lately, but I noticed that every time he wakes up, about every 3 hours, he is absolutely ravenous. He now is eating way more than he used to, and I am wondering what is going on. He is breastfed and then supplemented with a bottle (also with breast milk). He used to eat about 5 times a day, but now he is waking very hungry an additional two to three times at night to eat. We noticed last week that he was still appearing a little hungry after his usual daytime feedings, so our doctor recommended we start with a couple tablespoons of solids a day. But this does not appear to be helping as he now is waking up to eat all night long. Is it just part of a growth spurt or should we up his food intake during the day? It just seems that he already is eating so much...about 5 oz each feeding already and one time he was super hungry I gave him 6 oz, but that ended up with a ton of spit up. Sorry if this is a silly question, first time mom trying to figure it all out ha! I just don’t want to accidentally over feed him. Thanks!"

So, as it says above my 6 year old daughter L is asking questions about different ethnicities etc. For context, we're waiting for neurodevelopment to assess her as it's highly suspected that she has autism though we're not quite sure where she is on the scale yet. All of our family is white. We live in the UK in a fairly rural area. My school was entirely white, so was my secondary school. 

My attitude towards this and any other questions brought up is the standard ""differences make people unique and everyone should be treated with respect regardless of those differences"", but the difficulty here is that she often says exactly what pops into her brain because that's just how she works.

I need advice on how I can appropriately phrase answers to questions she has, and how I can avoid her accidentally being racist to other children in her class. I wouldn't want her to upset another child, and of course neither would she. She's a very sensitive kid and gets very emotional if she thinks she's upset someone.

For example, on Friday she asked me why one of the children in her class, K, had black skin. I sat her down and talked about skin colour like it was hair colour, it was the only thing I could think to say, and I didn't want to leave her for a few minutes while I googled an appropriate response because she would have completely forgotten about it. This has been on my mind all weekend, I'm wondering if I answered her appropriately or if I could have handled it a different way.

He seems to like the idea, but I think he don't want to be so enthusiastic about it due to what we had planned before, and he is afraid I'll get over-worked, also we don't really know anyone who is doing something similar. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Does it worked for you? I would be happy if someone have any input to share."
110069,2021-04-18 05:53:22+00:00,Nap advice 2.5 years old,"So my toddler has been slowing down on naps for about 3 months now. Recently she mostly stopped napping for a few weeks (maybe 1-3 naps a week depending). Then she went back to napping for a week and now maybe back to no naps. If she naps (only about an hour) she takes over 2 hours to get to sleep but if she doesn’t she is oddly quiet, distracted, and is a bit more irritable from about 2pm. I’m not sure what to do... it seems like she needs a nap but over 2 hours to fall asleep is crazy. We tried napping 2 days a week but on those nap days it took her a long time to fall asleep again. If she naps (down at 12:30 and asleep by 1) her bedtime is 7 and if she doesn’t then 6-6:30. Weekday wake ups has to be 6:15am so if she takes too long to fall asleep she looses a ton of sleep."
BlitzAtk,2021-04-18 05:52:56+00:00,"Can't follow, won't follow (YouTubers), but make your path for your little ones to follow.","Hello,

I can't remember if it was on their subreddit or on other that I posted a question about how prominent people with established careers become so successful when they actually have the same set of responsibilities. They may have one or two kids, a spouse who is stay at home or they work full-time.

I recently came across a Youtuber who shared his time management in being a doctor, Youtuber, and social media fanatic (here's the link: https://youtu.be/5Nin1OtjOlU). At first I was wowed, but my always hones in on the their left hand, do they have a ring. Are they married or previously married? Do they have kids?

The reason I made this post as a question was to ask how many of you parents out there feel the same way I do and somewhat disgusted by people whole have challenging lives, manages 10 thousand things, yet married life with kids isn't one of the tasks. They go out and encourage people to strive, achieve, aim, be productive, when they don't understand a single bit about parenting.

Now, I know, I don't have to follow and I won't follow (hense the title). It doesn't apply to my life. Course you would also counter my post with, ""well, perhaps that isn't what he/she is aiming at (parents)"", or ""you could simply ignore them"", or "" who gives a f#@k, people can do and share whatever they want, your post is irrelevant!"". 🤣 My point is this, yes, we have the choice to choose what we consume, but I fear some parents fall in the trappings of such YouTubers who boast about how to do more in life, without knowing anything about parenting. 

Please don't see this post as a negative at first. All I want to say in the end is that I am a proud parent and that I understand, to a certain extent, the real struggles of parents out there. It's hard. There wi be days that suck, yet there are days you will never forget. I'm proud of you are who are toughing it out especially during this time with the pandemic. Just remember to carve out some time for yourself to recharge. It is very important that you do that. 5-10 to breath some fresh air from an open window or the back door to your porch. 

Please takecare of yourself. The little ones we look after are not just yours and my future, it is all of our futures. They need us at of it best, because we will need them at our worst. When my son (turning 3 soon), sees me stressed or weeps (yeah dad here), he literally comes and hugs and gives me a kiss on the cheek. ❤️😌🙏 

Thank your for reading. Be well and stay safe.

lammisam,2021-04-18 05:46:58+00:00,"I (20F) am getting a kitten next month, but my parents told me no more cats... help!","I am currently a junior at a university  (20F) and I live in an apartment off campus with some roommates. We’re all just bored, Zoom students trying to survive COVID. I’ve been feeling the quarantine blues and have been thinking about getting a kitten for a while now. 

Whenever I’m at my apartment, no matter how I spend my time, I feel like something is missing and I think it’s the presence of a pet. I also really like the responsibility and accountability a pet holds over you. I’ve had a cat my whole life, and I currently have a family cat at home that my parents call “my cat”. My mom is insistent I take him to our new larger rental home that we move into next month. The only issue with this is my dad LOVES my cat too and doesn’t want to displace him from the family home because that’s where he grew up. My family cat, Walnut, is my baby and I’ll take him when my parents decide to move. I don’t think that’s any time soon though. 

Randomly browsing the internet one day, ;) , I happened upon a woman on Facebook who said her cat was pregnant and about to pop any second, so I messaged her and got a spot in line impulsively... The only problem is my parents have strictly told me NO more cats, but IMO this would be a really good thing for me and for Walnut. My parents have overfed my precious Wally to a 25 lb chonk and he desperately needs to lose weight. I want to take him, put him on a strict diet, and raise him with another cat so hopefully he loses weight because he’s only three years old and needs more mental stimulation! I’ll probably be allowed to take him to my new place in the winter so I will have time to get the two cats friendly with each other. Walnut is friends with the neighbor cats so I have no doubt he’d like a buddy to keep him company. He tries to interact with my dog too but he plays too rough for her and she does not put up with him. 

How do I break it to my parents I’m getting a kitten when they’ve made it very clear I’m “not allowed to?” I’m 20 years old and I have more than enough money saved to provide for this cat on my own. I don’t even live with them anymore and I don’t plan on ever moving back in. Any advice would be appreciated! 

TLDR ...
I am getting a kitten against my parents wishes. I am 20, and don’t know how to break it to them because they specifically told me no, but I don’t even live with them?"
pupablyszczaca,2021-04-18 05:31:25+00:00,Back pain worse at night,My 8 year old daughter started complaining of back pain (between her shoulder blades). Usually at bedtime. She says its not severe and responds well to pain relief. I'm taking her to drs tomorrow morning but I'm freaking out. Google brings up some scary results. Anyone's child went through anything similar?
jt470000,2021-04-18 03:55:15+00:00,How do you get a 4 year old to listen to you?,"How do you get a 4 year old to listen to you? My son is 4 and he struggles with listening. This scares me because even things that have to do with safety goes in one ear and out the other. Like “get out of the street!” If he walks into the street in front of our house.

My wife and I are really struggling with this. I want to teach him life’s lessons as his father but the fact I can tell him anything or show him anything and he won’t listen ie. Therefore he does not learn.

Do any of you parents have any tricks or anything that was a game changer to your 4 or 5 year old or is this pretty normal for that age?

Also we take away all kinds of things, toys, iPad, etc when it comes to this and still he continues to do it.

Thx everyone for the help."
thingstodoinjersey,2021-04-18 03:46:40+00:00,Never Ending Nanny Issues!,"This is for parents who have experience with private nannies. As much as I hate it, I need help with childcare. I have a large family (including 3 littles who are not even school age yet), run a full time business, and my coparent travels for work about 70% of the year. I need the backup person to ensure my children are all getting the support and attention they need. 

My dream would be to find a long term nanny who would feel like a part of the family. We offer great pay and benefits (paid vacation, holiday bonus, double pay for any last minute or weekend shifts, lunches paid for, and more), and I do everything I can to make our home a positive work environment for them. 

No matter what I do, I keep getting the bad seeds. If you can think of a possible nanny problem, I have had it. I caught one sleeping when she was supposed to be watching my children. I’ve had to deal with caregivers ignoring the kids and scrolling their phone all day. More than once, I’ve had nannies who treat this like a volunteer position where they sort of just let me know when they’re going to show up. 

So, this is half rant and half plea for advice. If you’ve had success in developing a long-term relationship with a great nanny, how did you find them? What’s your screening process like? What do you offer to keep the good ones on board? Any guidance would be appreciated. 

I’m at my wit’s end, and I’m feeling so so guilty about the turnover my little ones are having to put up with. 

Thanks in advance. :)"
vvllll,2021-04-18 03:19:50+00:00,16 y/o is completely off the rails and does not respond to normal discipline,"I've had legal custody of my sixteen year old brother for a little over a year now. I've been responsible for him unofficially since he was a newborn, so this is not a new arrangement; it just happens to be the first period in our lives where the agreement has been on paper. In all but name, I am his parent. But I've never felt more at my wit's end raising him than I do right now. 

My brother was sexually exploited as a small child and it recently emerged that he has been abused repeatedly as an adolescent as well. This happened when he was in my care. I'm a failure as a parent and I know it, but I will do anything to pull this back and make it right. I cannot understand how I missed this, or how I could have failed him to this extent. I made efforts to search his devices wherever possible and took steps to discern where he has been going, and who he has been going out with, but it wasn't enough and I haven't been able to protect him. It has come as a shock; I thought we both were coping despite previous setbacks and our current arrangement was working for both of us.

He has grappled with depression and did have a slight relapse before Christmas; I believed substance abuse was to blame at the time. Aside from this, I presumed we were coping very well. We've been working alongside his social worker, he is in therapy, and generally, he has appeared more comfortable in himself. He has been managing his temper considerably well. He appeared to be dealing with the abuse coming to light with resilience. He cooperated with the police in giving an account of the abuse, and readily surrendered his devices. He has been attending therapy without arguments. He has been communicating with me when he felt overwhelmed. 

However, since returning to school almost two weeks ago, we've fought daily. He was attending online classes due to the pandemic, and he just returned to face-to-face learning. He performs adequately at school when he applies himself, but homework is a consistent battle. He insists that he'll finish it later, but later never comes. His workload got on top of him during online schooling and he has more to catch up on than he thought; yet he prioritises going out with friends, gaming, texting, or getting high. I have done everything in my power to counter this but it really is beyond my control at this stage, and considering the bigger picture, it seems petty that homework is the catalyst for our major disputes lately. 

As I type, he is spending the night at a friend's house having stormed out, again. I don't know which friend. I don't know where. I don't know what he is doing. He refuses to answer the phone or respond to texts. I called his social worker at 11; this is the agreed upon procedure when he violates curfew. Every time he fails to return home, they tell me they'll check back in the morning, and suggest I call the police if I can't make contact. 

But then what? He's sixteen and almost my size now. I can't restrain him. I can't force him to stay in the house. I can't force him to do anything, and I don't want to force him, I want to communicate with him. I can search his room, I can confiscate drugs, I can search his devices, I can switch off the WiFi when it's time to work or sleep. But it all infuriates him and he'll leave the house in a rage. Then I'll sit up all night sick to my stomach until I know he's alright. If I call the police, I know he might get confrontational with them and risk arrest. It wouldn't be the first time he's gotten into trouble.

He was sneaking out of our Father's house at night when he was twelve years old, and I've done all I can to combat it over the years. It was easy when he was small enough that I could put my arms around him and talk until he calmed down, but that really isn't an option anymore. 

I can't spend another night sitting up in fear that I'll get a phone call saying something has happened to him. I've been sick with stress and I'm starting to feel constantly unwell. My heartbeat is consistently irregular and I'm not even in my thirties. I love my brother more than life itself. I adore him. But I can't keep this up. I'm not enough for him, and I feel his issues are beyond my capabilities. I am terrified something will happen to him and I'll not be able to live with myself if it does. 

There are more concerns - I'm troubled about the material he consumes on the internet, for one. And both of our parents are attempting to re-establish contact with him. Both were abusive and the reason he is in my care. Our Father will likely be taking us to court for custody again soon. But these are problems I can't begin to tackle tonight. I'm overwhelmed - there are too many obstacles with this boy. I have two years left in which time I can legally do something to help him, but that time is running out fast. I love him deeply, but I feel out of my depth. He is completely off the rails, and I have no idea what to do. I've been parenting him since I was a child myself and I need help. Last time he was in foster care he felt rejected and our relationship was strained for months, but I feel I can't cope much longer, particularly if we keep taking these steps backwards in progress. 

What can I do? How can I help him? How can I establish normal boundaries when he has endured pain that is so beyond normal? He's a good kid when he isn't aggressive - he is thoughtful, kind, funny, intelligent, and deeply sensitive. I love him more than I've loved anyone or anything else in this life, but I can't continue like this."
LadyArty19,2021-04-18 03:16:49+00:00,Already worried &amp; we’re not even trying for baby #2 yet,"So one of my best talents is worrying about things I can’t control and stressing over future events that haven’t even happened yet. Yay me lol. Our daughter is almost 10mo and me and my husband know we want another child—we may start trying by next year at the earliest. I clearly enjoy motherhood enough to want another baby, but I’m already scared of how much more tired and overwhelmed I’ll be. I’m home with our daughter but I also work from home, so I’m nonstop all day long, and most days I’m pretty wiped out (mostly from work demands) and kinda testy to be honest. I remember how angry, exhausted and overwhelmed I was during our daughter’s first 3 months, and all I can think is, “If I was THAT burnt out, how will we survive with two?” I know there is zero reason for me to be worrying about it already, but I can’t help myself. If you have some words of wisdom or encouragement, please share. ❤️"
FancyPantsMead,2021-04-18 02:56:31+00:00,I feel I'm failing my son!,"My son is 15 and he's the sweetest kid. He's smart as hell. He's book smart, he's got some common sense, has a very good grasp on right and wrong, and empathy for others and helpful spirit. How am I failing him? 

To me it seems like he's so far behind in life skills. I hate that he has no drive to take care of his surroundings, he doesn't do his own laundry, doesn't do a full chore, doesn't cook, doesn't follow multi-step directions and has no umph to start things on his own. 

He's got chronic migraine just like me (I'm actually fully disabled because of how bad and frequent mine are and a severely bad back)  and there is definitely moments where I feel he takes advantage of it. 

He has excused absences at school. Because the number of days he's struck with them adds up to more then the 10 days he's allowed to miss per semester. He's still an A and B student. He makes his work up right away he doesn't bother the teachers by missing assignments or interrupting class to get caught up.

 He hates school with a passion. He hates the other students who he finds very immature and childish. He hates two of his teachers because they have said to him infront of the whole class ""oh my god (my son) has made it to school for a whole week in a row."" And make snide comments to him when he gets his make up stuff from them.


 Honestly it's the exact same shit I got from the teachers when I was going through school. I was top 10 in my class with honor classes, graduated early, and got scholarships and those jerks said the same thing to me. I had no parents to help me navigate the medical hell I was dealing with because I just wasn't that important to them.  I had to deal with it all myself. But I did.  

Now that my son is dealing with the same problems he is not going through it alone and I'm constantly involved. I chewed the teachers out hard and the staff but the damage is already done. Those teachers are jerks to him with passive agressive behavior.  My son has a 504 plan filed with the school. The only accomodations he requires is his attendance so I don't get thrown in jail for his absences. That's it. But it makes him hate school even more. 

He gets so upset if he doesn't do well on a test. He hates failure and when it happens he feels like it's anything and everyone fault but his own. Sometimes you have to study to get the grade. That's ok. But he's so used to everything coming natural to him and doesn't handle failure well. But in private. He doesn't make a scene infront of others. 

I feel like I haven't prepared him for the no's in life. How to get over adversity because he's never had any. I was/am so focused on giving him a better life then I had that I've never let him fail and figure it out on his own. And it's definitely time for him to start doing things like that. Watching him struggle with something because I've been doing it for him is killing me. Watching him fail at things he should have mastered long ago makes me feel like a complete failure.

My husband was raised the same way as our son and when we started dating and got married it astounded me the amount of life skills he just didn't have. My husband is 6 yrs older then me. My husband's attitude towards these things is that ""he'll figure it out!"" After all husband did.  So my husband's not worried about it at all, while I am constantly worried about how I messed this up for him. 

My husband just told me tonight while he and I were discussing it ""Wife, you've been a 35 yr old woman since you were 8, because you had to be. You had it all figured out for so long because no one took that burden off you and allowed you to be a kid, or a teenager. You've been a parent to your 3 siblings, made sure they were safe and cared for and didn't let anyone give them the same treatment as you. They turned out great. They got it. Even when you did more for them then you should have. They are well adjusted adults with good lives, yes they had times when they needed your help but that's what parents are for and that's what you are to them. Do you really think our son would have anything less in life with you as his mother? You're doing great. He's just being a teenager with a little too much chill. There is still time for him to learn the things you're scared he's lacking. He's got this. You've got him. He's gonna get it."" 


Honestly that was the nicest thing I've heard in a long time and didn't realize I'm not the only who thinks about his future. Who wants the best for him. With my chronic migraines I miss so much. So many things have to be canceled, or adjusted, or seriously thought out ahead of time. It's not that way for everyone and the amount of stress I have about life are very specific to my personal experiences. While my son may have some of my struggles he has so much more help and skills to deal with it then I did then. I need to help him but not overwhelm him, so he will get it too. It's just so hard to watch and not do. 

I love my son and husband so much and I only want the best possible life for them. All the things I never had, all the love and attention I was never shown and all the good things I never got. But, that looks very different from what I was thinking was lacking."
BooBooBaggins1218,2021-04-18 02:33:01+00:00,Need advice from parents,"My niece who is 5, stole a $20 bill from her dad. I was watching her tonight. She tried to give me the $20 and said it was from the tooth fairy. I waited for her little sister to go to bed and then interrogated her. After several attempts to lie she finally confessed it was from her dad’s wallet. 
Her life has been somewhat tough. Her mom is out of the picture and her step mom is very strict. Punishment lasts for a long time (nothing abusive just long times with out treats or privileges while seeing her sister get them). She begged me not to tell. I said yes but told her over and over again to never do that. The way she felt guilt all day would be 10x as bad if she did.

SarahHudson_8389211,2021-04-18 02:04:55+00:00,Son wears nappies and has been acting like a baby. Why?,"I recently discovered adult nappies under my 17 year old sons bed when I went in his room to help find his phone (with permission). Next to the nappies was a small box that contained 3 adult pacifiers, a stuffed animal, and a sippy cup. 
I was obviously rather worried and so I called my son into the room. He came to the doorway and turned completely white and began to tear up. Which is strange considering he has never been much of a crier. I assured him I wasn’t mad and and asked what the stuff was for and why he had it. I had thought it was perhaps a kink thing but he denied that rather forcefully.

He told me that sometimes, when he is particularly stressed or overtired, he has trouble staying in an “adult” mindset and that it’s easier to slip into a younger one because he doesn’t have anything to worry about when he’s in a younger mindset. But he also told me that he usually doesn’t want to slip and that it’s simply involuntary, which is what really worried me. He said he’ll try to fight it. I have no idea what to do with this information. As far as I’m aware, there’s no major life changes that are particularly stressful. His father had suggested that perhaps it was for attention, but we both love him very much and have always given him attention when he needed it. Nothing new at school either. 

This was about a week ago and since then we’ve noticed all the signs of a child in our son. Caught him with his thumb in his mouth several times, found him washing his sheets after wetting the bed, etc. He was always so independent before and now that we know his secret, he can be clingy and whiny. Is this a mental disorder? Should we get him to see a therapist? I have no idea what to do at this point. Pleas help!"
mcbw2019,2021-04-18 01:57:36+00:00,Spent the whole day cleaning and organizing my 2 year old’s bedroom.,"It desperately needed it! He has so many toys, baby clothes in tubs, baby toys he’s outgrown, etc. and it was a full day project to go everything I had crammed in his walk in closet. We are saving most everything in case we are fortunate enough to have a second baby, but it definitely adds to the clutter in the house! 

His room is tidy now, but I am sitting on the couch feeling lousy for a few reasons. I think it made me really sad to pack up his baby things, changing pad, baby toysc, etc. he’s 2...I’ve been delaying it lol. I also am bummed because I didn’t enjoy my day off with him by doing anything fun, and I really cherish these weekend days together. I was busy pretty much all day while he self entertained. I also feel guilty because I snapped at him for climbing all over all the stuff on the floor and standing on it while I was trying to clean this afternoon. He didn’t care a kept on playing, but I felt bad for losing my temper, especially when it wasn’t even his fault that the room was such a mess. I did apologize and give him a hug and a kiss! Now the whole house is a mess from the bedroom declutter (big family who won’t stop buying toys lol), but his room is nice and tidy, everything is accessible, and his toys can be rotated. We did still play a bit and he played a lot in his room while I did the organizing. 

Someone tell me I’ll be glad I spent today doing this chore! Right now I feel like it was just a kind of crummy day."

I like the idea of having children, when I was younger I always thought that’s something I’d like to do. But now as I approach the actual age to have kids, I’m less certain. 

I don’t like most children. I think they’re annoying. But I like the idea of having really young children, and then children who was old enough to be mature and bond with.  The in between scares me. Plus, a ton of kids have disciplinary issues with the newer generations being born in the modern technological world. Will my kids be ones I like? It’s supposed to be based on the parents, I know. But I’ve seen good parents get the raw end of the deal with children. 

I like having time to myself for my own hobbies. I like traveling with my partner. We have dogs, who also take up time and responsibilities. We do not have a lot of space in our home. We have family living with us and having a baby means they would have to leave. I don’t know how I feel about that either. I’m also worried about the supports we have in place with limited family. 

My partner really wants to have a baby. I want to make her happy and I like the idea of having a child. I think we need more space/money/time but don’t think those things are realistically changing within the next few years and the clock is ticking.

Is it weird to let him back on the breast and breastfeed again? I have given him a cup of expressed milk and of course he liked it and has made him want to more."
JMSidhe,2021-04-18 00:23:44+00:00,Single dad preparing for daughter's first period,"TL;DR - How can I best support my daughter during her first period?

I (M/29) have had custody of my kid (F/12) for ten years, she visits her mom on the weekends so it's a safe bet she'll be with me when she begins her first period. My nightmare is to be one of those awful parents who sends her alone into a pharmacy with $10, I've done my best to support her throughout her childhood and I want to continue to be someone she can lean on as she grows up. This is just the next challenge and I need to get out in front of it as best I can.

There aren't many other women in her life she could talk to besides my mother, and I don't know if that's a conversation they'd even be interested in trying. Either way it's not my mom's responsibility to talk to her granddaughter about these things. I know I'm working under a ticking clock and I want to be as supportive as I can. I want to see her pediatrician when it starts but I worry scheduling an appointment too soon would stress her out. She's slightly built (3'9"" and 62 pounds) and is a very soft kid who is scared of blood and broke down in tears when she learned she has to get vaccination shots this summer before starting middle school. Those are hurdles we'll have to work on.

I've begun my research and started making a shopping list, but still have a few questions. I'll try not to be too detailed. But I like making lists and plans. I keep an itinerary for vacations. Sorry in advance.

One book that's been highly recommended is ""The Care and Keeping of You 2: The Body Book for Older Girls,"" and I plan to order it, but I'd really appreciate any other reading materials to help both of us, but especially her considering it's her body going through these changes.

I've read that calcium and iron supplements can help in the days leading up to her period, and that painkillers like ibuprofen, paracetamol, and Modil can help with cramps pain (as opposed to Tylenol), but we'll be careful not to overuse them. Are there other pharmaceuticals I should stock up on? Dark chocolate is supposedly good for easing the pain, she loves it anyway so that's good, but if anyone can confirm or suggest other helpful snacks I'm all ears. We have a heating pad she sleeps on sometimes for comfort so that should help. I've seen a lot of references to keeping a hot water bottle but it's unclear to me what that's used for. What's up with the hot water bottle?

Padded period underwear is popular, with two brands mentioned a lot: Thinx and Bambody. But what are the pros/cons? Which would you recommend?

Knixteen overnight shorts and Kotex U overnight pads are both popular. Would it be overkill to use them together or is this an either/or situation? I put a plastic liner on her mattress already and I know how to remove bloodstains with hydrogen peroxide. Are pantyliners an overnight thing, and what brands are best?

I don't think she'll be ready for tampons but what do I know, I'm no expert. I have read that Platex Sport are best for kids her age but I'm open to suggestions. She goes swimming in our pool often during the summer, is that an issue? Can she swim with pads or do we need tampons?

Additionally, and this is more difficult: I know we'll have the safe sex and consent talk, but I don't know how to bring up that she is a product of two teenagers not practicing safe sex. I don't want her to think that she was an accident or unwanted. It feels like it will inevitably come up. It's something I plan to speak to a therapist about once I find one who accepts my insurance (among other personal issues) but in the meantime I have no idea how to discuss this. Any input would be appreciated.

Thank you for reading this far, that was a lot to spit out but I've been worrying about this lately and can't afford to procrastinate. I have to do right by my kid and I don't have enough answers right now to do that. Thank you for your help."
underwearfanatic,2021-04-18 00:05:15+00:00,Waking up a terrorist,"My daughter (3yr) has been a terrible sleeper both for naps and at night. Reports from daycare are that she naps well there.

On the weekends she pretty much refuses to nap. And when she finally crashes (on the couch) she sleeps for about 1hr.

However when she wakes up she is an absolute terrorist. Kicking, screaming, flailing, and crying. If you talk to her she screams louder. If you get near her then she will try to kick you.

Read online that it is because she will have low blood sugar upon waking. However when she wakes she is normally so irate that she wont eat. She does eat poorly at home (quantity and quality) as she pretty much refuses to eat in general.

camelCaseSpace,2021-04-17 23:57:40+00:00,Can somebody help me with the whole no spanking recommendations?,"I have read the research and have learned a lot about peaceful/positive parenting. But I feel as though I'm not convinced that it actually works.

And my group of friends I was one of the last children. And 5/8 of them don't spank and 3 of them do. And none of the kids who don't get spanked behave while all of the kids who do get spanked behave.

And I have tried it with my children also. We have not spanked them and they are very unruly. And this is just me venting my frustration about this. I feel like this research is like the research that says that you shouldn't stretch before you run. But as a collegiate athlete who ran track I stretched before I ran from middle school to my senior year in college and I was a dang good runner.

I'm at a loss here. I don't disbelieve the extremes that can come from spanking. But when I look at my kids and my friend's kids who don't spank I'm starting to believe that this is another extreme to not spank at all."
june_a,2021-04-17 23:53:52+00:00,Would it look weird if a couple offers to babysit other people's children for free?,"Me and my husband are thinking of becoming parents, but last time we interacted with a real human child was 10+ years ago. So we have no clue how it feels to be around a kid. We came up with an idea to try to work as babysitters on weekends, but do it for free, just to get some experience and figure out if we are able to handle a child.   
Now I'm wondering, wouldn't that look suspicious? Usually babysitters are students who need some extra money, and we both are in late 20s and working. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I'm afraid that people will think we are pedophiles or something of the kind and simply won't trust us with their children. 

So I have a question for parents: Would you even consider leaving a kid for a day with a young married couple, if they provide this explanation (that they want to get experience before having own children)? Or would you think it's too weird?"

I am the primary carer, and she stays with me.

My little girl is 18 month old, and is very inquisitive, positive, bright and just a joy to be around.

My ex is not the healthiest of people, and I am very worried he will inflict trauma (intentionally or otherwise) on the child. Of course, I can't prove any of this, and won't be able to while she's a child. But that's not really my question.

My question and hope for guidance, is that I am thinking of not working for a year, at least until she's 3 years old, and starts talking and understanding things. 

During her entire childhood thus far, I was made to not work, to be a stay at home mom, and forsake my career and everything which made me me.

However, I have just been offered a $80,000 a year job at a tech company.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I take the job, see my child less, or should I not work for another year, and focus fully on her development?

Any advice?"
Atticus1981,2021-04-17 23:14:59+00:00,Parenting My Bipolar Mom,"I’ve been involuntarily parenting my mom since I was about 12 or so. I’m now 40. Today is a hard day. She gets manic. Sometimes the highs send her into aggressive self harming mode. The really fun part is that she will engage in risky behavior that eventually includes doing meth which negates her medication, then she will spiral into a dark place where she bangs her head into walls, sliding glass doors and onto concrete flooring, etc.. Like a self destructing zombie of some sort. The next turn in this cycle is that she genuinely seems to believe someone else has harmed her. So she will accuse (nurses, police, doctors, family members, friends, strangers) of inflicting injury on her.   She is actually the aggressor. She physically assaults anyone around. I moved far away, long ago, but still text and talk. Right now she has spiraled all the way into the self harm and accusation part. She tried to get my brother arrested today after he found her with a head injury... but she ended up assaulting the police. Now I’m praying she ends up at the hospital for a little regulation. Also that her eight small dogs that she keeps letting run free near the highway survive this episode. It’s basically like parenting a very unstable teen going through their darkest hardest part of life... but forever.. When she is like this I get physically ill and can’t really function. Not only am I triggered about past trauma when she is like this, I just feel so helpless. Note: all I can do is call for a police well check and let her doctor know what’s going on. And put my phone on silent as her texts and calls about the rapture and other wildly delusional things pour in hour after hour."

We have tried famotadine. We have tried nutramigen. We got the Dr. Browns bottles. 

Now we are on Puramino formula (2 weeks ago) and have just started lansoprazole (day 3 so far). There was a slight improvement when we started Puramino 2 weeks back but now we are back to bad news baby. Constant straining, flexing, back arching, grunting...never sleeps. Best sleep shes had is 3 hours. It was a miracle. Typically 1 hr max sleeps. Never sleeps during day. But the thing is she doesn't vomit or spit up which I hear is a clear sign of reflux. Also there's no blood or mucus in her stool so dairy allergy is not definite. So many questions about what's wrong its driving me nuts. Is it just bad gas?? All the time?????

My daughter (9) has pretty severe anxiety and is likely ASD. She doesn't generally like thrills and gets trepidatious see at the idea of being pushed too high on the swing. As a parent, I feel like it's my responsibility to push her boundaries in a safe way without making her feel uncomfortable.

I'm sure you've all heard about the idea of [safe words](https://youtu.be/QxCpBSDiPNc), but there's a really cool age appropriate version many aren't familiar with. The aptly named ""stoplight"" system is very easy for young ones to understand and express their needs quickly and in language they understand. **Green** means ""I'm having fun, don't stop"", **Yellow** means ""In not ready to stop, but I'm uncomfortable"", and **Red** means ""I need to stop right now"". The most important part of the stoplight system is that it creates a constant line of communication so you can keep a gauge of each other's mental state, which builds trust and rapport.

I taught her the stoplight system while pushing her on the swing. She was able to communicate with me through greens and yellows when she was feeling uncomfortable and when she wanted to be pushed higher. For the first time in her entire life I was able to build enough confidence in her to push her so high that her butt left the seat, and I was rewarded with the biggest, heartiest giggles ever."
MEd_Mama_,2021-04-17 22:10:54+00:00,How did your baby transition completely to solids?,"TL;DR- can you walk me through how your baby transitioned completely to solids?

My 8 month old son is eating about 2-3 servings of solids a day, in addition to about 2-3 breast milk feedings or bottles. I’ve done a lot of research and I know that breast milk should continue to be a part of his diet until he is 1, but I am struggling. He prefers solids over breast milk and is slowly but surely starting to refuse the breast. 

I am conflicted because I know that he needs to eat solids to get experience with them and also because breast milk no longer provides all the nutrients he needs. Based on this, I don’t want to take out the solids. However, I also don’t want to transition him all the way to solids because he is not yet 1 year. An added problem is that my milk supply is starting to go down because I’m not nursing as much as I used to, but I can’t really pump easily at my job (I’m a teacher). I don’t think that low supply is why baby is refusing the breast because he also is refusing full bottles as well. 

Most of what I’ve researched has just been “oh baby should drink this much milk and have this many servings of food” but nothing I can find really explains HOW the transition from milk to solids works or WHAT that can potentially look like. Plus... I’m a FTM so I am already kind of clueless. 

Hence, I’m turning to this great community. What did the transition from milk to only solids look like for you? What do you recommend? I will ask baby’s pediatrician at his 9 month appointment, but I wanted to see what you all thought first. 

Thanks in advance all you wonderful parents!"

... Until we found a hack, a very weird way to embrace the « no » and take its power away!! 

It works every single time, and has for a solid month and a half, so I’m sharing in case anyone else’s kid came with that software patch as well. It goes like this: 

Us: Hey kiddo! It’s time to change your dia-

The Antagonist: no!

Us: it’s time to change your diape-no! Let’s go to your room-no! togeth-no! 


*surprised confusion, met by us looking at him like we just said something completely normal*


The Antagonist: let’s go-no! 
*walks to his room merrily*

We keep it up until he’s laughing and collaborates, sometimes as long as it takes to take off his pants-no! and remov-no! his diape-no! but it works. 

And, more than anything else, it turns potential frustration into silliness, which is a win in our book. :)

This is all normal and sane, right?"

We tried famotadine and got off breastmilk. Initially that helped a bit but shes now become worse. Currently we are on Puramino formula (for 2 weeks now)and she's been taking Lansoprazole for 3 days now. Still no improvement...yet.

We are at our wits end as to what is going on with her. Here are some symptoms:

- Constant squirming, flexing, straining, back arching
- Has trouble burping
- Does not sleep well at all. Our best has been 3 hours. Typically 1 hour. Does not sleep during day
- no spit up or vomit
- lots of crying
- needs to be held constantly
- prefers belly laying vs. Back

My wife is grasping to hope that it isn't reflux as she misses breastfeeding dearly. I am pretty sure its some sort of allergy or reflux...or something! Lack of sleep plus not knowing what's wrong is driving us mad.

volderpuss,2021-04-17 21:23:54+00:00,Montessori made me feel like my 2 year old needs interventions.,"My 27 month old daughter started Montessori this week. She was in in-home daycare before that but when the school told us they had a spot open in their 2 year old classroom we jumped on it. We got an update call the first day, Monday, to let us know she was having trouble being redirected and would scream and cry when told to stop doing something. Tuesday wasn’t much better, the teacher said she “only cried when I told her not to climb under the slide”. Wednesday she bumped her head on a shelf. Thursday, she played in the toilet and got pee on her (she has NEVER shown interest in playing in the toilet at home). We’ve been working on stopping the screaming behavior (we chalked it up to typical 2 year old boundary pushing) at home. We also have tried putting away a lot of her toys and leaving a few out only. 

We had an update meeting on Friday. The director and teacher mentioned they have to tail her to make sure she’s listening to directions and not climbing on stuff. I feel like they pretty much told me I have a child raised by wolves, and I must be seeing something completely opposite at home? I also feel like they wanted me to have her completely ready for some school setting before she even got into the school, as if I was supposed to emulate it at home? We’ve adopted the Montessori approach, maybe not to a T like they do at school but it honestly felt like they had “BEHAVIORAL EVALUATIONS” on the tip of their tongue. She’s 2. NEWLY 2. Did I miss some crucial teaching moments or are these some kind of unrealistic expectations for a child in their first week of school?"

When I asked my wife if she feels the same, she thought I was joking and laughed. When I said I wasn't joking, she laughed harder. When she sees me looking at them like this, she laughs after she sees whether they are going to confess doing something or not. With time I also started laughing, but still have this weird feeling.

Curiously enough, one of them came to me once and asked ""why mom laughs so much?"".

She has really excelled and is amazing at gymnastics(her class is full of kids who are 8-10 and she’s hands down the best). Anyways where she goes to gymnastics now they don’t do competitive and it’s more for fun and learning basics. She basically has outgrown the program.

Anyways I don’t want to miss a great opportunity but I want to make sure I don’t over stress her or have her hurt herself. She really wants to do it though. Thanks for advice!"
peepeepoopoobutt123,2021-04-17 18:52:20+00:00,"12 year old is a giant slob, is this normal?","Like we keep trying to enforce cleanliness - we set examples, have clean day, make him clean his room, do chores like take the trash out.  

However the degree of sloppiness is just insane if we don’t constantly monitor him (like legit have to check his room weekly).  Like we have found chewed up gum in random crevices in the apartment, not even wrapped up.  He refuses to throw his clothes in the hamper even though we put a hamper right in his room.  Like he throws it RIGHT NEXT to it??  There is also food wrappers in his room and old half eaten food.

Is this just normal 12 year old behavior?  I don’t recall being this lazy/sloppy at that age.  It’s just mentally exhausting that we give him rules like no snacks in the room and he just sneaks them in there.

He spends half the time at his moms if that matters."
cibman,2021-04-17 18:50:57+00:00,"Just a rant, “shame on you!”","Just a rant because the horse has already left the barn on this one.

We have my MIL being a granny nanny (something that I was worried about) and one day she said “shame on you!” when our daughter misbehaved. Of course this was the term she picked up on and now she uses it whenever she’s upset with something someone does.

I am annoyed beyond belief by this, especially as she gets back to school because I don’t want her shaming anyone.

What was even more annoying is that the MIL didn’t even admit it was her to start with! Eventually she did cop to it and so I have her lying to me.

Fortunately this fall is kindergarten and goodbye to her being our nanny."
lmaru0330,2021-04-17 18:32:24+00:00,Fighting during nap time,"Just need some insight here from parents of older toddlers. My son is 2 next month. He has been on the same schedule for the last 12 months; 0830 wake up, 1230 nap time, 2030 bedtime. He sleeps in his own bed for both nap time and bedtime. This last week or so, maybe week and a half, he has been terrible to put down for a nap and bed. He fights, rolls, screams, etc. for 20 minutes- 1 hour before he finally settles down. Once he settles down, he is usually asleep within 15-20 minutes which is how long it usually takes without all the fighting. We read to him for 15-20 minutes before he lays down as well. Some nights it’s taken my wife nearly 2 1/2 hours to put him down for bedtime. While he seems tired around 1130-12, he’s up until 1300-1400 fighting us before laying down and napping for 2-3hrs. I’m wondering if you think it’s time to take away the nap and maybe opt for an earlier bedtime ex: 1930 instead of 2030? Or maybe an earlier nap? We are kind of stumped because while he seems like he needs the nap, we don’t really have time to sit with him for hours rocking, holding, bouncing, etc. waiting for him to fall asleep as we have a 3 week old as well that needs tending too. Any input is appreciated. Thanks."
WeirdMuffins,2021-04-17 18:13:09+00:00,Let Them Play,"I took my 3yr old son to target with me and agreed that if he was good and patient with me he could get two toys. I was finally done shopping so I took him around to the toy aisle. While there he was so excited and wanted a barbie toy, she's got long red hair and wearing yoga clothing but he wanted it so I put it in our basket. I've always let my kid choose what he wants to wear or wants to play with and he loves dolls so nothing new. We kept walking and for the first time he saw a batman toy that comes with Bane and he has the equal amount of love and obsession over it. Yeah that's technically 3 toys but 2 of them came in the same box and I have a massive soft spot for batman. So in the end he got his barbie, batman and bane. The three Bs. My mother was a little put off by his choices but I've made it clear that I don't care what he plays with as long as its age appropriate. 
If he likes having his nails painted as batman dances with yoga barbie then fine. No harm done at all and it's cute seeing him express himself. So even if you're not sure how this will turn out just let them play. They're kids and don't care about labels."
Mitskislut,2021-04-17 18:13:06+00:00,How do I guard internet access without making him sneakier?,"I feel I have to explain our relationship first, he's almost 10 and I have an 8 year age gap with him, i'm aware I've been parentified to an extent. I look after him daily, but with the passage of time I've also kinda become his guardian online as my parents are not the most tech savvy. I've been clumsy with my approach to internet safety before, mostly out of paranoia as I've come to realize how harmful the internet was to me as a child, as i was certainly exposed to things i shouldn't have and i was taken advantage of multiple times.

This morning he got logged out of his Roblox account, it was a messy recovery but I was able to successfully log him in, in a process that included me logging in on my laptop. When I gave him his tablet with his account on, literally a minute afterwards, i saw he DMd a person, when i went to look at his DMs i noticed he's been talking to people daily for months.

The person he was chatting to is clearly not his age and instructed him to change his password and activate 2 step verification due to a recent wave of hackings last night so i assume that's why he got logged out today, this person also advised him about downloading stuff prior (Google chrome, and in a legit way, no spooky trojan afaik), it's nothing specific or outwardly malicious, but this leads me to believe that if someone instructed him to change his login info or download something with bad intentions, he would easily listen to them. It's my mistake but i never thought about looking into his Roblox because I've had multiple sit downs with him about safety on the internet, and I thought Roblox was safe enough, without taking into account it's a system that can be easily obsolete if you know your way around him, which most users do.

As i kept going down his DMs, it reminded me of the naivety i once had online that made me so easily fooled before, he seriously acts like a child, and he is, and i was stupid to think that he would behave any other way. I've turned everything about chatting off on his account so he can purely play for now and i will be more strict on his screen time and internet access, but as someone that knows what it's like to be a child and be so invested on the internet as your form of escapism, i feel it's only a matter of time before he becomes sneakier, i know once you get a taste of that sweet sweet internet freedom at age 10, if you suddenly get restrictions you'll long for that power trip again and make regretful decisions, been there. So how do i go about this aside giving him a talk? Am I overreacting because of what happened to me? I'm honestly at a loss right now."

Just as an example today he was outside and screaming (happily) and beginning to play aggressively. The situation began bothering the neighbours, myself, and our other kids. I calmly asked him to come into the house and count his fingers to 10 or “blow out the candle” on his finger so he could calm down. He flat out would refuse and I did say well we can’t go outside until we can play nicely and calmly. I suggested it’s a good time to have a break or play some toys in the basement and once he was feeling better we could go back to playing outside again. He began to say he was going to break things in the house and continued to get more upset. He started following our 3 year old around and pushing him and wouldn’t leave him alone. I held his hand and walked to to his room with him and said he needed to have a break until he could treat everyone nicely and the way they deserved. He would not stay in his room or the play area and would continue to come out and started to walk up against me and began pushing me. I told him I was starting to get mad and I needed space at that point as well. This all went on for an hour and I just couldn’t handle it anymore and I began yelling and at that point he did listen. I just don’t want to yell, I know it isn’t good and not healthy. I just am at a loss. 

He is seeing a psychologist and we have tried the things she suggested, most of the time he refuses to do them. He is also seeing a psychiatrist as well.

I'm a first time mom. I have no family to rely on locally and neither does my husband. I work from home due to Covid and took care of my baby girl ever since she was born (she's now 9 months). My workplace is now asking us to return to work starting in August for only one a day. Now I've found myself needing child care and have no clue what to expect at all. My coworkers who had children never hired any (they have large families). My mother also worked from home and raised us. 

Now, I understand that a once a week childcare situation is not very appealing. Day cares probably want a full time enrollee and nannies are probably booked as a full-timer too... For one day a week,   
would you put your baby in daycare, in-home daycare or hire a nanny?

What should I expect from each situation? In light of Covid, would it be unreasonable if I ask my nanny to wear a mask when working?

I have 3 months to look for something... is this enough time? I hear about long wait lists for day cares which I never would have imagined it could take so long. I'm also afraid that my baby will end up with a cold hearted and neglectful provider... My company contracts care services for vulnerable individuals and the complaints I hear are terrible. 

Thanks in advance."

He, alongside my parents, has been at home for the last year. Prior to this, he would not use these words as he did not know them but he was still somewhat physical at times, which was not a big problem. Over the past year with my dad being home, my brother has picked up on his habits of swearing, being angry, and being aggressive in his play. My father has become better but he is still far from perfect. My mum and I try our best to model good behaviour for him but my father seems to just ruin our progress, which has been really frustrating. Right now he only uses bad words when he's angry and he understands that none of them are actual words/words others will understand. He still has not stopped and doesn't seem like he's going to forget them anytime soon so I would appreciate any advice. With the issue of being physical, my father will come to spend 5 min with my brother and get him very energized and aggressive and then leave, a thing that he continues to do. We've told him continuously to stop but my father does not listen. The problem is my father's influence and that will be fixed in the next year, but for now, are there any tips or tricks to help my brother?"

It sickens me that so many parents put themselves first and make the kids suffer to get back at an ex.

SwarlyNotBarney,2021-04-17 14:17:42+00:00,Who is wrong in this situation,"So I’m going to make this post trying to be completely unbiased although it may become apparent which parent I am. Who is in the wrong?

The mother in this equation has raised two children on her own for 8 years. Constantly asked the father for financial support to which he would seldom help out. She tried to put him on child support for years and we would always avoid it. The mother didn’t have much of a support system and was never able to finish college due to working full time jobs. Mom agreed to send the children to live with dad for a year and a half so she could get back on her feet. 

The father in this equation has had primary custody of the children for three years (not the mom’s choice. She agreed to a year and a half remember). He makes very good money and supports the children well. He asks the mother for nothing and says the children are well taken care of but still expects her to give him child support. The mother has refused because she says he should be paying her child support and if they children have everything they want and need, there’s nothing for her to do. 

Is Dad wrong for asking for child support after deliberately avoiding it for so long and flashing his great life in mom’s face? Or is mom wrong for not ever getting her shit straight so she could pay child support?

Also just for reference, there is a court order that says mom pays no child support and the children don’t bring clothes etc to visits with mom."
kratosbatman,2021-04-17 13:52:30+00:00,Toddler sleep advice,"Need help with getting my daughter 20 months to go back to bed. 

My daughter is usually a perfect sleeper so I’m very blessed and thankful for that. We have no problem at nap time and at initial bed time. Nap time there’s no routine we just put her down and she goes to sleep.
Bed time it’s bath 1 book round of kisses and hugs and we put her down and she’s good. 

Even if she doesn’t fall asleep right away she lays there quietly until she does. All great! That’s not my issue. 

Our issue comes is if something wakes her up in the middle of the night. Be it the dog deciding that she must catch the possum in the back yard and bark right outside her window, night mare, what ever. If she wakes up In the middle of the night she will not go back to bed in her crib. 

We tried cry it out but not a huge fan so that last like two rounds if at all and we end up bringing her to bed with us. And she falls right back to sleep in our bed, But if we try to move her then she wakes right back up and we start all over. We never co-slept with her before the 15 month mark. Before that giving her a bottle when we were having a particularly hard time going back to bed always did the trick. She’s not a particular big fan of milk any more these days so I can’t give her a cup of that but we’ve tried water and it’s not the same. 

Her sleeping in our bed isn’t ideal she’s a squirmy little bugger and rolls around and effects our quality of sleep also we’ve haves some close calls where she’s almost rolled over one of us and off the bed before. 

Everything online is about toddler transitioning into big kid beds and 95%of the time I have no issues with her in her crib. And I have no issues with her going back to sleep in my bed, Literally we put her down and shes out as long we don’t pick her up again to move. 

The only thing that makes her upset after waking up is the crib and that’s the only time the crib is an issue."

He was on a balance bike from the age of 20 months and learnt to use a pedal bike within 20 minutes of first trying. I was so smug about it and have always believed his brilliant bicycling is down to my amazing parenting and use of balance bikes.
Along comes child number two. Terrified of the bicycle. I have tried countless times to get him on the balance bike to no avail. He is 5 and a half and cannot/will not ride a bike. My husband gently suggested stabilisers which I promptly poo pooed, because I have been so convinced of my methods with my eldest. However, we bit the bullet and finally put stabilisers on his bike. He is now happily cycling round the park and is very proud of himself.
The lesson my youngest child repeatedly shows me, is that whatever worked, or didn't work for my eldest, may not necessarily be the case for him . Parenting is a never ending journey of finding out how different they can be. I do my best parenting when I put my preconceived notions about what does and doesn't work to one side, and focus instead on the child in front of me."

I have a student in my year 7 class who, through no fault of his own, is in the care system. I won’t go into detail but quite recently, his foster placement broke down and he’s now in a children’s residential home.

He’s a wonderful boy. He struggles, emotionally; there are a lot of triggers for him which mean he needs to remove himself from lessons to cool down, etc, he can be be calm one moment and flipping tables upside down the next, his anger can escalate extremely quickly, even from something like another student talking about their parents, which is a completely normal conversation but, for the student in care, it upsets him; I do understand why - he’s had an unsettled life, and we are continuously working on ways to manage his feelings, but of course, we can’t erase memories of trauma he’s been through. 

What I’m really asking is: what is life in a children’s home like? I don’t want to ask him about the details because I don’t want this to be a trigger and bring on negative feelings for him, but for example, my own children get a story at bedtime, unlimited cuddles, 1:1 time with me, and so on. Does this happen in a children’s residential care home too? I feel that emotionally, children really need this, and I worry all the time that my student doesn’t have these sort of things available. 

Can anyone enlighten me?"

I’ve just been feeling very lost and lonely lately. I do absolutely nothing but take care of my child. I love being a mom more then anything, but I just wish I had someone to talk to and that this stupid pandemic would end so that I could get back to some normalcy.
I haven’t seen my friends or family in about 7 months.
Before I got pregnant I had a lot of friends and a very social life. I honestly spent almost every single day of my life with my 3 best friends. They basically lived with me. If I wasn’t with them I was with my sister and nieces, my mom or my boyfriend.. So I’ve always been very busy and out living my best life. Well when I found out I was pregnant I started planning my life for me and my child so I started distancing from my friends and social life a bit. My boyfriend moved into my apartment with me so of course I wasn’t having my friends over as much. I wanted to start getting use to not spending every second with my friends and doing what I want because I didn’t want to be a mom who was always out and about and not with her kid. I found out I was pregnant in May of last year so with the pandemic I also wanted to distance myself because I didn’t want to risk getting sick while pregnant. I was very forward about all of this with all of my friends and family and they understood that I was starting a family of my own and wouldn’t be the same wild and free friend I was before. I should also mention I’ve always had pretty bad anxiety so the whole pandemic actually scared the hell out of me. I was and still am terrified of getting sick. So during my second and third trimester I started seriously staying away from people but still keeping in touch. Well now my daughter is 4 months old and I have absolutely nobody besides her and my boyfriend because of COVID. None of my friends or family have met my daughter besides my mom. She has met her once after being quarantined for 14 days because that was the only way I allowed it.. My friends are in and out of bars and parties every weekend so I have not felt comfortable letting them see my daughter because I don’t want her to get sick. It’s my choice to be “lonely” and stay away from everyone, but it hurts my feelings because my friends have asked when they could meet her and I told them if they didn’t go to bars, parties and around a bunch of people for at least a week I would let them if they wore masks. I understand having to work or go to the grocery store but I didn’t feel like asking them to not go to unnecessary social settings before meeting my infant daughter was a unreasonable request. Well that was about 2 months ago and none of them have asked to meet her since.. I was actually told that they were saying to other people they want to meet my baby and see me but they can’t just “not live their life”... I don’t see how not going out for a week to safely meet your “best friends” child is stopping you from living your life? They were also telling people they miss the old me, which seriously hurt my feelings. I’m struggling enough with feeling like I’m nothing but a mom now considering I do nothing but be a mom so it hurts to hear people basically say they miss when I wasn’t one. Now they hardly even return my calls or text me back. Yeah I choose not to hang out  for the safety of my child’s health but I’d still love to have someone to text or FaceTime when I’m home alone with my baby or late at night when she won’t sleep.. they don’t even check up on me or my daughter to see how we’re doing. They did for about a month after I had her but now it’s rare when I hear from them at all and if I do I have to contact them first. I’ve been friends with them for years and we were extremely close. I have really always loved and cared for them so it just sucks to lose them. Maybe I am being to dramatic and scared about COVID and me or my daughter getting sick.. but it’s just not something I’m not willing to risk. My daughters health means more to me then hanging out with people.. I guess it is true that you see who your true friends are once you have a child :/
Sorry this has been a long post. I don’t even really know what I’m looking for out of posting this, just wanted to vent and see if any other parents are feeling lonely right now with the pandemic."
madnick1991,2021-04-17 08:04:49+00:00,Trouble Maintaining Feeding Times and Sleep,"Had our first child six days ago, a healthy baby boy. His only problem is losing weight. Our lactitionist wants us to increase our feeding periods to every two hours. She tells us to start feeding him every even numbered hour of the day. When I told her that he generally takes up to an hour before finishing, she reiterrated that he is to be fed again, one hour later. 

Our baby now eats not just twelve times a day, but for twelve full hours a day. It feels like I'm drowning my baby.

On top of that, during a two hour window, after feeding him for one hour, changing him twice, etc, my wife and I might have a 30 minute window for literally anything else in our life. We knew that caring for a newborn was going to be hard, and were/are prepared to give up most things in our life for the forseeable future. And since literally everyone LOVES to tell us that we wont get much sleep anymore, we already knew we were going to lose hours of sleep, but even we werent prepared to get cut down to 20 minutes of sleep every four hours. My wife has had a total of three hours over the last two days. Ive had two. All of it in ten to twenty minute blocks. And we feel like we are dying. 

What can we do? How can we possibly maintain this pace for the next three months?"
Hashimotosannn,2021-04-17 07:48:29+00:00,First time away from my baby is so hard,"So my MIL is taking care of my baby overnight for the first time and instead of being overjoyed I actually feel kind of sad.
The first time I was away from him, I had to leave him in hospital after he was born and coming home by ourselves was horrible but is the first time I’ve ever been away from him overnight since then. 
I completely trust my MIL but I can’t help but worry he’s going to give her a hard time. 
Is this normal? Does this get easier? How the hell do I enjoy my time?"
magnoli-a,2021-04-17 07:32:59+00:00,"Poop advice - Toddler doing one colossal, blow-out, bed-destroying poop every morning.","I have a 20-month-old who suddenly, every morning for the past month or two, I will go to get him out of bed for the day only to be faced with an insane amount of poop. I’m talking entire nappy loaded and also exploded out and leaking all through his pjs/bed. 

He seems to just save up 24 hours worth of poop for his bed and I am going insane having to wash his bedding and basically hose him down every morning. I have an 8 week old and this added mission every morning is really wearing me down.

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I have been to the dr and he has been cleared of any infection/bugs etc and appears normal and healthy. I suspected a possible sudden intolerance or something but the dr said it’s unlikely? I am going to get a second opinion but until then any thoughts/advice?"
mountainflutterby,2021-04-17 07:31:37+00:00,My ex has built my 5 year old a gaming pc and is teaching him how to play fortnight.,"I'm obviously horrified that he thinks this is a good thing to introduce to a small child who wouldn't even know what gaming is or violence otherwise. Having live chat with older kids and adults is also very scary with the language and potential vulnerability to abuse. I try to keeps things simple my end and I've been dreading him wanting a tablet to play games and zone out on all the time. I'm aware the world is different for this generation. But to actively build a gaming pc, when he's reading books about dinosaurs and watching Shaun the sheep.

I don't communicate with my ex, he was/is abusive towards me and I had to take him to court becuase was an alcoholic. We share our son every other week now. 

He's always bought him things inappropriate to his age, he's gone full out training him in several sports, buys him.very expensive equipment and essentially is creating a mini me..my son is exhausted when he comes home to me. He also tells me frequently that our son loves him more and will chose to live with him when he's 12 and has a right to decide. 

It's very complicated.
But now I'm just sat scared that my son is going to have nightmares or get addicted to gaming. His brain is still growing. His father is really really arrogant and I'm also worried my son will begin to feel superior to others in the same way.

I have lots of fears, he's only 5 and as you can tell. I've been through a lot as a mother already. 

 Any advice. Maybe I should contact my lawyer, we're back in court next month to discuss progress and the future for our son."
HoshikoNature,2021-04-17 06:39:34+00:00,Toddler has no sense of danger,"I have a 2.5 year old who has gotten into the habit of running for the road as soon as we leave the house. We also have a hedge row separating our driveway from the street, and she'll run around that instead of coming to the car to climb in. She also has no sense of stranger danger, she sees a person (like when we go hiking), no matter how far they are, she goes running up to them. No matter how much we call her back, or yell, or explain why she shouldn't be doing this, she just doesn't seem to understand nor want to listen and it's starting to stress me out because I also have a 3 month old to deal with at the same time.

So how can I get her to understand that it's dangerous to run onto the road, and that it's dangerous to run up to everyone? I'm worried she's going to get hit by a car or kidnapped one of these days, but she just doesn't seem to learn."
rocknroll888,2021-04-17 06:31:19+00:00,"Im planning on proposing, what would be the best way to talk to my son about this?","I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about three years now and overall, her and my son get along well. At first, he had some pretty big feelings about all this. His mom passed away when he was about 7 or 8 and me dating again had reopened some old wounds. He had felt as if I was trying to replace his mom. It took a while for him to accept and warm up to the idea. And to be fair, we did not get along a whole lot when he was a teenager, so I don’t think I handled that the best. 

      I’m looking for some advice on how to start this conversation and prepare for the possibility of these feelings coming up again. I don’t want to spring it on him that I’m getting remarried, so I want to make sure he’s involved in this."

autistic-screams,2021-04-17 06:06:02+00:00,I don't want to stop being a mom,"I'm 33 my daughter is 10 years old. I hate that the caring part is going to be over soon. She will go to school by herself, be a teenager and she will need me less every day. I'm looking forward to it at the same time. I can't wait to see what she will become but it hurts me at the same time. 

My husband never wanted kids but finally said fine we'll have 1. He loves our daughter so much, they are so close, but he still didn't want any more kids. 

I know I should be grateful for having one beatiful daughter, and I really am but I love being a mom so much. It just makes me sad that this was it. No more babies, no more running around after little ones no more chubby arms around my neck. 

Just needed to get it off my chest.
Thanks to anyone who might have read it. 
Have a lovely day

My partner wanted to chime in, so he whispered in my ears which made me laugh out loud. My 3.5 yo son looked at us and gave us a thumbs up, his seal of approval. 

It was so cute!!! 

Usually he'll be in the middle of us, always wanting attention. Always stopping us talking to each other, and had to talk looking at him. The thumbs up was unexpected and made us even more happy."

Throwawayy000000001,2021-04-17 04:06:27+00:00,"gray poop- posted in other subreddits as well, a bit concerned"," 

hey everyone, my newborn is 2 weeks old exactly, hes been extremely colicky from the start, he is exclusively formula fed, and we had him on enfamil in the beginning. regular enfamil. he would be up all night crying. pediatrician suggested to switch him to enfamil gentlease. the crying has improved DRASTICALLY. We have been giving him this formula for 24 hours at this point and he just pooped it was a grayish color with a little bit of yellow in it. it was definetly a smaller amount of poop than normal. before this all of his poops were yellow, i noticed the poop earlier today was more green and now its a gray.

I wont be able to contact pediatrician until tomorrow morning and most likely theyll return my call by the afternoon. I have two questions. 1., has anyone else had this experience before when switching from enfamil to enfamil gentlease? and 2., which formula should i use until i hear back from pediatrician? thank you if anyone can help"
woohaa09,2021-04-17 02:54:08+00:00,I really need some advice for school lockers.,"My son's school issued a No bag rule, they have to put their bags in the lockers unless it's medical. The problem is, only the rebuilt half of the school has long lockers, his is small like on TV. His bag fits tight in his locker without anything in it, the bottom shelf is too small. What can he do? 

This has been going on for a while, my son just went back to school and that's how we found out, I have mom friends who aren't really complaining about it so I'm not sure if it's just our problem or not and I don't want to take it to extreme if somebody here has experience and can help. He doesn't use a tablet or phone for school unless It's the specific teacher who allows it, so right now he has three textbooks and five notebooks and two library books and sometimes brings a lot, which cannot be kept in the nurse's office because it's reserved for people with dietary needs. We also don't know what to do with his utility box and IEP book, which he takes tl to classes with him but they usually don't let them have boxes that can spill or have weapons in them at lunch or assemblies. I'm considering trying to get them to switch them out lockers but I don't want to screw someone else over if we're overlooking something and there's a chance he would have a locker partner if he got a bigger lock er and that's an automatic no with his special needs."

rowdyate9,2021-04-17 02:37:27+00:00,I am not a smart woman,"Last summer we bought a used Subaru. I thought I tried everything, but I could never figure out how to activate the windshield wiper fluid. I figured it was just broken and have been going to the gas station to squeegee down my windshield when it gets dirty. 

The other day, I was letting my two year old boy play in the front seat of the car (obviously the key wasn’t in the ignition) because he likes to honk the horn and press all the buttons, and I took the chance to sit in the passenger seat and look at my phone.  All of a sudden, I see wiper fluid spraying across the windshield and I turn to my toddler and say “How did you do that?!” and he points to a button at the end of the wipers control stick that I never noticed. 

A 2yo taught me how to use a function on my car. I’m a fucking moron"
rockarma13,2021-04-17 02:32:56+00:00,2 year molar question,"My son is getting his 2 year molars. All his symptoms are by the book. My concern is that A) it looks extremely inflamed on the site of it, as just a tiny part of his tooth is out. B) he has been biting his cheek today and it’s caused a horrible looking canker sore. Basically when I look at that area as a whole it’s looks pretty bad. I do plan on calling his dentist but they are closed over the weekend. Can anyone give me a piece of mind or possible relate until I speak to his doc. 

Side note, his behavior has been perfectly fine and playful."
Much-Cartographer264,2021-04-17 01:50:45+00:00,Back to work but my son is giving me a hard time,"like the title says I went back to work this week. I started doing administrative work for my dad's company. it's been good, working decent hours, 7am to about 4, 2 days a week to start which eventually will become full time once we all start adjusting. I have been home with my June 2019 baby since he was born. 
while I'm working he stays with my mom. these 2 days with my mom he's apparently been an angel. listens when she says no, holds her hands on walks, is calm, sits and reads with her, no tantrums and most importantly he has laid down and taken his naps there. since birth I've rocked him to sleep for naps and bedtime so I knew this was going to be the biggest hurdle. but according to her he's been wonderful. 

so when I'm done work I go back home with my dad to their house because my mom also prepares us all dinner. as soon as I get home to him he's scratching, pulling my hair, climbing like a maniac and basically being a menace. my mom says he's not like this at all with her. today after a long day of work I go to him and deal with the most temperamental my son has ever been. it was horrendous. 
hes also just been really aggressively affectionate to me. he pulls my ears so hard they're starting to bleed a bit because he scratches them, but he does this so he can give me a super hard kiss. he is slamming his head on me constantly. I've gotten a few bloody lips. I know he does this out of affection and wants to be close and cuddly. I do love it, but I'm getting beat up all the time.
and truthfully, my son is great. he's not a horrible kid, he's just super aggressive because he gets so excited. he was doing great with learning to be gentle but its gone out the window. 

I know my faults as a parent and as he gets older I'm having a much harder time disciplining him and getting him to listen. I'm inconsistent which again, I know isn't good. I give him his freedom a lot but when it's time to listen and follow the rules I'd love for him to obey. I was so embarrassed my mom could see me getting flustered. nothing I did worked. every time I tried to get him to calm down and listen he laughed like I was being funny. I've tried so many things ( albeit inconsistently) but nothing seems to reign this kid in. he's headstrong, stubborn and charming as all heck. he knows his way around us. 
while I am proud of him that he behaves when I'm not around, I also don't think I want to deal with work and then come home and deal with a devil child (no offense to my child, I adore him). I do feel like he's punishing me for leaving him. maybe this is just how he's adjusting to this big change. we are also moving in the next few weeks so I feel horrible he's going through many big changes so quickly but I also want to give him all the right tools to help him adjust positively. 

are there any things I could do? maybe books to read for discipline? I feel so in over my head lately. is this just his coping mechanism?"

We wash her hair once a week because she hates it so much. She has such long hair. She turns 2 this year and I hate washing her hair. It makes me feel so bad for her. Has anyone else experienced this? She doesn't like her head tilted back and hates water in her eyes, understandably."

I would give him a bottle in the morning. For lunch, he would have some purée carrots and some rice porridge. Then another bottle around 4. For dinner, he would have purée carrots and rice porridge. Then another bottle before bed. 

I cook the rice porridge with water. I read that 6m baby’s main source of nutrition is breast milk. Is the baby getting enough milk in his diet?"

Send help please.,"Our 10 month old has never been the best at sleeping or taking naps but this past week has been a new low.  He’s a very, very energetic guy.  Doesn’t enjoy cuddling or holding still.  Likes to always be on the move.  I would think that would wear him out but no such luck.  We’ve been lucky to even get one 30 minute nap a day and it’s really rare to have two naps.  He’s gotten worse at falling asleep at night and sleeping any length of time throughout the night.  Somehow he still manages to have a ton of energy during the day and is usually in great mood when he’s up.  I’m worried this lack of sleep and quality nap time is going to have a negative impact but have no clue how to help him anymore.  It feels like everything we try doesn’t work."
maggiedubyah,2021-04-17 01:21:43+00:00,3 Year Old's Aggression,"Recently, (6 weeks ago) my DH and I welcomed our second baby, a boy. We also have a 3.5 year old daughter. 

I knew the transition for her would be difficult and prepared (read about it, asked advice etc.). She has calmed down emotionally and we are back in a routine now that the baby is a bit older so overall, she seems to be adjusting. 

However, she is REALLY aggressive with the baby. Hitting, throwing objects at him, scratching his face etc. Obviously, we are really vigilant and not allowing her to be alone with him as well as attempting to provide lots of consistency and positive attention but it is still occurring daily that she is hurting him and making him cry. This is really wearing on myself and my husband especially. 

Is this normal? Any advice or perspective is welcome."
csheabob,2021-04-17 01:18:38+00:00,My sister is failing high school,"Hello all. I (21F) am my sister's (17F) legal guardian as of June of 2020. I have an older post from a while back that goes into more detail about how and why this came to be, but basically she was doing a whole bunch of shit that she wasn't supposed to and my aunt and uncle wanted to get rid of her. She was going to be put in foster care but I stepped in and here we are.

So, she doesn't do lots of drugs or sneak out to be with bad boys like she used to. She isn't suicidal anymore (there were two attempts while she was living with aunt and uncle) and she has had a job that she likes since August 2020. The problem is she simply hates school. She was going in-person at first, and tolerated it but didn't really like it. I checked her grades often and they were good. Her teachers were chill and I never received any bad phone calls from them so I felt like she was genuinely doing good.

Well, I myself dropped out of college because it simply wasn't attainable or logical at this point in my life. I got a job with the USPS and the training is two weeks long.  I had to be at this training at 7:30 A.M. everyday, and this was right before Christmas break for my sister. I didn't find out until much later, but she skipped school every single day for those two weeks that I was at training. Not to go out and do crazy teen stuff, but just sleeping in bed. I only found out about this in February when the state law enforcement agency sent a letter saying that her license was suspended due to excessive absences. 

After the Christmas break, she wanted to switch to online and I was fine with that. But it has been a constant battle to get her to even get up 5 minutes before her first period zoom starts. She will hear me out and agree and we will write out a schedule and routine for her days, but it always reverts to doing the least amount of school work possible (if any) and taking naps between every zoom class. I have to work and I have no family to watch her or anything while I'm gone, so it is useless to try and monitor her 24/7. Besides, that isn't doing any good for her...she has to make the decision to try on her own.

I'm not even asking for good grades, I just want her to pass her classes. I even told her I will help on any assignments and as many as she needs in what free time I have, but anytime I ask about school she reverts to lying. I get calls from teachers asking me to tell her to submit her 2-weeks-overdue tests and quizzes. And she knows that if her attendance isn't up at the end of the semester that they will not reinstate her driver's license, but it does not seem to be a good motivator.

Her only two friends are two years older than her and they go to our local university. I knew them before she did because we went to the same high school, and I know they're good kids. I only let her hang out with them on weekends or after she's ""done"" with school, but I know she always lies about being ""done"". 

I just checked her grades for the first time since our last heart-to-heart about finishing high school and not lying to me. She isn't a bad person and she was hurt that she hurt me by lying all the time, yet she continues to do it. She has a 100 in P.E. and her three core classes are all below 50. She wants to go to cosmetology school and I know her so I know that would be a better option than college, but I don't even know if she will graduate HS at this point.

In less than a month, we have a court date with the judge who granted custody to me. I have full custody, it is not a temporary order, he just wanted to do ""check-ins"" since this is a rare situation, and this is supposed to be our last one. She had good grades at the last one and everything went fine. I'm worried now that my custody of her is at risk due to her attendance and failing grades. I'm so constantly stressed and worried but I literally cannot force her to do her work no matter what punishments I give or wisdoms I try to impart. I know I definitely cannot go on with this for another year (or more since she's likely to fail this quarter). We have no other family, though, and I would never abandon her. I just have no idea what to do."
ironic-hat,2021-04-17 01:11:45+00:00,Benadryl for children under the age of 4,"So here is something that threw me for a loop.  My two year old has a mild cold.  The pediatrician mentioned in the past to not give cold medicine to children under age two.  Since he is over age two, and meets the weight requirements, I offered him 5ml of Children’s Benadryl at bedtime to aid his sinus congestion.  Dosage was from a pediatric medical group that listed the amount per age and weight.  

Nearly immediately after I gave him the medicine I start seeing a million articles saying you shouldn’t give children under 4! cold medicine.  Great....

So I am confused about the effectiveness and safety of this product.  Does it actually work and this is just a warning to prevent parents who may use it as a sleep aid vs it’s true purpose.  It seemed to reduce his runny nose, so I can’t imagine it not working as some articles are claiming."
Mommabear2311,2021-04-17 01:10:14+00:00,Am I wrong? My husband always makes feel like I am in the wrong.,"You are going to need some backstory so please bare with me because I really need advice. I'm really not in a good mental state.

My husband and I lived apart for quite sometime(years) because of custody issues with my son. I am finally moving to the state he is in.  We have 2 children together.  My oldest is not his. We have one chance for him to get our household belongings.  I have givien up primary custody of my son which was a really hard decision for me so we could be a family. (I will get summers, the GAL said it's best if my son stays) Our youngest has a l severe mental disability so I cannot raise him alone.  I feel like I am choosing one child over another.  I feel like no choice I could have made was a right choice.

Well to get to the point.  My oldest son's father did not even look at the papers we sent over when we told them that this would have to be done by x date.  Well my husband is telling me he is now not coming to get our stuff or visiting us for the week he took off of I do not leave.  I feel like if I leave without papers I will get screwed, like I don't care.  Things in court never gone my way and I feel like just up and leaving will hurt me on the long run.  He is manipulative and putting a lot of added mental strain on me.

What am I supposed to do?  Am I wrong for wanting to stay until papers are signed?  What is the big deal with him getting out stuff and setting up the house without me especially when he blames me for him not having a relationship with our youngest two. Papers still are a issue because my son's father is saying if I see my son once a month I cannot visit him a second time in the month.  I'm a emotional wreck."
xxeminex,2021-04-17 01:05:52+00:00,What makes it worth it?,"I (24F) wanted to come here and ask, what made you want kids? What are the pros of having kids? What advice would you give someone on the fence about having kids? Is it really worth it? 

My fiance (25M) loves kids and wants our own (someday--years from now). I also love kids, but I'm scared to ever have them, both physically and emotionally it seems so taxing. I'm afraid of falling into depression due to the energy it takes to care for a baby. I also can't picture myself giving birth or nursing my child. I think I'd want to bottle feed, but I'm scared of the judgement I'd get. 

I'm also afraid of how it can change a marriage. My fiance and I have an incredible, loving relationship and I've seen how couples change with the stress of kids. I never want to lose the relationship I have with my fiance. 

I've always had a caregiver personality, though, and I love my nephew and spending time with him (he's 7 months old)

 and  a childfree life also seems really permanent and possibly depressing to me. I feel like kids bring purpose and life into a family, but does that outweigh all the exhaustion and frustration?

How do you know the right decision for you? What if you regret your decision? 

(also, just wanted to point out my fiance is very supportive that I'm on the fence about kids. he's also wants to do a lot of discussing and researching before we make that decision someday)"

This is the thing I have learned from 28 years of parenting six children:  children are peers to their parents.   We happen to be in charge for a while because we were born first, but our job is basically to show the new people the ropes, not to tell them what's what.   Our kids will eventually wander bravely into places we couldn't dream of."

I also had an ultrasound in January to rule out ovarian cysts. I of course, riddled with anxiety since having my baby, think everything is cancer. 🙄

RunRevolutionary9019,2021-04-16 22:24:28+00:00,I’m really struggling with how to proceed with my mentally ill child.,"My kid was perfect until about eleven. The easiest kid on the planet. Did well in school. Was reasonable as a two year old even. Super chill and still is actually. 
Then they started doing worse and worse in school and said they were hearing voices. And I could feel it. I was terrified. 
I had nights I was worried I’d wake up to a dead kid. There’s not objective reason why but that was how I felt. 
Finally last year he said he thought he needed medication for psychosis so we went that route and it is been night and day helpful. 
I no longer worry about my kids happiness. 
Now it’s just school that’s the issue. 
He also has ADHD. He’s a genius. He’s an amazing amazing artist. And he’s transgender if that matters at all. 
He really struggles with school. It’s not just that he has a hard time he just doesn’t want to deal. 
We’ve tried a few ADHD medications with varying success. 
He has two tutors but blew both of them off this week. I’m happy to say he is excited about his drum lessons and does lots of art so at least he’s not sitting around doing nothing. 
We are pushing him into art like my moms parents did for her but even that isn’t always easy. 
He’s unmotivated. 
A part of the problem is I have chronic health issues so my energy is limited. I also have ADHD so I feel like a kitten trying to herd kittens. 
More and more I’m feeling like I’m failing my kid and I don’t know how to proceed. 
I’ve said he can’t see friends if he doesn’t do his work and I’m so torn on that path. I’m not sure isolating him is the way. 
If anyone has gone through this and and can share their experience I would so appreciate it. One of my half sisters also has psychosis but it is untreated. She lives with her mom and doesn’t work. 

My concern is I’m sick and not sure that will be an option. What if I’m gone? What if I can barely support myself? 
I’m doing everything I can to get my home paid off so we have a place to live if things get really real. 

He thankfully has a lot of friends. He does want to move to the city. I’m just not sure how he’s going to support himself. 

Praying he gets a clue like I did and gets it together. I dropped out of high school. Which again makes me a horrible example and pretty incapable of helping him with school myself. 

I now make good money and have a masters degree. It was and is just really hard given my imperfect brain.  

I gave up on work today. I just couldn’t. My body and brain were not having it. So I completely relate with my kid. We have major sleep issues. 

When I had him I was very healthy and had mostly nipped my ADHD in the bud but for whatever reason getting sick kicked it into high gear. 

But I don’t want him following my path but I’m also not sure there’s a thing I can do about it. 

We both have great therapists and lots of support to be clear."
tealambert,2021-04-16 22:23:29+00:00,How to get through to teenage daughter?,"My husband and I are at out wits end trying to get through to our 13 year old daughter. The last few months she’s been pushing the boundaries and breaking rules and our punishments don’t seem to be getting through. 

Her first, and biggest offense, was using her iPod to message strangers on the internet when she knew the rule was family and friends only. We took her ipod for 2 weeks. We gave her the benefit of the doubt that she misunderstood the rules when we said friends because she said the person she messaged was her “friend”. We clarified it was friends we knew in person and gave it back after the 2 weeks. 

Had to take the iPod back a few days later for the same reason. This time we grounded her for a month; took all electronics, no outside for a week, and made her write a two page apology explaining why what she did was wrong. We also explained she would have to complete 200 chores to pay us back for iPod. 

About 2 weeks into punishment I caught her trying to turn her tv one night. I told her that her month long punishment would restart and she now had to keep her door open unless changing. 

Tonight she was outside playing and I called her and her sister in for dinner except she was nowhere to be found. We called several time and eventually found her a few houses down from the boundary house she’s not supposed to pass. 

She is a very thoughtful and kind young lady. Each time she breaks the rules she express she understands the rules and why they’re important. We’ve never had problems with her before. Everyone usually comments on her great manners and sweet disposition. She never complains, never talks back, she’s the easiest kid a parent could ask for. 

No matter the punishment she just doesn’t seem to care, she just rolls with it. She literally couldn’t care any less. This time we took all toys, her bed, her clothes, snacks. She has a sleeping bag, a few books, and a military green shirt/shorts from my husband. We told her the law says she needs food, a roof, and clothes. The food doesn’t have to taste good and the clothes don’t have to look good. 

Does anyone have any advice because I’ve run out of things to try. She’s a good kid and I want to keep it that way but she needs to listen to the rules, not break them. Any ideas?"
FranniPants,2021-04-16 22:02:31+00:00,(Almost) 2 yo: Is this a coincidence or by design?,"I have an almost two year old son. Wednesday night he was playing with his six pack of crayons while my sister/her S.O. were over and he handed us each a crayon: black to me, yellow to husband, red to older son, green to sister's S.O., blue to sister, and kept orange to himself. Cute, he's sharing!

As the night went on, several times he handed the crayons back out to us. Each of us were given the same colors each time and he got very upset if we tried switching with one another. 

Yesterday - he handed out the crayons again. Once again: yellow to husband, black to me, red to older son, and kept orange to himself. (Blue and green remained unused) I thought it was weird but okay?

Tonight, same thing. Same colors. He gets upset when we try switching. 

Is this coincidence? Is he associating certain colors with each of us, and that's why he wants us to keep what he's giving us? Or... is this a sign of autism or something similar?"

Seriously? “Yes! You live here and have to do stuff. If you don’t like it, please consider living with dad!” Then she accuses me of pushing her out and going to live with dad is a threat. But it’s totally not! I think it’s a good option and he would love that.

Well today! We bit the bullet, she has been asking for a specific barbie doll for a while and we made a deal to throw her last dummy into the bin outside the toy shop and that she could get the doll. 

She was very excited at the time but reality has set in and since we got home and she got more tired, she has become more and more unsettled and crying for the dummy.

For the moment she is settled but I wondered if anyone had any words of encouragement I could say to her to try and help her through this transition period.

DancingPopcorn237,2021-04-16 18:06:00+00:00,How to approach discussing baby with infertile family members?,"
I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but here goes. 

I (30f) and my husband (27m) have a 2 month old baby boy. I have two sisters in law. One is a few years older than me and the other a few years younger. Younger SIL and her husband have two young children (4m and 2m). Older SIL and her husband are infertile.

When we first found out I was pregnant, older SIL and BIL were the first ones we told. We met with them privately to tell them before telling anyone else so we could be certain they would not hear the news second hand. They seemed genuinely happy for us. I was relieved by this reaction as SIL had seemed upset by other pregnancy announcements/ baby-related news within the family. I discussed my pregnancy with my older SIL if she asked me things, but tried not to talk about it overly much otherwise as I knew babies/children were a sensitive topic. (For example, SIL attended my baby shower but was quiet and seemed on the verge of tears for a lot of the afternoon. It was the same at my younger nephews last birthday party. I tried to talk with her privately after the fact to make sure she was alright and she insisted she was fine and didn't want to talk about it.)

I am in an ongoing group chat with my MIL and two SILs. We just chat about what we have going on in our lives mostly. I currently stay at home with the baby, so the bulk of what is going on with me on a daily basis is baby-related. Would it be insensitive to include these things in the group chat (baby rolled over for the first time, etc)? I know my MIL and younger SIL love hearing about the baby, but it seems hit and miss with older SIL as to whether or not these things are upsetting. I don't know of I should have a separate group chat to discuss baby milestones and such or if that would be inappropriate as it would exclude older SIL from baby related conversation. Does anyone have any experience with something similar?"
kristigem,2021-04-16 17:53:35+00:00,I’m taking my son to buy a dress.,"I have two sons. A six year old and a four and a half year old. My older boy is into Minecraft, Mario and sonic the hedgehog, play fighting, and playing in the mud. My younger enjoys princesses, baby dolls, and stuffed animals. His favorite colors are pink and purple. He has also been growing his hair out for the last two years. He likes having hair styles like mommy. 

Both of my boys have gotten a mixture of stereotypical “boys” and “girls” toys as they’ve grown up. Dinosaurs and dolls, horses and action figures, a play kitchen and hockey net and sticks. 

We’ve always let them lead in telling us what they want to play with. They get to choose the clothes they wear. If there are different colors of an object we’re buying for them they choose their colors. They decide how they want their hair to look like. We’ve always told them that it’s their body and they had a right to choose. 

When we moved to our new house two years ago we unpacked a small rainbow dress that I had crocheted when I discovered I was pregnant. He was two years old. It was a bit too small for him, but he loved his “princess dress”. Obviously after a year he could no longer wear it.

Two days ago, he asked me to get him a new dress since his rainbow dress is too small. I told him I would think about it. I talked to my husband to get a game plan about this. 

This morning, we asked him why he wanted a dress. He said because they're pretty colors and they have flowers or stripes on them. 

Then we told him he can wear whatever he feels comfortable in, but that dresses are usually worn by girls and he said ""just because dresses are for girls doesn't mean that I can't wear one"". 

We said that people might make fun of him if he wears a dress. We asked what he would say to someone who told him that dresses are for girls. He said, ""I'll say that this dress is for me!"" 

I’m taking him to the store today. This kids confidence is through the roof and I'm so happy he feels comfortable enough to be who he wants to be. Im a little worried of what others will say to him, but I want him to be happy and comfortable in what he looks like. This is definitely uncharted territory for me who grew up in a very conservative and restrictive household. If anyone has any kind tips or comments please feel free to share."
babygrlnad,2021-04-16 17:30:12+00:00,How to have conversations with my kids about diversity and injustice (now and ongoing),"Today my toddler and I were listening to a Tracy Chapman song and he commented that she's brown. I realized that due to quarantine his exposure to other people, especially people that look different than him, has been so limited. I did my best to explain that everyone comes in different colors and shapes and sizes. I explained that just like his cousin has red hair and mom has green eyes and grandpa has brown skin, other people have all different kinds of features. He seemed satisfied with that answer, but it got me thinking.... 

I am half white and half middle Eastern, but looking at me people assume I'm just white. My dad has dark skin, hair, and eyes, and an accent. My mom is blond with blue eyes and freckles. I grew up in a very diverse community that was predominantly Haitian, Dominican, and Jewish. Conversations that my parents had with me as a child were reiterated in meeting and knowing all kinds of people. We now live in the same state I grew up in, but in a much less diverse town, and I want to make sure we start having very open conversations very early. And I am not sure how to make sure those conversations click if most of the people around my boys have the same skin color and life experiences. 

And I know I am coming from a position of privilege- we are a white family in a middle class neighborhood, and both my husband and I have graduate degrees. But I am raising two white boys that I want to be empathetic and understanding and allies. I want them to see the injustices in the world and try to make it a better place. I want them to stand up for people who are being discriminated against. 

I know I just need to be open and honest, to talk about things we see in the news, and to have age appropriate conversations that hopefully come up organically. But any other advice?? Things to make sure I say, or make sure I don't say?? I don't want my ignorance to play a factor at all, and I'm sure there are things I'm not even aware that I am unaware of."
Complex_River,2021-04-16 17:29:14+00:00,whats the problem is with my kid painting her face? Can someone please explain this to me.,"My kid loves painting her face. Like she looks up pics of face paint and tries to recreate what she sees or gets super in to making her own designs. 

I think its neat to see her so interested in something creative. I let her wear it whenever she wants- which is almost always in old-school time and to school for special days (holidays/party days-its preschool). 

I legit do not see anything wrong with this. Yet, now that it's gone on a while, I've found that people make vague judgemental comments about it. Not to her, they're always super nice to her...but I hear stuff like:

""You let her go anywhere like that, dont you?""

""She doesnt care what she looks like, does she?""

""Oh, her face is painted...again""

But it's got like a certain judgy tone, if that makes sense. 

One of her friends moms always offers to wash her face so she will ""feel clean"" - she has soap and doesnt paint her mouth area for practical eating/napkin purposes, the same mom who asked if I thought it was age appropriate  (shes 5). 

Can someone please explain to me what's going on here? I'm concerned I'm missing something about why letting her do this all the time is a bad idea? What would be off putting about a kid with frequent face paint?"

Derangedbuffalo,2021-04-16 16:56:41+00:00,Does anyone else feel guilty for being unable to play when you’re ill or injured?,"I have been experiencing a lot of pain with sciatica this past week which has gotten so bad that I struggle to walk and can’t stand for long at all. Because of this I have admittedly spent a lot of time alternating between laying and sitting down. The exercises my doctor gave me have actually caused more pain, so I’ve been advised to just take it easy for a few days to reduce inflammation. I’m currently on a strong anti inflammatory but so far it hasn’t helped. 

Because of this I just can’t really play, I can’t sit on the floor, I can’t play football in the garden, I can’t even pick my son up and give him a cuddle. 

I just feel incredibly guilty and awful. The house is messy (I have slight ocd so this is also very stressful and shameful for me) and I just feel awful as it’s half term and my son must be so bored. 

I feel like this rant (kind of) is just getting it off my chest in the hopes that others have been in this situation and that I’m not an absolutely awful parent because of this"
Grimmshadow88,2021-04-16 16:47:26+00:00,How to get over or better handle the anxiety of new parenting?,"I’m speaking with a therapist for my PPD/PPA, but I would love to hear from real parents. 

How did you get over the anxiety of being a new parent? Things are constantly changing, sometimes for better sometimes for worse. I have such a hard time doing anything now. I’m terrified to leave the house because what if he doesn’t nap in the car? I’m afraid to take any trips because what will I do when he melts down and I can’t console him? Will he ever sleep anywhere besides his crib? The terror of changing anything that is working currently paralyzes me on a daily basis. I’m too afraid of the change to come to do anything. I feel trapped and I want to learn to let go and just go with the flow, but I just…cant for some reason. 

How did you let go and learn to be some level of zen with the ups and downs and change? I’ll listen to anything at this point because this much anxiety and fear is starting to make me feel like I’m not cut out for this even though deep down I know I am."
leakygatsby,2021-04-16 16:45:39+00:00,Diaper Rash Thread,"First time parent checking in here and looking for some advice...

My son is 11 weeks old and is overall a healthy and happy baby. On formula for the last 8 weeks (won’t say more other than breastfeeding vibes weren’t clicking). He had shown a tendency to spit up more than what we and our pediatrician were comfortable with on low-volume feeding sessions so we moved him from Enspire to Gentlease to AR (all Enfamil products).

There was a low level of blood in his poo when after being on AR for a week or so although the spit-up got to an acceptable point so our pediatrician recommended we try Nutramigen since it is Hypoallergenic. We switched to that last week. Spit ups continue on Nutramigen, but honestly he doesn’t make a big production out of the spit-ups and it doesn’t seem to cause him discomfort.

Anyways, how does this translate to poo... what comes in must come out, right? As parents who are also on this fun ride of trying new formulas likely understand, his poop consistency changes drastically amongst all the aforementioned products. When he hit AR, his poop was getting thicker and creating less frequent BMs. Again, this didn’t bother him and actually was nicer for us to clean since it lessened the chances of blow-ours. He was never getting diaper rashes up through AR, not even the slightest redness (FYI, we have always used Pampers Swaddles and Sensitive Wipes). 

Fast forward to jumping to Nutramigen... this is causing his BMs to be much more frequent (back up to 5 or 6 per day rather than the 2/3 on AR) and almost liquid consistency. The liquid consistency seems to also be causing a diaper rash causing the skin to be raw to the point of skin breaking and slight bleeding :( obviously this is causing discomfort with him. We started using Boudreaux’s Butt Paste with each changing but not having much success.

Anyone else have these types of problems/can make any recommendations? We have already contacted our pediatrician to try and get him moved back over to AR if she clears it but any advice from others would be super appreciated."
hrrrlscout,2021-04-16 16:23:38+00:00,Scared for my kid starting Kindergarten,I am absolutely terrified for my kid starting Kindergarten in September because he’s not very typically “boyish”.

steel867,2021-04-16 15:59:35+00:00,Any tips,Hey never posted in this reddit or on hardly any reddits tbh. Im 23 and got with a girl and she has a 1 and half year old we got a apartment together and everything has been going relatively smoothly. The only problem we are having with the baby is when one of us is alone with him. He is a very naturally chill baby. He will watch whatever is on tv. He will occupy himself with his own toys. I mean he's a golden child. The second we are both together with him though it's like a flip switches and he whines constantly. If she leaves the room he starts bawling non stop. He will literally hang on her leg and whine and won't let her take her attention away. And if she even lays her head on my lap while we are watching tv he will walk up and start hanging on her or grab things he's not supposed to and whine pretty much just to get her undivided attention which is stuff he never does when it's just one of us with him at once and just try to test us. I'm assuming just to get attention. The only thing I can figure out is it's a jealousy thing. But we've lived on our own for almost a month and a half now and it is not gotten any better at all and I'm just wondering if anybody has any tips out there on what to do. Because honestly I never thought I would have a child at my age but I was willing to take on the challenge because  his father is not in his life so I knew he wasn't going to grow up with anybody as a father figure. But this jealousy thing if that's what it is it's just the main barrier I'm trying to get over right now so any tips would be nice.
atsignmakayla,2021-04-16 15:58:26+00:00,My Sister tries to make me seem like a bad parent to her friends,"Important information: my sister is 19, she’s got issues caused by childhood trauma with our mom (although often times this is used as an excuse for her fairly shitty behavior), she lives with my grandma, I’ve got a 6 month old daughter, and a 2 year old son 

Backstory: my sister and I haven’t really ever been EXTREMELY close, but whenever I got pregnant she started begging me to move in with her and my grandma and the closer it got time to deliver my son, my husband and I decided that maybe it wasn’t such a bad idea so I’d have the extra help since he’d be working (we ended up moving into our own apt by the time my son was 6 months old), so prior to his birth i had specifically asked no one to post pictures of him until we were home, settled, and I had shared his picture because he was my first and so this time was very special for my husband and I. I didn’t want to be bombarded with comments just yet, i wanted to savor those moments. Well the day he was born i sent our immediate family a picture of him, well right after i had sent them my sister posted them on all her social media accounts (as minor as that is, it is only the tip of the iceberg). When we got to come home there’d be several instances that my son would wake up crying and she’d come across the hall into our room and tell me that she would get him and that i could go back to sleep (there was only a few times that I took her offer because newborns are exhausting; but most times i still got up because i enjoyed those times with him, I wanted that bonding time). She’d take hundreds of pictures of him, post him on her Snapchat story, take pictures of him and her but never of him and I (still a minor and petty complaint so i left it alone). Well when my son was about 6 months old we got our own apartment (less than 5 mins from my grandmas) my sister then had an emotional breakdown saying she felt like “her nephew was being taken away from her”, we literally were moving a few blocks away. She seriously tried asking me if she could keep him every weekend like we’re co-parents or something. I told her that no aunt i know keeps their nephew every weekend, and that i wasn’t going to have set dates to when she could keep him. I was very lenient with her at first, she’d pick him up with her friend who had a son his age and I’d let her take him with them to the park up the road from apt, he’d stay the night every now and then, ya know. Typical things. But then my cousin comes to me telling me she recorded a video of my apartment (while we were moving furniture) and sent it to him and my other sister saying my apartment was a mess, and that she acted like she always had my son. Shortly after this another one of friends also comes to me telling me she makes it seem like she always has my son and that my husband and I are bad parents, and then i also got screenshots of her telling people my son was hers. All within a very short period of time. 

Anyways fast forward to now and she’s not kept my son in MONTHS, she’d been asking lately, and acting more mature so i figured I’d let him go over for a couple hours (plus i hate that my grandma also has to be punished when it’s not her fault). So since COVID i told her i didn’t want him around anyone other than her and my grandma. Of course she didn’t listen, she had a friend who’s got a daughter younger than him come over to have a “play date”, later that night i get a call from my grandma saying my sister and her friend left the kids in her room by themselves and that my son bit the little girl on the foot causing her to fall off the bed (he sees me nibble/tickles his baby sisters feet so I’m almost 100% sure this is all he was trying to do, not bite her). We go get him and she starts telling me her friend with the son has been talking about me so i message her friend only to find out this (screenshots posted below). I really just need advice. I don’t know what to do at this point.. obviously my son won’t be going back there for a very long time, if ever."

Just to give you an idea of the type of child he is, he whines a lot, can't sit still, throw's lots of temper tantrums and this is usually on a daily basis. With that being said, he does a lot of this with his mother and not me but he does test me still quite a bit. My wife says it's like being in an abusive relationship, our son treats her very badly but obviously she loves and does anything for him. It's starting to break my heart, she is an awesome mother and person and I can tell she's becoming depressed about it. I can wake him up in the morning no problems (most of the time), if she wakes him up, he goes full mental and the same thing with bed. He prefers me over her every hour of the day and it's starting to become a struggle. We have told our pediatrician about it and she just shrugs it off as being a normal process but the thing is, this has been going on for 6+months and I'm not sure how much more she can take. Just looking for any type of guidance at this point."
shmaylabee,2021-04-16 15:31:14+00:00,Asking to go potty,"My SS (3M) graduated from pull-ups/diapers during the day and most recently at night. But the most frustrating thing is he asks EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. if he is allowed to go potty. He will wake us up in the middle of the night, ask during a movie, while he is eating ""I need to go poop"" ""can I go pee?"" and I have no idea where he learned it from. He will not go to the bathroom without asking first. He has not once walked into the bathroom when he feels the need to go, and just go. It drives me and my husband crazy!! I figured maybe he is learning that the bathroom is a safe place, could it be psychological? We have always encouraged going when he needs to and accidents have never been a ""bad"" thing. I have a niece who kept pooping her pants (despite being almost 5y.o) because she regressed from disciplinary action. Has anyone else dealt with this??"
bonniebindi,2021-04-16 15:20:44+00:00,The daily morning struggle,"I'm at a loss. My almost 12 year old (who is likely ADHD) can not get moving in the morning to save his life. I've been trying to work on proper sleep hygiene with him, and that's a nightly struggle too. He tells me how exhausted he is in the morning, which worries me and I told him we need to see the doctor about it, and then he backpedals and says it's not something to worry about, it's ""just a sometimes thing"" (Which it's not - he's just avoiding). In fact, he will give me every excuse and argument under the sun to avoid doing what he needs to do in the mornings especially.

He's not necessarily avoiding school though - he's got an active social life, he gets decent grades and is a generally happy kid. But given the choice to sleep in, miss school, avoid responsibility and play video games all day, he 100% would. 

I have tried to talk to him kindly. I've given him melatonin at night. I make sure he's not on screens when he's supposed to be in bed. I've worked incredibly hard to not lose my temper, and there's been steady improvement on my part. I've given him lots of options in how to get up in the morning, I've done EVERYTHING I can think of to do. He still gives me massive pissy attitude about it and can barely drag himself to do anything in the morning which frustrates both of us. 

Short of quitting my job and home schooling (which would be a disaster for other reasons too) - what do I do with this? Is this just going to be a daily misery for both of us for the foreseeable future? I've got a lot going on myself right now and I'm not going to drag him into it, but his attitude is not helping and I'm trying desperately not to let it trigger me either."

BulkyMoney2,2021-04-16 14:49:43+00:00,Traveling During Pandemic?,"Hey there

How many of you have traveled during the pandemic? With a toddler in tow? 😅

I am taking my son on a 4.5 hour road trip for his 1st birthday, but I am more so asking about international travel involving a plane. I am turning 30 this summer &amp; I’d like to take my son on a trip with me. He’d be 1 year old. 

Might be important to add that my son has had COVID already. In fact, his father had it too, but I never became positive. I am planning to get vaccinated at some point (I used to teach, and will eventually need to return to the classroom). The doctors who treated my son claimed that he would have immunity for some time, but again, I understand that this virus is something we’re all still learning about. 

I guess what I’m asking is, if you traveled during the pandemic with a little one, what were some of your fears and how did you resolve them? Also, any tips if you have them. 

Thanks!"
TangoDeltaFoxtrot,2021-04-16 14:42:44+00:00,6yo and 3yo sneaking/taking food ALL the time!,"Title pretty much says the main gist of the problem.  Wife and I have three kids- a 6 year old, 3.5 year old, and a 1.5 year old.  The youngest isn't getting into our food stuff, it's the two older ones. 
 The younger ones have Celiac and have pretty bad reactions to gluten.  We do a good job, we think, of finding foods that all the kids like to eat- we figure if it's a reasonably healthy recipe and the kids beg us to cook it and they eat it all, it's probably a keeper and one that we rotate into the menu frequently.  I say that to point out that we try to make foods that the kids actually enjoy eating.  

We also make a variety of treats such as popcorn, ice cream, brownies, fruit cobblers, cupcakes, etc... maybe every couple weeks or so we make some sort of treat kind of food and usually it's gone in a day or two.  We keep snacks of all kinds in the house- plenty of apples, oranges, bananas, grapes, cheese sticks, yogurt cups and pouches, crackers and cereals for all the kids, veggies like carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a variety of dressings they like to dip them in, bread (gluten free and regular) for sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly, tuna, sandwich meats, corn tortillas so we can make snack quesadillas really fast, we have like a hundred eggs on hand at any given time so we can make scrambled eggs or boiled eggs or whatever it is the kids want to eat.  WE FEED THEM A LOT.

We'll feed them a big breakfast, like with potatoes and eggs and oatmeal and milk and juice and fruit, we let them eat until they are full.  If they really didn't eat enough, we'll ask them to finish at least their eggs or something so they get some protein.

We do still have a number of foods in the home containing gluten, and we do make some meals, maybe for guests or an item for just me or my wife, using gluten (I love to bake).  Our kids are generally pretty good about knowing what they can and can't eat, but they're kids, they don't know all the food stuff.  We have a large drawer in the fridge full of nothing buy stuff for the kids- cheese sticks, fruit, yogurt, and space on a pantry shelf for non-refrigerated items.  THEY STILL TAKE STUFF IN EXCESS AND HIDE AND LIE ABOUT IT.

A few problems with this- they will sometimes get into food that has gluten and end up with bad reactions- it's not bad enough to go to the hospital or life threatening for them, but they will end up with very upset stomachs and can break out in bad rashes.  Also, they will eat so much random crap that they then won't be hungry for their actual meal and will hardly eat at all for dinner, then they'll pillage the pantry overnight and make a giant mess.  

When we ask them why they are taking food, their answer is always the same- ""we were hungry.""  Like, DUDE, you never even asked me for food, not to mention all the food that's already available for you to eat, so I don't buy the ""we were hungry"" answer.  Besides, they're not eating foods that you would eat if you're hungry, they're eating junk food or snack food or sugar.

Here are examples of foods they have eaten (each item was taken or consumed in one night):
-12 bananas
-large plastic container of brown sugar
-24 cheese sticks
-three boxes of cake mix (yes they ate it and made a giant mess)
-three cans of whipped cream (they take whipped cream any time it's in the house, literally the same night we buy it)
-a whole pack of sliced cheese
-8 apples
-10 cadbury creme eggs
-entire pan of brownies
-whole box of instant oatmeal pouches
-12 yogurt cups + 12 yogurt pouches
-half a strawberry rhubarb pie
-an entire cinnamon dessert pizza
-2 lbs of grapes
-1 lb bag of chocolate chips
-1 lb bag of powdered sugar
-4 sticks of butter
-giant canister of hot chocolate mix
-entire case of juice boxes
-all of the baby's gluten free snacks for road trips
-a giant bag of parmesan cheese
-half a 9x13 pan of baked oatmeal (we make this for breakfast sometimes and snacks)

I just don't understand- they have food free for them to take, and they won't touch it most of the time.  They prefer to binge on the junk food at night or while I'm at work and my wife is in her home office for 3-4 hours a day.  They hide all the trash in their room and always lie about it or blame each other.  We have tried locking the fridge and cabinets, but the kids have figured out how to open every kind of lock we can buy at the stores near us.  I mean, I could install actual keyed locks on everything, but that seems ridiculous.

How can we get this to stop?!  There's nothing rational about any of it.  Like, why would they think eating a bag of sugar is what they should eat if they're hungry?  Why don't they just ask for what they want?  We only say 'no' if it's near a meal time or if they refused to eat their meal we will tell them to finish their meal before they get anything extra.  If they ask for something like a bowl of sugary cereal, which we do let them have sometimes, we might offer them something else like an apple or a sandwich.  We frequently will prepare snacks for them throughout the day and even cook extra meals just for them if they have been out playing and say they are starving.  BUT, they will then come downstairs and take 20 cheese sticks while we sleep.  WTF, HELP?!"

When I push her away, she starts laughing and turns it into a game. I try to turn over and ignore her but it doesn't work. I've tried moving away, holding her while she squirms and telling her no, and leaving the room for a few minutes and coming back. 

I could really use some advice or ideas, it's really exhausting and hurts and it takes a lot out of me to remain gentle and patient with her. TIA"
ozarkhome,2021-04-16 14:22:40+00:00,4 year old asking strangers for hugs.,"I'm not sure how to go about curbing this behavior. My 4 year old grandson* has never in his life had a fear of strangers. Lately he's been approaching people anywhere we are, asking their names, telling them his name, asking what they are doing, and asking for a hug. Once he went up to a man and touched the gun the guy had on his waist and asked what is was. We almost went through the roof! (On the inside, we tried to be calm on the outside)

I'm trying to suggest that he asks for high fives instead of hugs but I'd like to get him to slow down on the constant... Introductions? 

He hollered at a jogger the other day asking for a hug. It's just constant.

I've set up an evaluation with a pediatric behavioral psychologist through his pediatrician for some other concerning behavior that's been going on forever. I'll be bringing this up to them as well but wondered if anyone here has experienced similar. His 3 year old sister does not do this although she isn't particularly wary of strangers either.

*Just for clarification, my son and I parent his 2 children together. I have power of attorney for both children.  I am very involved in their upbringing and they spend half their time with Dad and half with me. Mom abandoned them 3 years ago. I am not mom, but I fulfill the mom role."
kimtheresppldying,2021-04-16 14:17:30+00:00,Dealing with lice/neighbors kids,"My 3 year old and I both have head lice and I’m concerned that she got it from the neighbors kid. I’m a stay at home mom and the kids next door are really the only people we come in contact with on a regular basis. The little girl was putting her hair clips on my daughter the other day (in hind sight, I probably should have nipped that in the bud but hind sights 20/20.) 

So the real question here is how do I approach the parents without sounding accusatory, just like a “just to let you know my daughter has lice” ? and how long should I keep my daughter away from them? How do I know if they’ve even treated their kids? 

I have pretty bad social anxiety and I don’t want to be rude but I also don’t want to be battling lice forever. I remember my half sisters ALWAYS had lice growing up."

He does not seem to care about anything except electronics. He consistently refuses to study, won’t allow me to check his work, and rushes through his tests/quizzes so he can have more time to play on his Chromebook. We have removed all electronic privileges, but he has to have his Chromebook because everything at school involves using the school-issued Chromebook This means my normal discipline methods have not been as effective. I have decided that I am going to begin “Job Training” with him to prepare him for the work he will be doing as an adult if he does not care about learning, achievement or his grades. I need ideas for my training program. I have decided to teach him about landscaping and pressure washing this weekend. What other ideas can my fellow Redditors come up with for my new job training program?"
Clopidee,2021-04-16 14:07:07+00:00,"My nephew quacks, is this normal?","My 14 month old nephew saw ducks for the first time about a month ago and learnt what quacking was. Now he'll be playing with a toy or just walking around and go ""wack-wack"" randomly. It's adorable but also as he does it even if there is no reference of ducks for him to see. 

He used to roar/growl whenever he saw a dinosaur or dinosaur-looking creature like a dragon, or if he even heard the word dinosaur, but the quacking is completely random. I thing maybe he just likes the sound? Before roaring he used to kinda sing to himself randomly.

Does anyone else know babies that do this sort of thing?"

But the Main problem is:She used to help me at my car repair shop, and knows how to deactivate or just take it out,I would of course check if it's still operational and there, but it wouldn't take much to just put it on and off.

I'm afraid she'd do it, I wish I could trust her like that, but I've been young, and she got ""those"" kinds of friends that like to always take it to the next step.

I_Ch0se_A_Username,2021-04-16 13:27:59+00:00,Should I take my son on vacation even though he is failing his classes?,"My 14 year old son has been having behavioral issues for the last few years. He has been ignoring his school work and is fairly every class but football. Currently he has 3 classes with averages under 20%.

During remote learning his mother and me (divorced for about 10 years) have tried everything. At first we let him try on his own until we learned he was failing most classes (average of 60%) in most classes.

We tried having him print out his daily assignments and show us each assignment as he turned them in. After a few months we learned that was doing the assignments but not submitting them. Next we tried sitting behind him to make sure he was submitting his assignments but he was still failing. We then learned that he was doing the work then submitting blank files.

We took him to therapy and he told them that he was refusing to do the work because him mom and me were micromanaging him. The therapist suggested giving him more room and seeing if his grades improved. His grades almost immediately dropped an additional 15-20% in every class.

In addition to his grades he has been behaving terribly. Yelling at us, cussing at his younger brother, and refusing to do anything besides talk to his girlfriend. He no longer goes outside or does any of his hobbies unless we force him. When he has his way he just sits in his room texting his gf. We have tried taking away his phone (nearly 6 months this most recent time) and his behavior only got worse. He keeps saying “I’ll behave if you give me my phone back”. But we are refusing to let him make demands like that.

I used to live in Hawaii and typically take a trip back at least once a year to visit friends. I’m preparing to book this trip and his mom and me are stuck on if I should take him or not. His mom and I feel like it would be good for him to get out of the house and spend time with me, but also are worried about treating him to a big trip while he is purposely failing his classes.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated"

pandamonkey23,2021-04-16 11:41:16+00:00,Why don’t people show parents more grace on their learning curve?,"I had a crappy day today with meltdowns galore from my toddler. Some of this occurred in public and I received glares from many (mostly in the retired age bracket). I always feel empathy towards parents who are having a rough day, but I have noticed that whenever a parent struggles on a reality TV show (e.g super nanny) all the comments suggest that everyone else is a perfect parent and they don’t need to reflect/change at all. The comments are always “my child would never have dared to a/b/c” and the parent is described as “weak”. Why is that people are allowed to struggle in so many areas (sports/school/body image etc), but if you struggle in parenting it’s like you are a lesser person? Where is the grace and compassion? To me parenting is the thing I am most invested in and I’m trying my very best to get it right. But I am learning!! A sympathetic smile would have gone a long way today."
duk31nlondon,2021-04-16 11:38:26+00:00,14Y old son rejects everything but video games and watching TV,"We're 2 weeks in the Easter break and our son has done virtually nothing apart from playing GTA online and watch TV. After a weeks on holiday we realized he was breaking the 4h screen time limit we set him by also playing at night. In parallel, he'd done none of the exams preparation he'd said he would do as condition of him getting this screen time allowance.

I am worried about his attitude to everything else.  

On homework, at best he pretends doing something by writing a few lines of vocabulary or sentences from revisions books but on discussing with him, it's clear he doesn't know what his notes are about. Any question about how much he plans to do gets him angry. 

When asked about the reading list issued by his school, his answer was that he bought a book. it turned out to be a book recommended for children around 10 years old. 

Outdoors sports (he plays Hockey) has restarted but he the news training was restarting got a shrug from him. None of everything he got to try with our without us (sailing/tennis/football/rugby/MTB) gets his vote and everything seems too much of an effort.

So it feels like he'll do anything (sleep deprivation, lying) for some screen time but has at best contempt about everything else.

Is this something that requires outside help ? Can other parents can relate to and have seen improving over time ? What seemed to help ?"

RiceCakeMuffin,2021-04-16 09:41:57+00:00,A story I'm sure all parents can relate to.,"Here is a true story  I sent my family on the 27th of December last year that I have only just felt at peace with to share!


Today as we travelled back home, car stuffed to the nines belly's full and tired from Evies 0400 shenanigans, we thought nothing could go wrong.

Evie was ready for a nap and we left and made good time. Till Cooma. When the wailing started. And kept going.

Everytime I turned around Evie smiled and was happy. So here I am playing with Evies feet blowing raspberries and eventually I get sick of the games and shove her dummy back in.

The wailing continued around the dummy till she spat it out. It landed in her lap and Dad reached his hand into her lap and there it was, the dummy, and the litteral shitstorm Evie was sitting in. We had only 20 mins before discussed how the size 2 shorts we got her were too tight.

By the time we could pull over there was baby poop everywhere over evie. She had spread it up her nose, in her hair, in her mouth and all over her car seat. Dad had a handful and there was a dummy coated.

Its 32 degrees so the flies instantly swarm us. The nappy gets kicked out and slides down my leg. All three of us have have now been tarred with the same brush. The carseat requires forensic cleaning and size 2 shorts were abandoned. We ran out of wet wipes in easy reach and accepted that some things will never be the same. And now we have returned to our travels with new fly friends a smell that lingers and a still crying baby."

2. What's the minimum i can get by with the baby? seriously? I have on my list carseat, probably a stroller, but a blank on what else. I'm thinking more 2nd hand, usable (easy for me to get on the kid, and wash, rather than cute)."

TARS1986,2021-04-16 04:09:47+00:00,Tired of feeling guilty,"Title says it all, and if you’re reading this as a parent you know what parental guilt feels like. 

I’m just stuck in this endless cycle of guilt with my kids (3 year old and 3 month old). The guilt is 99% from my relationship with my 3 year old. 3 month old and I are cool for the most part.

The 3 year old has just cut me to my core. She has the most intense personality traits of both my wife and I (my inability to focus, and my anxiety - and my wife’s strong willed nature and temper). She’s absolutely a fun and loving kid - she makes me laugh a ton, has some really sweet moments of unprovoked demonstrations of love and compassion, and can carry a tune like she’s much older. I love her very much. 

However, because of her personality and my personality, not a single day goes by without some sort of serious drama where I lose my cool and then feel guilty for failing. Theres’s some guilt. Or, if I can’t play with her or give her attention she looks so dejected. I could be working, exercising, or just truly trying to catch a breather and zone out for 2 minutes on my phone. The fact that I can’t spend all available time with her (and honestly I don’t want to), I feel guilty too. Like I’m letting her down. Or when I’m rushing her and just seem to only care about what I need to get done, I’m not considering her pace or feelings. It’s adapt to my needs or I’ll get upset. Again, more guilt. 

I’m just sick of this. I’m sick of feeling so guilty all the time and feeling like every day is a failure in parenting. I’m not sure if other parents here feel the same, but I’m hoping I’m not alone."

Your kid can tell you got them Emu boots instead of Uggs, or that their new coat very clearly says Canada *Duck* on the side.

I’ve had a 3.9 or higher gpa my entire time in school because of all the pressure from my parents, but it’s starting to catch up with me and have been dealing with what I presume is depression (I feel unmotivated at all times and even when I want to do something my mind just doesn’t let me do it and I have these existential thoughts that everything I do is pointless because we all die).

VaginalChristmas,2021-04-16 03:35:17+00:00,Sleep nightmares,"Our son is 3.5yo and just returned to preschool after a year of being at home with us. During that year a lot happened: he stopped napping, has a new baby sister, got potty trained, and we moved to a new house. The issue we are having now that he’s returned to school is with sleep because he started napping at school again.

He has always been a good sleeper and has historically gotten to sleep pretty easily, especially since kicking his nap. Bedtime was 7:30 and he’d wake up between 6-7am. A total dream. Now that he’s back in school 3 days a week and napping on those days, those three days are horrific at bed time and throughout the nights, too (usually). We pushed his bedtime to 8pm but it’s still taking him ages to fall asleep. Last night it took him until 10pm. It’s been very hard because we also have a newborn and the overall lack of sleep...let’s just say we are tired and don’t need more sleep issues. 

The director of the school says he is very against any of the kids not napping from a safety standpoint— they play hard and need a break. He says our son is falling asleep when it’s time to power down and I believe him. We don’t want to do our son a disservice— if he’s exhausted at nap time then shouldn’t he take a nap? Yes, of course. And they assure us the naps he takes are 30-40 minutes. But they are clearly fucking with his sleep at night and it’s making him over tired and cranky because he can’t get to sleep and stay asleep. 

We don’t know what to do. Any advice?"

Mom and all 4 kids have been sharing a room/bed since November but yet she just financed herself a brand new 2021 suv and is taking  4 kids on a plane to Calgary in 1 week... but can’t afford to move out of a bedroom with her 4 kids. My partner and I both work decent jobs with great benefits, have a 3 bedroom townhouse where the kids have their own rooms, the kids tell us daily (when he have them) how much they want to live with us and hate being at moms, it’s heart breaking when they have to leave, they bawl the whole way back home. We are
Currently going through family court but due to covid almost everything has been halted, we’ve reached out to CAS with our safety concerns for the child and so far nothings been done, and unfortunately we can’t afford a lawyer/don’t qualify for legal aid so I’m just at a loss, I love these babies like my own and I hurt seeing them hurt, but I’m very careful not to over step as I’m just “dads girlfriend” I let mom and dad handle the business.

Ok on to the Drama part.. .. like I mentioned, she is taking her 4 kids to Calgary (from London, ON) to visit family for 3 weeks, which my partner disagrees with for a few reasons, in Ontario we’re currently in a “Stay at home” order but she’s flying from Ontario to Calgary just to *visit family*, he will be missing 2 court mandated visits with his kids, and Calgary’s covid numbers in youth are scary high. I told my partner that  due to my work, the children can’t be at our house for 2 weeks after their back, I work in a covid vaccine clinic and have to report if I or anyone around me has travelled, and I have to stay home if so. Not only that, but she’s putting her children in unnecessary risk that I’m not willing to have exposed to my 2 year old. I love all our babies but I need to keep my home, family and employment safe. Me requesting a 2 week quarantine once they return has started a HUGE battle with the ex AND my mother in law, they both think I’m trying to keep my partner away from his kids, being selfish and putting my son before his children but that’s not the case and I’m not changing my mind. My mother in law has blocked and deleted me from EVERYTHING and the ex is refusing to give us our weekend with the kids before they leave because “if you don’t want to see them until 2 weeks after they return, you don’t need to see them now” apparently she has always been awful but I’ve only been with my partner for 18 months now and I’m still adjusting... but am I wrong for requesting A two week quarantine and sticking to it?"

How do I negotiate parental leave?,"I am currently employed at an okay job with poor work/life balance and very ready for a change. Excitingly enough, I just received a job offer for a position that I’ve been interviewing for over the past 4 weeks- AND I also JUST found out that I’m ~5 weeks pregnant with my first child (x5 positive at-home pregnancy tests can’t ALL be wrong- can they? 😅). My husband and I are very excited for both events, but for obvious reasons the timing isn’t great for them to both happen at the same time. 

The benefits packaged PDF I received doesn’t talk about parental leave specifics or eligibility. I’m also so early in my pregnancy that my OBGYN won’t even see me until 8 weeks, and I’m not disclosing to anyone in my circle until it’s actually confirmed by my OB. 

I from digging around online and Glassdoor, I’ve been able to scrounge up that this new company offers good parental leave, but may likely require employment for 12 months for eligibility. So I guess my questions are as follows-

1.) Is parental leave eligibility negotiable? 

2.) How do I have this discussion with HR without saying I’m pregnant since I’m so early in the first trimester? 

3.) Should I disclose that I am pregnant before accepting the job officially? I hate the idea of going into a new job not being completely honest, but am afraid of early repercussions of it too. 

4.) Any other advice or similar experiences to share? I want to handle this the best way so I can be successful at my new job and start it on the right foot the best I can.

As a wife and a mother, it's something I'm working hard to relearn. I feel confident in my communication skills with my spouse. But when it comes to my daughter, Im struggling. I've never seen a parent apologize to their child and my recent attempts felt inadequate.

maryberrysphylactery,2021-04-16 01:50:10+00:00,Health visitor shaming our sleep pattern,"We currently have a 2.5 week old baby and we are receiving the home visits from the health visitor (UK). The baby is healthy and thriving but like most newborns he struggles to sleep unless held. 

As a result my wife and I sleep in 2-3 hour shifts, with the other staying awake holding him. This has worked well and ensures that both of us get about 6 hours sleep in total a day. 

The health visitor keeps ranting to us though how we need to get out of this habit because it isn't sustainable for us, especially when. I go back to work. She keeps telling us we need quality sleep, 4 hours at a time and together as a couple, but this seems totally out of touch with wha having a newborn is like. He isn't a dog I can't just train him in a few days to sleep 4 hour stints on his own. 

We tried sleeping her way again and it's left us both with about an hours sleep, and too tired to take shifts from each others so how is that more sustainable when I'm working again?

Partly I'm renting but I'm interested if anyone has some input on newborn sleeping. We have a bedside crib and Moses basket and currently use a arms up swaddle sleep sack thingy or arms out sleep sacks. He can sleep 2 hour stints sometimes in the moses basket occasionally but it's not super reliable yet. 

Mostly I'm just s bit tired of having s healthy thriving 2.5 week old baby, and both parents being tested and functional and STILL being made to feel like we are doing it wrong by the professionals."
SweetNo8122,2021-04-16 01:44:04+00:00,Can you get PPD when kids are 3 and 5?,"Throw away. 

I love my kids and was obsessed with them when they were babies. I think I was skin to skin contact for two months, breastfed, everything. Then... I got depressed. I think it’s because I stopped taking care of myself and going out because i was all about my kids. 

Now they are 3 and 5 and holy shit, I can’t do it, the whining, complaining, fighting, throwing trash, spilling everything, etc. 

I can’t have anything nice, can’t ever have a clean house, no alone time. I try not to yell much but when I do it’s when I hit the top and I raise my voice loud. I never cuss or hit. But really inside I just wanna scream. I’m a horrible mom now. Don’t even know if this is me or if I’m depressed anymore. 

I’m in my bathtub crying right now. Googling “I don’t want to be a mom anymore” but the thought of ever losing them makes me sick to my stomach, I’d probably die of heartbreak if I ever lost them. So why am I like this? 

When my kid yells that he hates me it really hurts my feelings. I feel I give everything I have, I give the kids everything and I get nothing in return. Not even a clean house. I buy something nice, they break it. I replace the carpet they spill on it. 
 
Then I sit here feeling horrible because I’m gonna look back at this time and wish I could see them this little again but in the moment I’m struggling. I feel like I’m ruining them. 

I think about my previous life. I was happy, I had friends, I had money. I could have paid all debt off by now but ha!!! Not even close when I have to pay $1600 a month for daycare. 

I’m a bad mom. 

Now I’m just venting and saying things I wish I could say out loud. I feel like shit for feeling like this which brings me down even more on top of what I’m already feeling. 

I don’t even know who I am anymore. And the sad thing about it is they are preschool all day so I barley see them and still feel like this. 

My husband had them one day and they were great, the moment I get home they act completely different. Start whinnying, fighting, constant touching me. DH says “they weren’t like this 5 minutes ago” must be nice."
gluuey,2021-04-16 01:43:06+00:00,How do I make my almost 5 yo child like school?,"A little bit of background: our son has been staying at home with me (Dad) since birth while my wife works. He’s always been a little cooped up and overprotected but well, he is our first born, so I guess most parents are guilty of this. Or what do I know...maybe not.

Anyhow, we tried preschool about a year ago but the wasn’t ready psychologically or emotionally, so we pulled him out. It was too hard for him and he would sincerely cry, not sleep at night and be sad to a point where at the time, we thought the best decision was to let him mature more before trying school again. Next year he will be going to Kindergarten, and we decided to send him to a small preschool in a small class for 6 weeks before the summer for him to get his feet wet. His teacher is great and caring, we try to be as supportive and positive as possible.

Today was his second day in school, and he has been doing okay although he seems stressed and physically and emotionally more tired than usual. He also isn’t eating anything there (picky), which is not helping. He has started telling me he doesn’t want to go back the next day and bombarding me with questions all day long about why he needs to go to school, why he can’t stay at home, why I (his father) can’t stay at school with him...

He’s a smart kid, and he’s asking himself too many questions. He is extremely stubborn too. It seems like he’s just waiting for the day to pass by and me to pick him up when he’s there. I’ve tried telling him he should try to have fun and time will go by more quickly. I’m just running out of ideas of what to tell him so he will understand school is important and have a positive attitude. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Let me preface this by saying I have no problem with the lgbt+ community. I’m a silent member of the community myself. 

So about 6-9 months ago, my stepdaughter got a secret phone from her bio mother. Her mother told her not to tell her father and I that she had a phone. She spends her time on tiktok and discord and since discovering furries and the lgbt community she is absolutely convinced she’s lesbian and a boy. We supported her choice to come out as a lesbian. Then she changed &amp; said she was a boy. She changes her mind weekly about her pronouns (he/her) and I’m at my wits end. 

Last night she had her phone taken at the end of the evening, (this is the routine at home) and she lost her temper with her father, saying she should be treated like an adult. He said “I speak with you like you’re an adult because I value your opinion and your feelings, but you’re a 12 year old girl. You will be treated like a 12 year old girl.” 
She waited for her father and I to go to bed before leaving a note at our door saying “if she can’t be a boy then she’s leaving “

We spent the night searching for her, involving the police and filing a missing person report. 

When they located her a few hours later, they called us and told her she was safe and we were not to go near her. She had told them (the police) she was scared of us. 

I’m currently waiting for the police to return her home. I’m so anxious and angry about this whole escalation and I honestly don’t know how to react or even remotely what the appropriate way to handle this is. Please help."

I have a 5 year old son and we talk about appropriate and inappropriate behavior. We don't talk about strangers because I know the majority of people are abused by people they know.

My mom has been staying for over a month to help out, but she volunteers half her day and is just kinda too tired for a baby and a toddler. 
My partner took their brother to dinner to get him out of the house (he’s primary caregiver for the parents, all day long). 
I stayed home with the baby, the toddler, my mom, brother, the childcare provider who just quit. I tried to eat dinner with both kids climbing on me. Nobody offered to try to take one. They finished and cleared the table while I put the baby to bed. My toddler is watching iPad (allowed after dinner), my mom and brother went to go watch a movie. I wanted to see it but they didn’t want to wait for me. Fine, okay. I wanted to eat some more food.
My partner texts me from the restaurant. 
“Did you turn on a movie?” 
I said no, mom did. 
They said “what is (the toddler) doing?” 
I said watching some videos while I eat.

My husband would really like us to pierce her ears before she’s a year old because they are “cute” and also because he’s worried that if she wants earrings when she gets older, she will be too afraid to get them.

I think he’s hanging onto this too much because she’s his little princess. I think we should just wait to see if she even wants earrings when she gets older, maybe 4 or 5 years old at the earliest. Since I have the only woman perspective in this marriage, he’s ultimately going to defer to me on it but I still am open for discussion. 

I finally pierced my own ears when I was 17. Sterilized a safety pin with fire, cleaned my ear lobe, stabbed it in there, and then kept it clean. Ended up never really wearing earrings. They get stuck in my long hair too much and I don’t do “updos” except for a messy bun or tight ponytail. But mostly my hair is down all the time. 

Come to find out, my husband sort of wishes I wore earrings 🙄 I think they are annoying. I wear my wedding ring and the occasional bracelet/necklace for date night and that’s it.

Upon further discussion, she informs us it’s a problem all the time and asks for medicine (kids motrin). 

We are working with various medical folks to try and diagnose a problem, but so far everything is coming up clean (blood tests, x rays, various other assessments). This is starting to get difficult as we obviously don’t want to medicate her every day, and yet she is adamant her knee(s) hurt every night without fail. Our “solution” currently is to give her a placebo which appears to work. 

I’m not looking for medical advice, but would love the perspective of any parents who have gone through something similar. My #1 fear is being a parent who ignores the danger signs of a more serious condition, so we attempt to seek medical attention as frequently as we can on the subject. At the same time, despite apparently having sore knees “all the time”, she never reports an issue outside of bedtime - notably a time of day she frequently tries to push boundaries. It’s hard to know whether this is a bid for attention / to deflect away from the task at hand (going to bed), and is overall quite a pickle. 

If folks have gone through something similar, I’d love to hear guidance!"

spkygrrl,2021-04-15 23:52:55+00:00,6 YO jealous of 3.5 YO,"The girls largely play well together and occasionally squabble, over a toy or the rules of a game. The standard way we handle it is by encouraging them to handle it themselves which works well most of the time. Sometimes they’ve had enough of each other and take a break from playing, but get back to it with a new game together within a half hour without being promoted. 

The issue is 3.5 is super sweet and supportive of 6, but 6 is very jealous of 3.5. Some examples that are getting to be too much: 6 is in 3 days of in-person school, 3.5 has 2 days of 3 hour pre-k. When 6 was a toddler, we took her to all sorts of museums, classes, zoo, etc. 3.5 has not gotten this, because of COVID and being a younger sibling (the older’s pre-k schedule had to be worked around). Last week I took 3.5 to zoo while 6 was at school. 6 was a wreck about it because it “isn’t fair.” Screamed, kicked, thrashed about, and cried for over an hour about it after school. And even when calm this week she says whining things to us and 3.5 like “It makes me soooo sad nobody took me to the zoo... 3.5 gets her way soo much but I never do.” This happens ANY TIME 3.5 does anything without 6 - but when 6 gets a special outing or treat, she essentially brags and rubs it in 3.5’s face. “I get to go to dinner with mama and you have to stay here!” etc. even though 3.5 - bless her heart - is usually just excited for 6 and says so. To 6 it is unfair she had to go to the orthodontist, that 3.5 got a braid in her hair for picture day (though 6 gets braids just as often if not more because she’ll sit for them better), 3.5 had a longer spring break, 3.5 got to go to the zoo alone, 3.5 had a birthday party at all (6 threw such a fit the whole day because attention wasn’t on her), or even that one dinner we went to a place all of us like that 6 didn’t think she’d like (though every other dinner virtually ever is a place both girls like AND 6 ended up loving the food at this place). 

I am at a loss on what to do. We are modeling as well as we can. We don’t force them to be friends, but they are usually friends. 6 seems to blame us more so than 3.5. We let them work out small issues and we step in with bigger ones but we listen to both sides. They don’t share a room, we respect their right to play alone, we give 6 plenty of solo time... it’s just getting to be so hard. I don’t want to invalidate her feelings but it’s so annoying at this point that most of the time it feels easier to just slight 3.5 and not take her out because she doesn’t mind! Her rivalry concerns involve toys or counting how many M&amp;Ms they both get, not special events or simple outings. This is obviously not a good solution because it GENUINELY isn’t fair to 3.5 but 6 is impossible and we are at a loss on what to do. Any help is appreciated!!! 

TL;DR: 6 YO is jealous of 3 YO getting any solo  attention or outings, but 3 YO is happy for 6 YO getting attention or outings. 6 YO will throw huge fits about the smallest perceived unfairness, like 3 going to zoo or 6 having to go to orthodontist. Desperate for some help! Thx!"

I’m wondering what everyone’s thoughts are on what the appropriate age is for letting your child play outside by themself? 

My daughter is 8, only child. We live in a very quiet neighborhood. Her friends want her to go play at the park which is so close. There is one house behind us and you cross the street and you’re at the park. Takes about 30 seconds to walk there. I feel strange letting her go alone but I see a lot of other kids go play daily without their parents and am wondering if I should give her some freedom. We’ve only been in the neighborhood for about a week and a half as we just moved so I think that’s playing a role too, I’m sure. I’m a pretty cautious parent and just want to know if I’m being too suffocating or if others would hesitate as well! 

She feels ready and wants to go, she’s responsible enough for an 8 yo.

Any thoughts are appreciated!!"

I've tired taking the things he throws and putting them up for x amount of minutes, and he'll do good for a day and throw it again the next day. Ignoring behaviors we don't want doesn't seem to effect him bc its like he doesn't really care if we are ignoring him. I use a firm voice when telling him he shouldn't do something, when tantrums arise I tell him that I get it its rough not being able to get the words out or the sock doesn't want to cooperate etc.. im out of ideas and feel like I'm not doing something right. 

When I talk with my folks I'm told I'm too soft, that when I was a child I only had a screaming tantrum once before they ""set me straight"",  I should use a more harsh voice with him. I know they mean I should scare him, or physically force him to do what I want him to do."

 I keep seeing “heal yourself before you have children” and I didn’t realize unaddressed childhood trauma comes back to rear its ugly head until after my son was born. I am in no way negative or angry towards my son, but it’s a different story with my husband (the emotional abuse I suffered as a kid comes out) and I become a completely different person.

I hate it so much, and I want so desperately to change my behavior. Has anyone found any resources (podcasts, books, etc.) to overcome/heal from childhood trauma? 

Sidenote: I am currently in therapy to do the inner work as well."

I’m literally losing my mind from stress and anxiety because my 3 month old won’t allow me to leave her with anybody to watch her. I’m headed back to work in less than a month and I just don’t know what to do. The plan was to get a nanny to watch her but the previous one we had just made her cry from the moment she touched her in the morning, until she left in the late afternoon so we just had to let her go. What can I do to get her to just get along with others? Or at least let others to look after her? Pleaseeee help!"
Totengeist,2021-04-15 22:10:44+00:00,Occam's razor before MacGyver,"We bought our toddler a VTech baby phone when he was about a year old and he loved it. He played with it everywhere. It eventually ended up in the car somehow and helped him deal with long drives. My point being it got a *lot* of use.

Eventually it stopped working properly. The slider that switches from ""music"" to ""apps"" had been misaligned for over a month already and finally the ""touchscreen"" stopped working. The physical buttons still worked fine.

Since having kids, I've been preparing myself for low quality toys that need to be replaced occasionally. I'm an IT technician and am fairly comfortable dealing with simple electronics and my wife is also very tech-savvy, so we grabbed a screw driver and carefully pulled the toy apart.

I was expecting poor soldering to have caused a loose connection, but after fixing the misaligned slider there were no other issues to be found. After several minutes of fruitless checking, it dawns on us: the batteries are dying.... Apparently, there was enough current to power the buttons and slider, but not the touchscreen.

I've worked in IT for over a decade and forgot what almost amounts to turning it off and on again. Advice I give on a regular basis at work.

We've since had to take apart a Linkimal with a wonky switch and were successful in that endeavor, so I was able to redeem myself.

TLDR: A toy wasn't working properly, so we took it apart only to eventually realize the problem was dying batteries, not mechanical failure. When a toy is acting up, always try replacing the batteries before performing surgery."
yromeM_yggoF,2021-04-15 22:10:06+00:00,Pre-school for 3 year old. What would you do?,"I want to get some other parents’ opinions, because I have mixed feelings on this. I am a high school teacher at a small private school, and I have the opportunity to have my son go here for free next year, and he would be in pre-school (he will be 3 this week). My wife stays home with our newborn and 3 year old son, so I know it can be difficult for her to keep them both happy, so on the one hand, this could give my son a lot more interaction with other kids and help with his social development. Plus, he would be near me, which is another benefit, as I can see him at lunch and recess sometimes. I also trust the teachers here, we have the same beliefs, the classes are smaller, there’s not a lot of discipline issues, and a free private school education is hard to beat.

However, I have a few reservations. The school is in a major city, and we live about an hour away in a small rural area, so when he makes friends, they won’t live nearby. I’ve heard the closest district to our home is good, but I don’t know personally. Also, if I were to ever leave my school (not saying I will, just an “if”) we can’t afford the tuition, so he would have to change schools. Also, just as far as starting my son at 3 goes, I have mixed feelings as well. We live on 17 wooded acres, so part of me wants him to just be able to run around and be a kid for a long as possible before going to school. But again, my wife is very occupied with our newborn, so he might not be outside as much as he used to be.

And that’s my dilemma. I’m a major over-thinker,  so I’d love to see how some of you weigh these pros and cons, what you’d lean to, your experiences, or any thoughts you have."
highinisolation,2021-04-15 22:05:00+00:00,My mom is “forcing” me into being a pilot,"I’m 19 and in my first year of college. I’m going to a school with a good aviation program, which my mom has encouraged because she strongly believes I’ll love being a pilot. I do very much love traveling. Soon, I have to apply to get into the actual aviation program but I don’t REALLY want to. I kind of feel like she’s forcing me to do something I don’t want to do. And I’ve told her before that I don’t really want to pursue being a pilot but she always blows me off, and says wait til you first get in that pilot seat.

It all started my senior year of high school, when she got me a private flight for my 18th bday in Arizona which I did love but she always says it’s when “I fell in love with flying” but no that’s just what she wants to think

It was soon later she discovered I had been a daily weed smoker, but that didn’t deter her from wanting me to be a pilot. I actually quit weed 2 months ago, but I still want to go back to that and just not pursue being a pilot.

The struggle I have tho is that I don’t know what else I would want to do besides being a pilot. Because I suck at most things and I never want a desk job. I also have an amazing busboy job, in which I make average of 22 dollars an hour. So she thinks I will just get stuck working in restaurants my whole life. Which I don’t want

I really want to sit down and talk with her again and tell her how I feel, but she has always insisted on being the type of mom who “doesn’t force her child to do what they don’t want to do” yet she is forcing me into this. I think she doesn’t even see what she’s doing. What can I say to get through to her?"

I am exhausted with parenting and at my limit. I have a ten year old autistic/adhd son and I had a mental breakdown today and not sure how to move forward.

It's just me and my ex girlfriend raising him. No one else. Neither of us have parents (mine are dead, so are hers). Im estranged from my family who live in another state, and she only has 4 relatives she talks to who live 6 hours away.

Needless to say it sucks. Our son has basically no family outside of us. We can't afford any child care, so when we broke up 3 years ago we have been passing him between the two houses every day. My ex works day shift and i work night shift. So I get him during the day and she watches him at night.

However it's clear I got the worst deal. Before the pandemic every single fucking school day I would get a call during my sleep hours (I sleep during the day because I work late nights) about his behavior or have to pick him up. During the pandemic it's worse because he's distance learning so now im basically a teacher during my sleep hours. It was fine for the few months I was unemployed but now I'm back at work and losing my mind.

I'm sleep deprived and angry all the time. I scream at my son over everything. Every little thing upsets me. I'm resenting him and my situation.

I have no social life since i watch him 6 days a week since my ex also works Saturday for extra hours. I have not dated once since the break up because I don't have time! How can I date when I'm never free?

It's causing me to hate my child and I feel horrible. I cannot get therapy as I literally have no time. Every hour that cuts into my sleep causes me distress. 

Hell this week I had to not only do school stuff with my son but take him to several doctor appointments and got 4 hours of sleep a day. I'm beyond done. I keep counting the days till he is 18 and I can leave forever. I feel terrible for thinking this. I feel if I just was given the chance to sleep and have a life I wouldn't feel this way about my son. Our relationship is suffering. My ex will not cut hours as she needs the over time to afford bills. I am now reliant on sleep meds to get any sleep and I hate it. 
I hate meds in general.

spoopypoopydoops,2021-04-15 21:27:58+00:00,I think my child inherited anxiety,"My daughter 6F is wonderful in so many ways. I feel really lucky to be her mom and want to do the best I can for her. Her dad (my ex) and I both have anxiety disorders, and she is exhibiting some signs of anxiety. I intend to speak to her doctor about it soon, but I'm currently unable to drive due to a recently broken leg, so it will have to wait a few weeks sadly.

I'm not asking for medical advice of course, but I'm wondering if anyone has read any helpful books about raising an anxious child that I should check out. Every child deals with big feelings that we must teach them how to cope with, but I have a limited skillet on helping a small child navigate anxiety. I have tried deep breathing techniques, yoga, talking it out, etc, but it doesn't seem to be helping very much.

As I said, I do intend to speak to a doctor, and I intend to find a child therapist to assist her, but until I'm more mobile, I think learning about childhood anxiety may help me help her.

And to add before I get questions, no, she has not had a particularly difficult life. Her father and I split when she was 1, and she has a wonderful relationship with her father, her stepfather, and myself. All of her needs are being met, and we support her hobbies and interests. We do not yell or use corporal punishment. She has friends and family that love her, and we have a few pets that bring us a lot of love and joy. I think it's just an unfortunate genetic trait she may have inherited."
brawnyfuzzball,2021-04-15 21:21:11+00:00,Divorce father looking for some advice.,As stated I am a divorced father. The opportunity to be with my children is limited due to work schedule and our custody rotation. With this time being limited  I feel it would be selfish of me if I kept them away from their friends and after school activities while it was my time with them. So I often let them go to friends and other activities unless we have special plans.  I also struggle with fear of people seeing me as someone that just lets his kids go and don't spend time with them. I want my kids to have great friendships and build relationships with their peers but the same time I feel like  I'm losing bonding moments with my children.

LookingForHobbits,2021-04-15 20:55:07+00:00,Independent 2yo Troubles,"Hoping that some of you have been through this before and might have some resources we can look into. 

We have a very bright newly two year old who is amazing... until you try to transition him to an activity he doesn't want to do. If he's willing he'll just follow/lead you to the next task/activity without issue, but when he's engaged in something he doesn't want to stop (ie: playing outside or taking a bath) he'll throw massive tantrum when it comes time to move on to the next thing, or even for a momentary break (like a diaper change).

We weren't too concerned with this when it happened at home as it's typically near the start/end of the day and we assumed he was just tired or hungry on top of being a two year old but we just had a conference with daycare and it turns out this now happens every time they come in from playing outside, every nap, and every diaper change. It's becoming very disruptive and even their most experienced staff are stumped because things that motivate other toddlers don't seem to work on ours. 

Once you get him to start a new activity he's usually fine, and if you're willing to wait 15 minutes he'll typically willingly move on to the next task (so he'll say ""no"" to a diaper change and instead play with toys but then he'll suddenly decide he's ready and get changed. Also before it's suggested: he has no interest in potty training yet and a perfect poker face) but that's not something that daycare can reasonably do.

Any ideas or resources would be helpful."

I'm really frustrated with my parents, mostly my mom, it just seems like she wants nothing to do with my kids, they are my step kids but I consider them my children. It just seems like every time we need help with anything at all my mom tries and finds a way to get out of it completely she'll come up with excuses and pretty much just break our hearts every time we try to ask for help.

It's gotten to the point where me and my wife feel like we can't even depend on my mom for anything, my wife's parents help us out with everything and anything they can at any moment no matter what. When it comes to my parents though we might as well just not even ask, we even ask a week ahead of time to make sure there's plenty of time to make plans but instead of saying sure she'll tell us let me make sure I'm not doing anything this weekend first, which means to me let me make plans first so that I can cancel on y'all.

Reality-Check-2019,2021-04-15 20:28:39+00:00,My child won't stop holding food in his mouth,"My son is almost 2. 

I'm struggling to get him to eat properly (as a lot of parents do). I'm working on that and slowly getting him to eat a variety of foods. 

But my biggest struggle has been he likes to hold food in his mouth. I will literally catch him with food in his mouth almost an hour after a meal. And it's not always a lot of food. It's just small little chunks I find in the back of his cheeks. Then I'm forced to have to get it out with my fingers. And now he has a mouth full of teeth so it's like sticking my finger into a piranhas mouth. 

I tried only giving him a few bites of food on his plate at a time but it's still happening. Even if I cut his food into tiny peices. 

Has anyone else had this problem? I really need some advice on how to fix this. I know it can really mess up his teeth if this doesn't stop. 

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!"
sarawrrra,2021-04-15 20:17:34+00:00,Just turned 3 year old having constant meltdowns,"Hello parents! My daughter just turned 3 at the end of March and she started preschool the Monday after her birthday. She was good for about a week, but then it was like a switch flipped. Constant tantrums, never ending screaming. From what I’ve been reading it sounds rather normal, I think, but my husband and I are definitely struggling with the screaming.

She’s been doing great at school, so no problems there. I was thinking it might just be her adjusting to the new routine but it’s been three weeks now and she’s just barely starting to have better days. Part of it has definitely been me, because the screaming gets me so stressed out that I have unfortunately reacted poorly, but I have been working very hard to maintain my composure and model the behavior that I have wanted to see. Up until yesterday, there were multiple tantrums every day at things not going her way and also at nap and bedtime. Our routine will go fairly smoothly and then once it’s time for me to leave the room, she will get up and scream and cry. If I go back and comfort her, she will be fine while I am there and then lose it again the second I turn to leave. We have been letting her cry it out at that point, and had gotten the crying time down to only two minutes and then finally she went down without a fight yesterday. Today, she screamed at me the whole time we changed into her pull up so she got a consequence of no stories before bed, which obviously didn’t go over well and resulted in more screaming. 

I guess I’m just looking for some validation that we’re not torturing her by letting her cry it out. Some advice that I’ve read has said not to do that, but if we keep going back in to her room the cycle just repeats itself and she will go on forever.  I’m also looking for some advice on how to deal with the tantrums. I’ve heard the basic “tell them it’s okay to be upset, it’s not okay to scream at mommy” but I can’t do that until she’s stopped screaming, and she can go on for quite a while. 

For some background, she has a speech delay and has been in speech therapy and has moved into preschool, which has helped tremendously with her language skills. She is trying so many new words daily. She is my first baby and I hardly have any other experience with kids her age, so it can be hard to tell what is normal and what is not. 

So, fellow parent warriors, what advice and commiseration can you give me?  TIA!"
Nearby_Golf,2021-04-15 20:03:20+00:00,"We stopped play dates bec of COVID, another parent disagrees and was disrespectful","Sorry for the long post. And thank you in advance for listening.... My 3yr old son is bffs with our 3yr old neighbor who lives a few houses down. They just click and always happy and excited to see each other. Our families spent a lot of time together last summer (without masks) since we were all careful and all work from home. Until the husband went back to work and got exposed to COVID frequently. We stopped hanging out with them when I would find out that the husband would get tested for covid and it appears to me that they are not properly quarantining and still went on play dates with us. I just absolutely do not trust the mother because my son (and the rest of my family) also have gotten sick a couple of times in the past because she would allow her daughter play with my son even though she’s running fever with cough and congestion. Her main priority is about her daughter not socializing enough with other kids.

So we haven’t seen them for a few months, and they stopped by the other day  to drop off my son’s bday present. I told her that we started spending time with the grandparents who are diabetics and with heart conditions so we are still careful. Me and my son wore our masks and they didn’t, which I thought was disrespectful. She said that “they are so over COVID” and I see on Facebook that they go to a lot of indoor places and go to gatherings without masks. I honestly don’t have anything against that. The level of protection that you do for covid is your own personal choice. It’s none of my business. She also said that she doesn’t understand why I still don’t let my son play with her daughter because her in laws who live next door to them are already fully vaccinated. I don’t know what she meant by that, it didn’t make sense to me. She also said other things that I couldn’t understand. And I just didn’t appreciate the tone of her voice at all. We saw them across the street a few days ago, my son was so happy and said hi from far away and tried to talk to his friend but she ignored us completely and dragged her daughter and walked away quickly.

I really want to confront her about this but my husband said that my son would lose his friend if I do. I do want them to go on play dates again when the rates go down since both me and my husband are vaccinated. My neighbors refuse to get vaccinated which I have nothing against. Your body, your choice. But I will be more careful around people who are not vaccinated. 

So my question is.... confront her? Or not?"

Which I like, because he knows its bedtime when he gets the paci and its an easy bedtime routine for us.  


But I feel like I may be creating a bad habit and that he will forever rely on it to go to sleep. Should I just stop giving it to him for naps and at night cold turkey? Any advise is much appreciated!"
Guyserbun007,2021-04-15 19:21:34+00:00,Should I stop my 3-year from playing in the park due to exclusion from her peers?,"My kid is 3 year old, and she is doing well at preschool. Teachers also said she interacts well with other kids there. However, since she is one of the youngest and smallest, after school, when we brought her to the park nearby, she really wants to play with and be part of her peer's group, but because of her size, younger age, and she doesn't talk a lot, other kids tend to exclude her (i.e., push her away, ignore her, or running away from her as a group), and I think this is quite traumatic to her and causing her to feel socially-excluded as she is very in-tuned and sensitive. I think it may be better for her to stop going to that park until my daughter is a bit bigger and more talkative. Is it the right move? If not, any suggestions?"

Because of his rolling we can’t use the swaddle bag anymore but now he has a problem with his newly discovered hands. He has absolutely no control of them. He has them always in his face or mouth so he can’t fall asleep or wakes himself up really often. Because of this he is crying for hours until we pick him up ( falls asleep being held because his arms are secured in a comfortable way).

Audreythe2nd,2021-04-15 18:58:14+00:00,"I'm having trouble distinguishing ""normal"" four year old behaviour during a pandemic","Is anyone else having this problem? My four year old started getting defiant and coupling that defiance with tantrums around the time of his birthday, and this also coincided with some further restrictions in our province, not getting to see his cousins, grandmother anymore, etc. The worst of his meltdowns seem to center around being disappointed at not getting to do something fun, or having to leave a place where he is having fun. Even as I type that out it *sounds* normal in theory, and especially during this stupid time period where nearly everything has been taken away from kids. And developmentally I know four year olds are infamous for challenging authority. It's just tough to manage his feelings with the age and his actions sometimes (my husband has had to carry him kicking and screaming from a park pretty recently, and that didn't start happening until he turned 4). My husband is a family doctor and has mentioned for us to keep an eye on it if it doesn't decrease by age 4.5... but that seems kind of arbitrary to me considering everything going on around us. He doesn't go to school at all yet (he was pulled from part time daycare last year and his been home with me and his 1 year old brother for over a year now), so maybe the bigger tell will be his behaviour when he gets there? 

Is anyone else confused by their own kid like this? I want to give him what he needs to cope, but I also don't know if I have the proper perspective on what's normal for a four year old boy. Any thoughts or anecdotes? Are your ""typically normal"" children angrier, melting down more often, experimenting with defying your authority, etc.? This sounds like such a basic question, but I'd really like to have a conversation about it to get some perspective here."

I blame myself for most of it because when me and her mom separated when she was 5 and when I had her I chose easy food over nutrition. Now she is 7 and if she’s not eating McDonald’s chicken Nuggets, bread, noodles with no sauce, or cheese pizza. Since I’ve been with my fiancé now going on 2 years we have attempted multiple times to get her to try new food. It’s difficult to try and keep her on a routine when I only have her Wednesday through saturday before she goes back to her BM. Her BM tells me she tries to get her to eat other food or at least try but I am not sure if she is telling the truth. 

My attempts lately have been telling her what we are having for dinner that night and she can either eat it or go without the entire night. She will constantly choose to not eat. So far my menu has been sloppy joes, hot dogs, pot roast, and tacos. Any tips or help would be appreciated. I do not want my daughter to be unhealthy and only eat fried food or cheese pizza.

He never wants to leave! We see my husbands mom, step dad, and grandma a lot less since they live further away. Our son loves when they come over but I don’t think he fully grasps that they are his grandparents. As for my husbands bio dad, he has never even met our son and has never asked to. I honestly forget that he has another grandparent. We haven’t even bothered to tell him about his other grandparent because there doesn’t seem to be a point.

My son though only seemed concerned about the consequences of his actions: possible time out, taking away toys, tablet. He didn't seem one bit concerned about the baby's well being.

myblasphemouslife,2021-04-15 17:30:30+00:00,Sharing my pain with my husband doesn't seem to register with him sometimes,"31f + 40m

It sometimes feels like he is not capable of comprehending the situation from my place. Or understand the pain I feel when something opens that door or how to respond.

I have 1 son (special needs 10yrs old full custody) from a former marriage. He has no children at all. We agreed due to too many reasons to list (it boils form to a responsibility matter mostly regarding my current son) we won't have a child and it'll be just us 3. We are comfortable balanced and happy as it is. 

Im on the copper iud and my period is late. I took a test and it was negative. I cried. I deeply want a 2nd child but I've accepted it's simply not the right or responsible decision for our family and I need to move on. I'm pretty good at compartmentalizing and this doesn't bother me most of the time but things like this force that door open and it hurts. 

If I accidentally became pregnant I would be thrilled and I know we both would want to keep it. But the intentional decision to have a child with the knowledge I have of all the factors is not a decision I want to make and have the lifelong resulting anxiety and guilt of ""I/we made this decision so it's my/our fault this is happening"" anytime negative things pertaining to having a 2nd child come up (which is a guarantee). I don't have that problem with my son now because he was not planned. He just happened. He also happened back when I didn't believe in abortion. 

Anyway. My husband doesn't seem to understand how to support me in this pain. There's no actual connection. I tell him but it's like there's nothing there but ""im sorry"" and ""it makes me so sad that this hurts you"". I know he's honestly trying. But there's nothing that can make him truly relate to my situation from my place. He has no children of his own. The monumental cognitive shift that happens after you have children just can't be artificially created. 

If anyone here can relate to any of this id love to hear from you if you care to share your experiences. Please no judgment. It's been a rough day."

TheWhiskeySour,2021-04-15 17:18:04+00:00,Am I expecting too much from my almost 5 year old? Or am I just on overload?,"As the title states, I'm trying to figure out if I'm expecting too much, if he's behaving ""badly"" or if I'm just on overload and losing it over the little things. 

A bit of background-
We stopped going to preschool in March 2020 because of COVID. That meant that I couldn't work anymore since he wasn't at school, so I'm a stay at home mom. Which honestly I usually love. But the last few weeks I've been walking a very fine line of keeping my temper and trying to not go crazy. I've been battling major depressive disorder for practically my entire life, and it's well managed, but I do realize when it rears its ugly head, and have been hyper aware of it and working with my doctor on med changes. I do as much as I can for self care, but there are never enough hours in the day to get what I actually need, despite a helpful spouse and my best friend who has been my quarantine buddy for the last year taking my son when I just can't anymore.  

The issue-
No matter what I ask, it takes 10 times as long as necessary for him to do whatever it is that I ask him to do. Put on socks? It takes 10 minutes, typically including a few minutes to decide on socks, then wondering around the house looking at things, then pretending to not know how to put them on, or letting the dog steal them on purpose and using that as an excuse to chase him around the house, until FINALLY, usually after threatening to take away some privilege, he'll get the socks on. Copy and paste for any other task. Getting dressed, going to the bathroom, eating dinner, etc. You get the idea. He refuses to do anything on his own unless it's in front of a screen, and we already watch so much more TV than we should, it's kind of ridiculous. He's an only child, but so am I, and I know that at his age I was playing for hours by myself with very little need for my parents to engage and play with me. 

I feel like he's very willfully ignoring me and pushing my buttons on purpose, but I can't decide if it's just regular 5 year old behavior, me being way too on edge and irritable, or him actually acting out in a way that needs to be dealt with from a disciplinary perspective. As I write this he's throwing coins around on his train table, nearly broke the piggy bank, and is now whining that I told him he needs to put them back in and that ""putting them one by one will take FOOOOORRRRREEEEEVVVVVERRRRRRRR"" while not actually trying to get them back in. 

I don't know what I expect from this post. I think chances are that I'm over reacting and he's just being a typical kid, but I'm on my last nerve and honestly am questioning everything about my parenting at the moment.

Thanks for reading."

Googila,2021-04-15 16:49:13+00:00,Video games,"Looking for advice. I can’t decide if I should be concerned or shouldn’t worry much about it. 

Son is 12 years old. Our jurisdiction has been in and out of lockdown since November, so seeing friends after school is technically illegal. He’s seen his friends a couple times when COVID case numbers were lower, but they’re much higher now, so it’s not happening. To make matters worse, he has spent probably half of the last calendar year out of school due to closures and is now on spring break and will be attending school virtually starting next week. 

During non-school hours, he spends most of his time playing video games - I’m talking like most hours of the day. He’ll stop to eat, and once approached to do chores, outdoor activity, and family time, he will quickly put his games away without any trouble, but left to his own devices, he would probably game all day. This is because he plays with all of his school friends.  They play in teams together so it allows him to connect with them. I don’t love the idea of video games to this level, but it’s the primary way he can connect and bond with his friends.

Should I be limiting this?  Just curious on everyone’s thoughts."

enlightenedkitty,2021-04-15 16:26:45+00:00,Daughters narcissistic bff.,"Few years ago my daughter made friends with this girl at school and things were going great till i started to get a lot of phone calls from their mutual teacher complaining about my daughters behaviour with her friend. He told me the girl my daughter had made friends with was trouble and was having a hard time at home ( her parents split there was a step parent that went to jail and she was constantly acting up at school).
She was a mean bully girl that if you werent with her you were against her and my daughter felt safer being in her circle then out of it which would make her a target for her friends bully behaviour. 
I had phone calls once a week sometimes twice. For months while teachers and myself tried to deal with this. 
Her bio mom didnt even live in town her dad had custody of her. 

Now flash forward her mother a year into their friendship moved back into town and her parents now had shared custody. The mother whos ex is in jail (i dont know why) married a new guy and has been trying to be a perfect wife mother online on Facebook. In my opinion shes very fake.

Her mother and i have never discussed their school issues ive tried bringing it up but she glosses over and whenever the girls have a falling out she tries to get involved and her and i have discussions on what we both want to see from our girls so they can be friends and not have conflict. But its hard to explain to my daughter that her friend is very narcissistic and thats why they are butting heads. 

When her friend comes over she is very stuck on outward appearances and talks about how perfect her life is at her moms house with their green smoothies and kale salads and everything is very mean girls time personality. Not educated talks at all. 

My daughter saw her asking for sympathy online and she told her that it would make her a target for bullies for putting herself out there all vulnerable and her friend took offence and now they are not talking.  

I dont know how many times ive told my daughter how bad this girls mind can be for her and for her not to follow suit because thats very toxic. I cant control my kids but i can guide them and tell them that beauty is on the inside and that all you have is your character at the end of the day. 

My daughter of course is upset that years of friendship and having to see her around but not be friends is hurtful. I dont know what else to do or say to her to help her feel better about this."
Trepidatious681,2021-04-15 16:24:16+00:00,Explaining to a toddler (2.5) that mommy is having surgery? Books about parents having it?,"I'm having laparoscopic abdominal surgery at the end of this month and I want to discuss it with my toddler but am unsure of how.

It's not for a serious condition so it's not like I'm sick, it's more preventative. Since it's laparoscopic it is a day surgery, I will have it while she's at daycare and will be back before she gets back. But I will be out of commission for awhile. I will basically be bed-ridden for 3 days minimum, then exhausted for another 3 days. After that I will be able to do things at a gradually increasing level, but I won't be able to pick her up for 4-6 weeks.

I'm a very active mom and am unsure of how to prepare her that I won't be doing much of anything for days and much less for weeks. I looked for books about surgery for toddlers but only found them about kids having surgery, not about mommy. If books aren't an option I would also just like advice about how to explain it to her without scaring her.

Thanks!"
KorryAnder,2021-04-15 16:17:08+00:00,Figured out why everybody was congratulating me.,"Over the last week I've been receiving a lot of smiles and congratulations. Mostly when I was passing by other parents at our daycare. It was strange, it was nobodies birthday, nothing special. I just let it slide.

Until I spoke to the daycare worker today and she told me she was so happy for us. I asked her why and she looked shocked. She told me our daughter had been talking about her little sister in mommies belly. Our daughter told everybody who wanted to hear she was going to be a big sister.

Problem is: I'm not pregnant. 
When I asked our daughter about it she said: ""yes you are mommy, look at your big belly."" I always thought I had a pretty normal belly, but thanks love.

She went to my in laws this week so I guess I have to make a call now."
yalogin,2021-04-15 16:14:58+00:00,How do you teach kids to persevere and not to procrastinate?,I see these two traits as really important and they are kind of related too. Did you have to think about them in the context of your kids? If so any techniques you used that worked or didn't work?
mrsfiction,2021-04-15 15:58:18+00:00,Advice for tough conversation: we eat animals,"So, my daughter is almost 2. And she loves animals. At her grandparents’ house she has nine pet chickens. She loves them and plays with them and feeds them. 

While we don’t eat meat at every meal, we are not vegetarians, and we do eat more chicken than anything else. The thing is, my daughter is quick and now that she’s familiar with chickens the living creatures, I’ve stopped using the term chicken to refer to food. We say meat or tenderloins or thighs. I’m just not ready for her to make that connection and have that conversation. I think in part because it was really hard for me to come around to that as a kid. 

I want my kid to have a healthy relationship with food and with animals. I don’t want her to be scared of accidentally eating a pet (again, that one’s on me). 

Am I overreacting to and overthinking this? Has anyone else needed to talk to their kids about this? Are there books I can read to wrap my head around the healthiest mindset for this?"
togepi77,2021-04-15 15:55:23+00:00,Adopting a 1 month old baby while having a 2 month old at home,"Would bringing a new baby into our home be the same as raising twins? Or would the month difference make it impossible to have them on the same schedule? 

My sister relapsed and is not taking care of her baby. CPS is not helping but she’s on probation and it’s just a matter of time before they take the baby from her. I’m terrified of the thought of raising two newborns, but I can’t let this baby go into the system. I have no family help so I don’t even know if it’s possible to raise two newborns at once :("
TKCVVI,2021-04-15 15:35:30+00:00,Tree House interior ideas - 9yr old doesn't use,"We bought a house a few years ago when my daughter was 6. It came with a tree house that we thought she'd be over the moon with. Turns out, 3 years in, it never gets used unless other kids are over and even then, nothing really now. 

Has the moment passed at 9.5 is too old, or is there anything I can do on the inside to make it something she would want to use? Mold is my bigger concern but I guess not so much in the summer."

We are literally taking turns being on duty every night whenever he drops it out his mouth (which is every minute) and his sleep is getting worse and worse of course because he’s Interuppted. Another thing is now in the daytime he wants to be held the entire time AND have the pacifier in his mouth. What do I do please help a FTM out"
glitterandnightmares,2021-04-15 15:16:27+00:00,I’m sorry idk where else to post this. Baby crying all day,"Hey! I’ve been babysitting a baby boy since he was about 4 months. I’m babysitting for a family friend who is struggling right now, and not being paid at all a fair rate but I’m helping out for a bit longer till I find something new. Anyways, the baby seems to just cry and scream all day for me now. I put him in his jumper, screams. Crib, screams. Play mat, screams. Swing, screams. I’m not a mother and this is my first babysitting experience so I get very overwhelmed. What could be causing this? I cannot hold him all day as I sometimes here for up to 9 hours at a time and I just can’t lol. But all he does is scream at the top of his lungs like it’s the end of the world when I put him somewhere what can I do or what could be the issue? I’m miserable :("
Mommah0814,2021-04-15 15:15:02+00:00,18mo son has hair issues,"I have long hair and it’s the most comforting thing in the world to my son. He can’t fall asleep without it. If I put it up, he freaks out and pulls it down until he can get a handful. I’m getting ready to go back to work for the first time since I had him and he’s never been to daycare or even spent a night away from me (my ex is no help). He has TERRIBLE separation anxiety issues and his pediatrician told me to find a toy with hair that he can take with him, but he hates everything! Does anyone have any advice? I’ve thought about just cutting it off, but in the last couple of months, my soon-to-be-ex-husband left us, and I’ve had to wean him, and have him start spending days away from me on the weekend with his dad- which he hates. My kids have all been reeling from all the changes and I don’t want to make things worse. I’ve also considered cutting my hair and keeping a bunch and making like, a tassel or something out of it for him to have? Idk. Probably sounds weird, but I’m up for any advice!"
oberynmviper,2021-04-15 15:04:32+00:00,"Real angry kid at home, am I the only one?","My daughter is almost five and while I heard kids at this age can be monsters, I need to double check if our experience is “typical” or I need professional help. 

My daughter is excellent at school. She behaves and listens and is very playful with her classmates. At home is another story, she still throws intense tantrums often and it can take her an hour to calm down. Worse thing is that sometimes we don’t know what triggers her. 

For example we gave her syrup over whipped cream on pancakes. Instant meltdown. She didn’t get a few more minutes in the iPad. Instant meltdown. 

This morning she woke up came to our room the. Went back to her own room to have a meltdown. We didn’t even know what happen. 

We’ve try to let her cool down and come back to talk, and we to make sure we let her know mom and dad are near when she is ready so we are no in her face tying to “solve” the situation. 

All that is okay but it’s come to the point where thing trigger almost everyday at least twice a day. Sometimes it’s for ridiculous reasons as I mention, but this gets real challenging when we want to enforce discipline. “No you can’t have that” or “it’s not time for this” get met with a full on blow out. It adds much, much stress and complication to an already hectic life. 

We are late for school or bedtime drags until 9:00 or 9:30 when it should be 8:00 or sooner. 

I am unsure of what to do now. It’s like my kid is out of control at home but is perfectly fine following rules and being calm at school."

Lavenderpicture,2021-04-15 14:34:21+00:00,The tween just will not do as requested,"I have a brilliant and strong tween girl, she is 10, this is still primary school  in our country. We are in lockdown for 2 weeks already and it will last at least a month more. She is a happy young girl, she play outside with other children in parks (this is allowed), play guitar and attend acrobatics. 
The daughter just refuses doing what she is requested. For 2 weeks. Starting from making her bed (I am Ok to ignore this), to her online lessons (she enters online meetings and just keep doing her staff in front of camera), tooth brushing, cleaning the table after her lunch, etc. She just answers “I will not do this”. That’s all. Calmly, thousand of times. She refuses to talk about this, only about smth else. 
We already have problems with school (I put “we” as school is attacking me as I am not able to engage her in lessons and homework).
I am puzzled. What should I do???"
greenbeans64,2021-04-15 14:12:17+00:00,Rules for post-covid vax visits with grandparents: Am I crazy?,"My in-laws are now fully vaccinated against covid and will be visiting us and our 2-year-old daughter soon. My husband and I will be partially vaccinated at the time of their visit, but obviously our daughter will not be. I have a very low risk tolerance and feel like we just don't know enough yet about long-term effects of covid (including in children) and the extent to which it can spread through vaccinated people. With that in mind, I would like for their visit to take place outdoors with masks if close together, but no masks is fine if further apart. In the future when covid cases are much lower in the community or we learn more about the risks, I'd be willing to take fewer precautions. Until then, are my requests to stay outdoors and wear masks when close crazy? Am I being unreasonable?"
deadlypantstx,2021-04-15 14:08:19+00:00,Children have 0 respect for ex-wife,"I’ll try and keep this short and as objective as possible. 

My 3 young boys do not care and have zero respect for their mother. Also in turn she has zero control over them. They laugh at her when she asks them to do things, they tell her things like “daddy’s is charge of you”. I do not have these problems in my house hold. They have the upmost respect for their step mother as well. They do not have behavior problems at school and are very receptive to their tournament baseball coaches. 

I do my best to never turn them against their mother, I always try and support her parenting style at her house. I am constantly getting phone calls to calm my 8 year old down or I am having to literally scold them over the phone or face time (which I feel is not fair to me). 

It’s been this way for a long time, she’s getting married to her boyfriend, fiance, then ex fiancé, and ex/new fiancé (all same guy). She has insisted on him being an authority at her house, yet the boys have zero trust or respect for him. 

I do not know how to navigate this any further. I’ve told her she needs to seek some counseling on how to get control of her house. Looking for advice."
idkmanijdk,2021-04-15 13:34:01+00:00,Is it normal for a baby to sound like a wild animal?,"Our son is almost 8 months old. He was a premie so we track him at his adjusted age which is 6~ months. He was born early, but he’s suffered no side effects and is doing perfectly according to the docs. He just needed time to gain weight in the NICU!

Anyway, instead of crying when he wakes up he’s started to screech, yell, and make very funny noises. He sounds like a little monkey sometimes! He will even do this when he’s standing in his little play jumper thing or whenever he gets really amped up. It’s honestly hilarious, but is this how all babies are? I’ve never really been around another baby so I have no idea. Lol. Next doctors appointment isn’t for a month or two so I haven’t had a chance to let him demonstrate for her."

I know he does now mean it maliciously, but I don’t know what to do. One example was last Friday, I was packing up our last things as we were going out of town. I left son in the master bedroom with my husband so he could keep an eye on him. I come back in from loading the car and my husband is walking around the house doing a few things but doesn’t have the baby. So I asked where the baby was and he said he left him in the bedroom. I walked back there to find him playing with a cup of ant poison that was in our bathroom. I picked him up and walked up to my husband and told him what happened. He didn’t say anything and just kept doing this or that around the house. 

I am with my son all day every day just about and now I feel like I can’t even leave him to be alone with his own dad. I am at a loss of what to do. Please help."

I still can't get it out of my head though that this Blippi guy is for starters, just super weird, but also in 2013 he posted a Harlem Shake video where he pooped on his naked friend's butt. Lol, the internet is constantly scoured to make sure this video is absolutely nowhere, and it's not, but it totally happened. So I find it ironic that he sells underwear now. xD"
