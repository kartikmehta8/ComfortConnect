This is how we create better relationships. This is how we allow things to happen and not always try to control them. This is how we can let go of the traumas and negativity of the past. This is how we can live a truly fulfilling life."

I am taking part in a meditation fundraising challenge and I wondered whether some of you would be interested in supporting.

For my challenge I aim to meditate for 100 minutes, every day, for 10 days. My challenge will begin on Sunday 2 May and run through to Tuesday 11 May. 

I am doing this to raise money for the NSPCC. The NSPCC is the only charity fighting to end child abuse in the UK and Channel Islands. I am hoping to raise vital funds so that the NSPCC can continue to protect children at risk and help children who’ve been abused to rebuild their lives.  

I am sure some of you frequently meditate for more than 100 minutes a day, but for me this will definitely be a challenge! Nonetheless I'm determined to give it my best, even if my mind gets distracted a lot!

Any money you can spare will help the NSPCC to be there for every child.

cvntcvntcvnt,2021-04-30 17:23:01+00:00,The Beginning of a Breakthrough? Any Advice Appreciated,"**TL;DR**: Feel a separation between myself and experience that was always there. Finally got to the bottom of it (?) but still a long way to go. Any pointers or advice that you guys have? Any similar experience?

I will try to be as concise as I can.

Recently, there's been a little bit of frustration while meditating. The issue that I've been having again and again is noticing that I was lost in thought, then focusing on the in-breath, but then when the out-breath happens, I immediately plunge back into think think think.

Also, as I've been meditating, I've noticed that there always felt like this separation between me and what I was focusing on. Interestingly, the separation or wall is there the most with breathing and physical sensations (including the breath). It's kind of there for sight, and it's the least there for sound.

Anyways, by separation I mean that I'm noticing the breath, but not \*really\* noticing. My attention isn't fully there, and my mind is going and going and going in the background so I can't concentrate. My attention from my mind is never released.

Today while meditating, I had two ideas. First: ""Wait a second! Is this how I've been my entire life?!"" Second: ""I have to observe this separation.""

And that's what I did. I observed this wall that I have between me and experience, I was noticing the think think think of my mind. And I feel like something opened up afterwards. It's like I was looking at my experience of life for the first time ever. That ""opening"" happened rather late in the meditation session, so I didn't get a good look.

Am I onto something here? Does anyone have a comparable experience? Would love to hear any anecdotes or advice.

Thanks, love you all."

evervenescence,2021-04-30 15:59:24+00:00,Am i the only one? Neurotically trying to conceptualise existence making me depressed.,"hey folks,

ever since i can remember, like even as quite a little child, from time to time i had these thoughts about our existence and where it leads to after all and when i let them take turns, it can take me to a seemingly endless mindfuck. At some point the string of thoughts ""stops"". But it feels more like i take a muffled down version of the resulting desperation into the rest of the day/week/life.

I also tend to feel pretty alone when i'm aware of this ""problem"", like everyone taking their life experience so serious and making the most out of it being obsessed with their current jobs and partners etc. and i just can't seem to do so while this question is still bothering me.

So it is that my mind can't comprehend the concept of death or sudden non-existence, which is kind of normal i guess by itself. But then i jump right to endless existence, which is something i believe more in but it also frightens me way more? Dunno, just that i am existing now, without being able to ""remember"" anything that would have been before. And after death? Does this cycle just go on like this for litterally ever? I mean something tells me there can't be any end to it and this really frightens me. Like really visualising this in my mind and making this thought come alive in all depth of it. That i/we are already here as consciousness and i can't really decide what happens to/with me...

Dunno maybe i should just get a job finally and trying to take this life experience for all that i have like seemingly everybody around me does. I feel like this is the magic key to not having this endless ""deep"" streams of thought....but then i just seem to be obsessed with philosophising endlessly about what could be (also what could have been) although i see it doesn't take me anywhere good...and this seems to hinder me of taking small steps in building my current life experience and taking shit serious.

hope you're all well!"
JMCochransmind,2021-04-30 15:56:37+00:00,Being Sober is Beautiful.," I was an addict for more years of my life than I was sober. I used opiates to deal with the mental pain of life. I'm not going to write a sob story, but my life growing up wasn't sunshine and roses as I'm sure is the same for most people who are addicted. I was getting so far gone and pushing the pain I had gone through in life so far down and not dealing with it, that it was rotting inside of me. It was starting to make me legitimately crazy. I cared some, but not much, and not enough to get off drugs. I had tried before just to stop, but I didn't realize how much work was going to be involved, what I was in for, or where to begin. It took me three years of trying different methods like methadone, rehab, suboxone, meditation and therapy to finally get to the starting line of what I thought was the path to sobriety.

While going through all of this it was like I was marching up a snowy mountain with a backpack on. I was tightly holding my shoulder straps, trudging through the snow uphill one step at a time. After a couple of months I would lift my head up to see I was still in the exact same place. So again, I put my head down and trudged on. For over a year it seemed like I was in the same place every time I looked up. I had learned a lot though while walking. I truly learned the meaning of patience and calmness and finally understood this is a marathon not a sprint. I learned that hope was the only thing I had in the most desperate times when I felt like just giving up and setting down in the snow, not to care anymore. In the mind of my mind, I was climbing a ladder or the steps of a pyramid. Every lesson was like an ascension of knowing who I was and what I had to do. Like going through the chakras to start at red over and over again, growing the whole time.

One day things changed a little as I felt some tension release. I didn't realize I was over the crest, just knew it was starting to get easier and I felt myself descending down the other side. Still learning in the mind of my mind lessons to take with me. I learned it is okay to just be okay with yourself. That being ashamed and the fear and anxiety that came along with it weren't going to help me on my travels, so I had to shed that baggage to get where I wanted to be. People don't look at you and see what you think of yourself. They just see what is in front of them at that moment. So, if you're doing better, that is the picture you project. They don't know the challenges you're facing in your mind and body to just make it through the day. So again, my head down I keep trudging through the snow down the side of the mountain.

One day I felt something completely different. I had accepted the snow and the mountain and without knowing where I was, I look up and there isn't any snow. I'm coming into a valley with a beautiful meadow, and I can shed some of my baggage knowing I'm in a better place. I still have my journey ahead but I'm feeling better about each step, still learning in the mind of my mind. I have this energy inside of me that wants to persevere. I want to be a good person and give off a good energy for others to realize anything is possible.

Feeling light and free I walk to the edge of the meadow with my shoulders tall and straight from everything I've carried and learned to cope with. The mind of my mind gave way to me being myself and knowing who I was. I felt whole once more. As I make my way through the trees there is a beautiful little stream. I wash myself and stand up a clean person, free and ready to face the world as I had never known before. As I look around with my eyes clear, in that moment I realize, this is beautiful!"

astillmind23,2021-04-30 14:29:15+00:00,What I’ve learned after 13 years practice and 5 years teaching,"If you’re not practicing to surrender, you’re not going to advance. The mind does not go where the real meditation is, you must drop it through surrender. Then you start to experience what meditation is. 

Very unpopular truth... most don’t understand what meditation is. The same way that Jane Fonda was leading the ‘exercise’ trend in the 80s, mindfulness apps and similar practices are today. We’re only scratching the surface. 

True yoga is the key to uncovering your own unique gifts and abilities to ensure you can live your most fulfilled life. 

I honestly don’t know how to properly convey this but I’ll keep working on sharing it with as many people as possible in my life. To realise it is to upgrade your life in ways only previously imagined."

EmotionalAd7741,2021-04-30 12:31:04+00:00,Taking a break from meditation.,"I started meditation roughly a year ago from now, switching through various types of meditation every now and then.

I still have anxiety, negative thoughts, frustration, etc. In fact recently all of those negative feeling seemed to amplify 5x, it’s like I’m in this loop.

I want to see what happens to my mental state if I take a break from meditation for a couple weeks or so to see if it is truly helping me."
fxthea,2021-04-30 12:21:11+00:00,The value of returning to the breath,"Wanted to share a recent insight I had that maybe will help someone else see the value and even benefit of having distractions SO THAT we can practice return to the breath. 

While sitting thoughts arise and we treat each thought like a ball we have to hold. And if we stop holding it in attention it’ll drop — which is true. 

Some thoughts were not that attached to, were not clinging to. We see these thoughts as rubber balls and we feel fine dropping them. It doesn’t feel that wrong to drop them. 

Then there are thoughts that are maybe more emotionally charged — thinking about a future event, planning for that event, remembering a past event, wondering why we did what we did — these thoughts feel more valuable and we see it as a glass ball. That if we drop it there’s a lot we lose. And at first when we drop these thoughts it does feel like you’re dropping and shattering a glass ball. 

So by returning to the breath even when there’s a strong pull to the thought is the practice of dropping more and more glass balls until we don’t mind dropping glass balls. 

Do this enough and we see that there is no thought that’s more valuable than another. 

Hopefully that helped!"

It’s making me feel more and more that doing anything other than just accepting what is, is the minds attempt to stay in control. Even meditation is just the separate self attempting me do so something that it’ll never be able to do.

It’s a hard pill to swallow, and honestly mixing me up more than making things clearer. I can’t work out if this is a road block or an insight.

m_chutch,2021-04-30 07:31:30+00:00,How do I find a spiritual mentor?,"I have been following a path of spirituality that began when I was 16 or so, with the ever-increasing awareness of the absurdity of human life. This was after I had realized that believing in God was directly in discordance with who I naturally was, a gay young man. My dad was my teacher of all things moral growing up, and while I disagree with his belief system now, I truly believe that he was acting out of an ultimate desire to love and discipline. 

I am graduating university this month. Over the last five years or so, I have been trying to find meaning. It became torturous at times, because despite reading existential and moral philosophy, researching Krishna, transcendental meditation, psychedelic drugs, Reading the Bhagavad Gita, meditating, etc., I was still not at peace. 

I feel like I am dedicated to the spiritual path, and I know that meditation is an access point for truth, real awareness. When I was meditating most was around 15 after reading the book 'Power of Now.'

During the weeks that followed reading that book, I felt that I was truly free. I was consistently choosing to be aware of what I was seeing and feeling, and not letting my thoughts take over. 

Somehow or another, I have gotten so deeply caught up in my life and my ego and my crisis of identity, that I slipped back into a constant state of trying to distract myself from silence, and from having to feel what it is like to be me. 

I'm hoping to find a spiritual teacher. I'm not sure if this is the right place to look, so if not my apologies. I would hope to talk with someone who is not particularly affiliated with a major religion.

thank you"

I have been meditating on and off for half a year, and in the periods where i meditate frequently, I've seen benefits such as controlling of urges and being more present.

I want to start meditating longer and daily, however, there is one thing I'm concerned about and would love some new perspective on. I tend to overthink, so keep that in mind.

I am a very creative person and a lot of my ideas comes to me when I am daydreaming and my mind is *wandering*. Because mindfulness and meditation discourages the endless wandering mind, I am concerned that I might miss out on some epiphanies or ideas while being more present.

I have been a longtime lurker of this sub and I've never read anything negative about meditation, it's always ""meditation saved my life"". If meditation gives you SO much, what does it take away?

In the Post someone shared the experience of doing deep breathing exercises before meditating. He or she said that deep breathing enhanced his or her meditation dramaticaly. I couldnt find the post so here is my review.

 Over the last couple of days I had exactly the same experience. Normally I do 5min to max. 14min(my previous record) meditation during the day and before sleeping a guided bodyscan meditation. After doing the the deep breathing exercises I was able to meditate for 30min+ without a problem during the day, which is double of the max. time I was able to do before. I also believe it enhanced the effects of the meditation but that could be the fact that I meditated longer. 

Im very surprised by the positive effects it had in that short amount of time and I will definitly practice it daily right before I do my meditation during the day."

Hamiltonian5667,2021-04-29 23:56:12+00:00,"If you're having trouble maintaining awareness, try walking meditations.","I've been meditating for about 30 minutes to an hour daily for the past few months, but I've found that the typical 'sit down with your eyes closed' meditations particularly challenging because my mind is usually exhausted, and so I tend to almost drift off into sleep, suddenly regain my awareness, and then start drifting off again. 

As an alternative, I've started walking meditations every other day which keep me alert and interested enough such that maintaining awareness is much easier. Walking meditations also have the added benefit of being able to maintain focus on the ever-changing world around you, and losing the 'self' in the sense of becoming fully immersed in the events outside the body. There are also techniques you can try, like imagining the world as a work of art, which cultivates a sense of wonder and appreciation in the mundane. I'm also starting to find that walking meditation cultivates a better understanding of the connection between the world and the mind. You start to see the relationship between the events going on around you and the way your mind responds/reacts to them. 

The downside of walking meditations is that you obviously still have to think about walking and maintain a certain level of vigilance (don't get hit by a car or a bike!), which prevents entering a deep state of silence and complete loss of ego. That's why I still do the 'eyes closed sit down' meditation every other day.

Anyways, just thought I'd share because this is something I've found useful. I'd be curious to hear if anyone else practices walking meditation or a balance between walking and silent (eyes closed) meditation."

some children told us that believing within the power of something outside of themselves can help to ease their symptoms.

Three days ago I started feeling that when I put my attention on some part of my body a knife or something else sharp is injuring me, creating a disgusting feeling and stopping me from relaxing myself. Basically, the knife thing keeps coming over and over ruining the meditation.

I tried three things with no results:

1 - I tried to note this thing and continue the meditation, but the knife feeling comes so fast that when I noted it, it's already too late, I already felt the knife injuring me with discomfort. I keep noting it but the idea keeps coming every time causing the same discomfort.

2 - I tried just to ignore the knife as fast as it comes, this way I don't feel the disgusting feeling at all, but this also keeps me from focusing on my body, because I'm just waiting to the knife idea to come and I cannot relax myself.

3 - I ended imaging that my body is surrounded by a thick armor, and nothing sharp can hurt me, but as before I have to keep thinking that I'm surrounded by an armor and I cannot focus on my body.

soviedo20,2021-04-29 16:04:19+00:00,Attitudes and approach to self-observation and meditation. My personal note,"  

Hello everyone! This is my first post about meditation and my first post on Reddit. I've been practicing meditation (different types, and schools) on and off for 7 years and would like to leave you some personal feedback:  


I would like to make a personal observation about the **attitude stance** towards the thoughts we have. *In my experience* with meditation, thoughts are only a problem if they present a problem for us: if we believe what they say and that generates some kind of rejection. Otherwise thoughts are a natural element of the mind: Not that we are our thoughts or that all thought is useful. While one can indeed have the experience of not having thoughts or not focusing on them, this state is not always attainable, nor is it the most useful of all.

Just consider this: if we didn't really have any kind of emotional charge, or rejection of the content of thoughts then it wouldn't be a problem, it's only a problem because we have a rejection of the content, or what they represent: not that we can always ""have control over their elaboration"", they arise in consciousness along with self-identification, and ""we can't do much"" about it, it's a quite natural process.

If we think of thoughts as categorical and see their 'self-limitation' I think we can understand which ones may be more useful than others. By this I mean, if we take the attitude of: All thought is 'useless' in terms of: 'we are not the thoughts, let it all go' we have to think about how it affects the new generation of thoughts that arise because of this, given their self-reflective nature.

But if we approach meditation with a much more loving, patient, and really non-judgmental self-image of ourselves (less aggressive, less dramatic) and take time to accept that whatever content is going to come up is part of the process of getting better, and that we don't want to be that. I mean, actually having that ""background"" image of ourselves is much more effective than taking the attitude of ""losing all identity"" with thoughts. Because the thoughts are going to come anyway, mostly the ""more painful"" ones (which are self-identifying). Not that we can't have that experience of thoughts becoming less and less self-identifying. Even that is a good goal, but many are quick to jump to that place, but their mind is already ""problematic for themselves"". So it seems to me a perfectly valid concession to have a really much more positive attitude and it seems to me even crucial to prepare much more the set and setting of our mind and how we are going to face it than how we are going to transit or what might happen.

Again: if we didn't have problems with our thoughts per se, this natural issue of self-identification would not be a problem. But for many it is, so it is perfectly valid to have that approach. I would even say that if you have that conscious attitude as a background state of mind, of being aware of that negative self-talk and so self-critical of yourself, you will see how the subsequent process of meditation or even what you do during the day will meet less emotional resistance, at least in terms of anxiety, and depressive thoughts, and will be more peaceful. 

This is because thoughts are ""layered"" (to put it loosely and colloquially) and if we relate differently to the ""deeper"" thoughts the rest of the thoughts can arise without so much resistance: For example, if during the day we become more aware of the negative self-talk and the negative self-demands that we automatically place on ourselves and if we cultivate a truly loving and compassionate attitude towards ourselves, everything will have much less resistance, even when we start to have less and less of these ""problematic"" thoughts will be a mere anecdote for us because we know that we have a more positive attitude towards ourselves. I know that one also can take a different approach, more yogic if you like: ""we are not ANY content of our mind and we have to lose any kind of identification"". Not that I have a problem with this, but honestly, everyone's history of thinking is different and often ""getting to that state"" has a lot of difficulty, more emotional resistance and can generate a lot more load of new judgmental thoughts towards ourselves.

In my experience taking the approach of losing identity with every kind of thought or every kind of mental object of self-identification that arises is not as effective with the new thoughts that arise again. At least if I don't have that image in the background, or if I don't first consider the image I have of myself, an image of love, of compassion, of non-judgement. If we keep this in mind and are aware of the self-talk of the mind then we can take on the ability to peacefully observe the content of consciousness. And this can be like being more aware, more mindful, and taking that self-awareness as the ""object"" of focus.

No doubt many take the approach: ""But the self is an illusion and the best we can do is to lose any kind of identity with anything related to it"". I'm not saying it's a bad strategy, but in my experience having the attitude I mentioned above generates much less resistance in everything that arises than having the latter attitude.

PS: I know many would probably say: but that's because the ego likes not to lose its identity and so it feels more secure if it can keep control of its thoughts and they are happy, but it's an illusion and you have to fight with the ego or let the ego die.

For me the latter is optional, if one wants not to be dogmatic one might want to see and compare what works best in one's experience.

Anyway this is my experience and opinion, I hope it helps.

Greetings."

puteminnacoffin,2021-04-29 14:45:55+00:00,Meditating for fun,"Anyone else meditate just for fun sometimes? I started meditating about 7 years ago to combat my panic and self harm disorders, but after years of doing it and finding myself in some very fascinating head spaces, I often meditate just for fun. 

I don’t deal with the mental anguish that I used to deal with, so when I meditate I’m able to really sink into the moment for extended periods of time and have some spectacular experiences in my own head. For instance, last night I did 50 minutes with my eyes closed focusing on my breathing and occasionally centering my focus on one of my chakras. After about 30 minutes or so, When i shifted my focus and energy to my third eye in the center of my forehead, things started to get really weird. A bright, white light filled my field of vision and made my head feel really warm. 3d patterns and shapes came from nowhere and built off of each other, morphing and shifting into new ones. I lost feeling of my body and it felt like the only thing I was made of was my throat and lungs as the air traveled through them. Everything fades away. 

All of this stuff seemingly comes from something or somewhere else. Maybe it’s inside of me, maybe it’s outside of me, but these colors, spectacles, and feelings feel like they’re being channeled through me. It’s very fascinating and it puts me in the most relaxed and comfortable state. I feel like a sponge and I just want to just stay there forever sometimes. I also like to smoke a little weed sometimes and it makes these experiences more intense. 

Anyway, just felt like sharing with y’all. After years of using meditation to work through mental issues and the stresses of life, it’s fun to just use it as a tool to have some fun and explore my mind sometimes. Shit gets weird in there and it helps me connect with the wonder and fascination I experienced as a child. Let me know if y’all can relate. Much love, peace ❤️"
ChaoticSign,2021-04-29 14:44:27+00:00,Mindfulness of the Full Mind,"Consciousness, interacting through the subtle sense of physical awareness, may interact with the brain through this awareness.

This allows the brain to synchronise perfectly as one, which is why you then extend that awareness across your whole nervous system.

Truly feel your nervous system, keep in mind the function, and you will be utilising your entire nervous system correctly.

In this way, we can specifically focus on right-left brain communication by holding the focus of neurogenesis while visualising specific parts of the brain one at a time:

- The Pineal Gland
- The right brain
- The left brain
- The Frontal cortex (+left and right)
- The Amygdala

Allowing consciousness to reach these areas through the practice of your actual conscious awareness entering those places, so consciousness may have a bridge to begin experiencing the states of being these sides of the brain that (experientially) simulate your existence.

lookatmeicantype,2021-04-29 13:23:18+00:00,Can a beginner start with the meditation style taught by Sayadaw U Tejaniya?,"It has been a couple years since I've meditated tbh. 

Before that I was meditating for a couple years mainly using a noting vipassana technique similar to the technique Mahasi teaches. I say similar because I learned it from other sources.

I've decide I want to pick up a meditation practice again. It's been a while and I was going to possibly read a book from Mahasi and pickup where I left off with the technique I used in the past.

However, I stumbled upon a couple books recommended from Tejaniya and people describing his technique as a bit of a different take on an insight style of meditation. I was wondering if his style is appropriate for a beginner? I was also wondering if anyone could provide some advice or knowledge on it's different qualities or aims when compared to something like what Mahasi teaches?

I have been on and off meditation for the last decade. I have been consistent for months at a time usually and 2 years is my record at this point. Each time I go back to my same technique and one time I had tried a mantra based technique. I've found I have had the best experience personally with an insight noting technique usually with an anchor to my abdomen movement.

So personally I'd like to pickup again somewhere in that are, but this is my first time hearing about Tejaniya and what I'm hearing sounds interesting. It seems like it might be something that could perhaps click with me a little more than the noting technique I've done in the past if it's suitable for beginners. I wanted to get some other takes on this. Sorry for the long ramble but thanks for any advice or info."
Jax_Gatsby,2021-04-29 12:58:56+00:00,Don't buy into your thoughts.,"Throughout the day thoughts are always coming up, auditioning for your attention. For most of us, as soon as a thought pops up, we immediately identify with it; we buy into what it's selling us. And the instant we do that, we're immediately taken away from the peace that is always present *here* and *now.* I'm sure some of you have noticed how thoughts can easily snowball into dark places. This explains how someone can wake up happy but by the afternoon they already feel depressed, it's because they bought into their thoughts. 

Identifying with negative thoughts produces negative emotions and identifying with positive thoughts produces positive emotions. Reading that you might think that the goal should be to think positive and only identify with positive thoughts, but this isn't possible. Negative and positive thoughts are two sides of the same coin; you can't have one without the other. So the real solution is to stop identifying with thoughts altogether because we generally don't even decide what thoughts we have in the first place; our thoughts aren't even our own.

One of the best things I've learnt in my life is to not buy into my thoughts, to just watch them without engaging with them. Unfortunately the human mind has been conditioned for thousands of years to identify with thoughts so sometimes the mind identifies with thoughts without me even being aware of it, but another thing I've learnt is that mediation isn't about how long you can stay present but about how often you can bring your attention back to the present. Knowing this, I don't beat myself up when I catch the mind identifying with thoughts because that would just be more ego.

Realising all this made such an impact on me that it inspired me to write an album called ['Watching The Sky Fall'](https://open.spotify.com/album/3KyHX3SwPjbcAK2TOfzfVJ), which is essentially about the process of watching the mind and all it's craziness without identifying with it."

I can only compare it to the feeling of sea legs, or how your body moves after being at the theme park for the day. Sometimes it is uncontrollable &amp; would grow more intense as i thought about it..but I have recently began to harness the powers of my brain and stop it when it becomes overpowering.

So I was having a guided meditation session. At one point, the man guiding the meditation said to observe everything that passed through my mind:

“All this can be done below the level of thought”

Now this was powerful with me as it evoked the idea/opinion that thinking is a choice. There are a myriad of things going on in your head and noticing them is normal. When we instead find ourselves thinking, we have chosen to magnify the importance of one of these passing thoughts/observations. And just as we chose to think, we can chose to revert to the normal circumstances... where we merely notice and stay aware

Am i right here? I feel like it is nothing groundbreaking but i wonder whether it is too much of a stretch."

Itsme66604,2021-04-29 07:06:05+00:00,Is Qigong and singing bowl chakra balancing legit?,"I’ve been thinking of taking meditation more serious and have found a private retreat that has caught my interest. It is a week long private 1:1 retreat consisting of only student/mentor and not in a group so it’s individually tailored. A day usually consists of - Daily Qigong classes, awakening/coaching, Tibetan singing bowl chakra balancing/healing sessions, Daily prayer and meditation session, including Qigong meditations. 

Has anyone got experience with any of these to say if they truly work or not?  My intention is to get away from normal everyday life to a retreat for around a week later this summer so I can detox and recalibrate my body to take meditation more serious and for spiritual growth.  However because of many con artists in western spirituality circles I’m not sure if it’s legit or not."

Galeaf_13,2021-04-29 04:58:44+00:00,Is meditation a placebo?,"I heard there are a lot of benefits from meditation (reducing anger, anxiety, better focus, etc.). But my question is, do this benefits apply just from the fact that you meditate or by you remembering that you meditate, so, for instance, you shouldn't be angry in one situation or another?  

I have this question because I meditate in the evening and don't remember that on the next day at all. Does this mean meditation is worthless for me? (Though, I really doubt it's the case, it's always good to know any caveats)"
That-Passion8515,2021-04-29 04:33:45+00:00,Beginning,When you first start meditating meditate with a smile and don’t stop until you come to a realization. It could take a short time or a very long time.
CHAlN,2021-04-29 03:32:13+00:00,Meditation analogy I experienced with a bumblebee,"I was sitting on a park bench today with some friends after we went for a run, and there was a bumblebee that kept hanging around us by the bench. We all were aware that bumblebees won't harm us if it doesn't feel threatened, but we're still not really fond of a bee getting that close to us, to the point where one of my friends jumped off the bench to get away.

Even though my body's natural reaction was to get away, I was tired from my run and didn't want to stand lol. Instead, I closed my eyes and imagined there was no bee there, and nothing to worry about or be scared of from sitting on that bench. Lo and behold, the bee ended up just minding its own business near me, and all the thoughts I had of the bee flying up my shorts or stinging me were all in my mind.

It was such a simple everyday situation, but I feel like it helped me understand how powerful it can be to quiet all the negative and excess thoughts in your mind."
Libertine74,2021-04-29 02:50:50+00:00,May I breathe with my mouth open? It makes a big difference!,"For the past three months, I have dutifully breathed in and out exclusively through the nose. Today I used both my mouth and nose and the difference was noticeable.  I was able to relax my body, sink into my body with a much deeper and thorough exhale. The air was much more “tactile” hence easier to regard as an object of attention.  Is there a good reason to avoid breathing through the mouth. What say you?"
poka1123,2021-04-29 02:14:33+00:00,Focus on breathing,"I recently started meditating, 10 days as it now. I practice meditation by focusing on my breath. But for last 2 days, I was not able to concentrate on my breathing. I keep a count of my breaths. I was always losing the count and getting frustrated.

Today I drank water before meditation and then I was able to focus on breaths and did not forget the counts. After a while, I did not need the count as I was enjoying to observe my breathe in and breathe out.

I mostly just watch and count my breath; and practice anulom vilom and kapal bhati( Indian meditating techniques)

Please provide additional tips and suggest some good book to read.

Have a good day!"
emmb1998,2021-04-29 01:52:07+00:00,How do I accept myself at my lowest point and still change? Advice needed!,"I was talking to a friend and realised in order to change I need to accept myself, but that is such a strange paradox? I’m at my rock bottom, sure things could be worse, but I want things to get better quickly. I have no patience. i want to have a job, I want to be physically healthy &amp; be thin, but I just keep hitting roadblocks, and I know it’s because I can’t accept myself right now. How do I do that and still change myself? How do I find kindness and compassion and acceptance for who I am in this moment so that I can change myself? Will the “acceptance” make me complacent and not want to change what needs changing? 
I keep failing at keeping any promises to myself , and I know there is a pattern here that I can’t see can anyone help me see it? 
Thanks any input to make this better would be appreciated thank you"

dansys,2021-04-29 00:48:19+00:00,Does this count as meditation?,"I’ve downloaded all the apps basically saying I’m going use the guided meditations to meditate everyday and I’ve failed at at so many times. 

The one thing I’ve been successful at is when I wake up in the morning, I have a glass of water while sitting in silence in bed. After I write in my dream journal if necessary. If the tv or fan is on, I turn it off and I honor that time of peace. I refuse to think about work or start planning for the day, or I brush those thoughts away when they arise. 

I’m thinking if I get away from the idea of sitting crossed legged for 20 minutes I’ll be more successful at developing a practice that fits my personality more."

friskyfrog224,2021-04-29 00:09:39+00:00,Having No Head While Teaching,"Hello. I recently received my 7-12 English certification to teach and currently, I am filling in for a teacher on maternity leave. I want to describe a recurring experience - or perhaps mode of experience - that continues to happen.

While Teaching, discussing, engaging with my students, my mindfulness will kick in and I will , not even consciously , turn attention upon itself (shout-out Sam Harris 🤑) and will see very clearly that I have no head. (If I was not educated on meditation and the jargon to go along with it, I would probably call it  a flow state , or just really in the zone. )

 I talk with my students, hear their discussions, respond, and it doesn't feel like 'I' am doing anything. For me, while teaching, the Insight is quite clear and it feels great!

However , as you may know , it is a very vulnerable mode of being. It's a very unguarded way of being and I fear, sometimes, that ... I don't know ... That I shouldn't be so open in front of my students. Its hard to describe. It feels like I am going to fall down a well and I am afraid too, afraid of being so raw and vulnerable , while in front of so many people (who are watching my every move). I suppose the ego would like to hang around...

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone has similar experiences in their occupation or day to day life."

GIPPINSNIPPINS,2021-04-28 22:13:24+00:00,I’ve started meditating on my own (without a guided video or sound). What types of exercises should I do?,"I recently started meditating on my own for about 10 minutes before I go to school. I am a religious person and love to start my meditation with a prayer for the day then I focus on my breath. I focus on the inhale and exhale. Sometimes I do a short body scan, but I’m not sure I get the point of them. My question to this wonderful and wise community is what things do you do in your meditations? Do you have exercise examples?


Also I would really like to thank all the people who post on this sub. The posts I see are so well thought out and wise. When I hit upvote on some of the posts I feel like it’s not enough because of how positively the post effected me. I’m sorry if you would tell me that I could give them an award, but sadly I cannot because of money reasons. Again I can’t wait to see your posts and stay in the moment the best you can. This moment only comes once."
The-Adster,2021-04-28 21:51:47+00:00,I am brand new to meditation and want some guidance,"Hello all.

Firstly, my apologies if this post does not follow the rules/guidelines (I skimmed them); I'm brand new to both meditation and this subreddit.

As of late, school is only allowing me to fit two to three 15-minute breaks, as well as one 30-45-minute break in my busy 16-hour day. Instead of using that time to watch pointless videos for my pleasure, I figured I should do something meaningful with my time (i.e., meditation).

I quite literally have no idea what I'm doing. I would like to participate in meditation during my longer 30-45-minute. break (which is usually at \~12:30 pm), after my lunch break. I need some help getting started:

* Is there a best time to meditate at?
* How many times per day should I meditate?
* How long should I meditate for?
* Is there an iPhone app or website I can access on my laptop for guided meditation?

Any help is very much appreciated."

lucagee__,2021-04-28 21:50:13+00:00,Meditation courses stripped off of spiritualism,"Hello,
I've been doing meditation for a while now specifically for optimising performance, relax and increase the overall health of my brain.

Lately I've been liking guided meditation, but I often found courses to be filled with the spiritualistic stuff which annoy me at best.

Is there anywhere where I could practice daily guided meditation without its attachment to spiritualism?"

Just looking for some advice- I've done yoga a few times and have never really been able to fully get into it.

Agapee-,2021-04-28 20:46:17+00:00,Anyone relate or explain,"When i meditate and do the usual take the breath all the way in and hold it at the end or at some point. I get a numbing feeling and lightheaded feeling but not a bad one , kind of like a blissful moment. My ego washes away and in the moment able to see clearly while my eyes are closed. But sometimes when it does happen, i get a fear in me and things start to expose upfront like , my decisions ive made, the oath im going to, am i going to the right path. All in that split second. Idk if anyone else as experienced this"
xpege,2021-04-28 20:31:07+00:00,Question about mindfulness,Hey guys! I am pretty new to meditation but today during my mindfulness practise while concentrating on the breathe touching my nostrils after like 10 minutes I felt like my breathe just slowed down and then I couldn’t feel it at all anymore. I continued for like 3-4 minutes after that but I wasn’t sure what I would concentrate on anymore. So I am asking is this a good thing and development on my practise or is it a dead end and I should change something on my practise? Thank you for all in advance!❤️
F1337wood,2021-04-28 20:28:14+00:00,Would like to share an experience I had today in hopes that it may help others have a similar experience.,"To start with, I've been meditating for a few years, but not with enough regularity, say a couple times a week for 10 or 15 minutes. You know, enough to say I'm meditating, but not enough to actually get any benefits. 


For the last couple months I've committed my self to meditating more regularly in hopes of reaching some form of higher consciousness and seeing some results in my daily life. I'm still not great about doing it every day, but 5 or 6 days per week vs 2 or 3 has felt like a big difference for me. When on the cushion, I still experience a lot of mind wandering from the breath, but off the cushion I have noticed a huge improvement in my attitude. Life is pretty stressful for me right now, but even still I find my overactive adhd mind that has driven me to so much anxiety in the past now finds the positive aspects of my life much more attractive. I still dwell on negative stuff from time to time obviously, but its like my mind is more buoyant, so even when heavy thoughts come, I find it much easier to rise through them, instead of letting them weigh me down.


This morning I was reading some about Pranayama, a practice of yoga I'd heard mentioned before but never knew anything about, and came across a description of the breath in Ujjayi Pranayama that seemed interesting. It described creating a pocket of air in the back of the throat like you are about to whisper a secret, while breathing through the nose. I found this a fascinating description, found it relatively easy to do, and sat down to try focusing on this more involved kind of breathing. The results were slow at first, but after a few minutes I found myself snoring. I realized then this was the same kind of breathing I must do when I sleep, and by being mindful of how I shaped the air in the back of my throat, I could continue this kind of whisper breathing without my usual fog horn snoring. While doing this I was not distracted by needing to swallow or sneeze or yawn as is usual for me; it felt like my body all on its own settled into the rhythmic breathing of sleep that never needs to sneeze or swallow, and for the first time, I think I felt my mind resting. 


Fully concentrated on maintaining this feeling in the breath, I meditated for 40 minutes barely realizing how much time had passed. Time finally seemed to slip from my awareness, and there was only the breath. I decided to open my eyes after what felt like just a few more minutes, and since then I still feel a little more present and aware of myself than I did this morning.


Here is the link to the article if anyone is interested:

Hope this can help someone else have the same breakthrough feeling on the cushion that I got today. Peace to you all, and good luck on your journey."
CrazyCale22,2021-04-28 20:05:45+00:00,How much can you learn from books before you need a teacher?,I’ve read many of the most acclaimed books on meditation and several books on Buddhism trying to piece together right understanding. Mostly my lack of progress has to do with a lack of consistency but assuming I got that in order would I need a personal guide before I can experience a moderate depth in my practice?
13asky,2021-04-28 19:30:04+00:00,Senses are your primary enemies when it comes to focus and meditation,"In vedas and sanatana dharma the key to achieving self control or ensuring your mind and heart are aligning which opens the kundalini energy of your chakras and always helping you to be self conscious and self aware. The way that most of the kids that were trained from childhood is through gurukul or staying at guru(teachers house) and learning everything by giving up their self of ego and identity and mastery over all the senses. A man who has truly understood how to control his senses and can see through all the facade can see through his mano netra (the vision that is projected when we close our eyes) or the third eye. Now how can senses cheat you ? 

The senses are designed to intake information as per their duty (dharma) the eyes see, the nose smells, the ears listen, the tongue tastes and the skin feels a touch. All these senses cannot be controlled except for eyes and hence we can always close our eyes or divert our vision away as soon as we see something unpleasant or something which we did not want to see. Now filtering this information is what the brain does and each sense can trigger specific emotion. These emotions can spiral thoughts into either desire or anger. Now desire has multiple layers and anger is caused by unfulfilled desire.
For someone starting to understand how to meditate as soon as you start closing your eyes you could realize the mind is still projecting visuals near your third eye chakra. First question the thought and categorize it with your sense i.e is this projection something that I saw or heard or listened, then understand the trigger points of such projections and try to get a better understanding of what exactly is diverting you from concentrating on your self. The deeper understanding you have of your trigger points the more aware you become, the more aware you are the more conscious you become thus becoming unlocking the potential. However all these are just the beginning there is more to this... feel free to correct me, or share your thoughts if this is genuine I would like to write more. I am trying to use this controlling of energy to a greater manifestation."

I am very open-minded. I love the mediation and astral projection communities. I get deep into literature and I love reading about everyone's experience, suggestions, and the like! 


I just watch all 3 parts of the documentary UNACKNOWLEDGED. The most recent one, the 2020 release is HIGHLY relatable to this sub, with a core focus on meditation and consciousness. 

I am curious to know if any of you have seen the documentary and what your thoughts are on the information delivered there around meditation and consciousness. How frickin cool!"

The first time I heard this statement, I thought it was an overstatement meant to glorify meditation. That being said, after many years of experiment and practice, I have to agree with those words. Meditation is really something that will change your life for the better. Not only that, it will also be beneficial to the people around you, and, also, the world at large."

I was clearly feeling less stressed and anxious but I wasn't getting any of the insight benefits that I hear can happen if you really focus on that. 

I'd like to start meditating again with the goal of gaining insight. I'm aware that I'll need to do things differently and give more effort, but not sure exactly how to go about it. I am interested in preparing for a retreat at some point in the future when that becomes the logical next step. Is there some book that can help me to start on this path and give me guidance as I progress? (I saw that there was a thread with book recommendations, but there was no way for me to discern which books are relevant to what I want to achieve without researching all of them.

For context, this source is where I'm getting a lot of my information about Vipassana and insight. I don't know how trustworthy it is, so please correct any misassumptions I'm making.

saf4ri,2021-04-28 16:13:18+00:00,Mind wandering to bizarre thoughts that I can't remember after meditating,Hey y'all I'm relatively new to meditating and while I'm doing it my mind is randomly wandering to really bizarre thoughts that I can't remember after the session. It's almost like I'm dreaming but I'm fully awake. Is that normal? I do 3 sessions every day and each of them is 30 minutes.
nk127,2021-04-28 16:05:03+00:00,An idea that did not sound appealing or convincing proved to be very effective.,"I am an over thinker. More than over thinking what hurts me most is being too involved with thoughts with adrenaline. I imagine/create scenarios in my mind as if my world is crumbling and i have to be the savior with my talk.

I did a great meditative session today(Advanced:Mind by Michael Taft on Simple Habit). The session spoke about mental images and mental chatter. It made me understand that what i suffer from is a mixture of both(moving images with mental chatter). The teacher explained very gently to how labeling them or calling them out will not make us engage with thoughts.

Though this form of meditation did not sound appealing, it proved to be effective. I had been trying different versions of meditation on this 14 day streak and this gave me the best tenderness and freshness. It gave me a way to undermine my unnecessarily heavy thoughts.

Why is it this good? Am i doing the other forms(focussing on breath or chakras) wrongly? Secondly - which state is better - a state of no thinking or a state of awareness of your thoughts? Please feel free to share any of your related observations."

Sea_Cold301,2021-04-28 15:00:22+00:00,Anyone experience not sleeping due to meditation?,"I started meditating to fix sleep. It worked amazingly and I slept like a baby for 8 hours a night for a long time now. I've since plunged deeper into this non-duality state and I completely know I am not my thoughts or self, just the awareness of it all. It's been an intense adjustment. I find it's a shift I cannot reverse now. A few times now lately, I lay in bed and deep peace and euphoria surround me, and I do not sleep. I will lay there all night, and feel euphoric, but never actually fall asleep. The next day, like today, I sit here and feel this insanely deep peace after not sleeping at all, but my thinking mind is groggy, dull, I struggle with basic tasks. However when I close my eyes, I simply feel this deep, crystal clear peace again. I have young children, and a very demanding job. I have no clue what to make of this. My thinking mind wishes to reverse it, and gets scared because I am in unchartered territory alone.  Laying in bed without sleeping and still feeling peaceful, is very disturbing to my old self and mind. I know I have kids to take care of, and cannot afford to live in the mountains alone! Has this happened to anyone?"
shubrownie,2021-04-28 14:55:50+00:00,Setting aside time to explore Pain and Anguish within your practice,"3 weeks ago, I was having a really tough time meditating. Over the course of a few  sessions, I experienced lot of difficulties focusing on my breathing, it felt like my mind was racing more than usual and at a faster pace. I kept having repetitive thoughts and was unable to get settled.

Given that I was not making any progress on the breathing component, I decided to go explore the what was actually going on. I believe that my subconscious was trying to tell me something but I was not able to decipher it, which is why I was experiencing the mental discomfort.

These are the steps I took to further understand what was going on.

* I first tried to label the feeling. Was it sadness? Loneliness? Anxiety? Anger? Was it a combination of different feelings?

* Once I was able to determine how I felt, I tried try to get to the root cause of the issue. I went back in my memory to previous interactions with others, my previous thought processes, my childhood interactions with my parents.

* When I was satisfied with what I thought was the root cause of my issues, I told myself “These things happen in life, it has happened already, try to accept it”

At every step, I would continue to converse with myself until I was able to feel “yes this is it” and it felt like it was the right answer. For a lack of a better term, I felt the answer. It was a physical feeling of release. Eventually I had a feeling of looseness and when I went back to my breathing, I was able to focus much easier.

What I have described above very similar to yoga, when the instructor tells you to mentally key in on the area of tightness as a way to release it.

Let me know your thoughts on this"
Astral-foundations,2021-04-28 14:50:05+00:00,Does anyone else feel like meditation makes them less angry?,"I've struggled with anger for a long time and am very good at thinking myself into a bad mood, sifting through my resentments, often lasting the rest of the day. A lot of the time I'll excessively clench my jaw, and let my emotions over things that happened months or years ago affect my schoolwork, relationships, and enjoyment of normal life activities.

I started meditating about 5 years ago and have been pretty on and off in that time. When Covid started I decided I wanted to really take it seriously and do it as much as possible. I currently do it most days. I've noticed this past year that in phases when I'm regularly doing it, the angry days don't happen nearly as much. Sometimes life happens and I don't do it for a week or so, or do it infrequently for a period of time, and notice the intrusive thoughts come more, and are harder to shove off. 

Any of you guys experience this?"
5gtpepper,2021-04-28 13:56:07+00:00,Ego death?,"About a fortnight ago I started to meditate almost daily, and for the first time something different than just me watching my breath happened. Firstly, the only difference this time related to previous ones was that I put my alarm to beep after 13 minutes, and not the usual 10. Okay, so after the first 10 minutes I had the sensation of making backflips repeatedly, and the speed was increasing constantly. After a while it got so fast that I couldn't tell how fast it was anymore, and here's when it happened: there was no longer a rotation, neither had I a body to feel it; for some seconds it was very clear to me that I've become a single head, and then it just disappeared. After this the alarm beeped. 

The same sensation here (sensation of movement followed by lost of self conciousness) was described by Michael Stevens on the Mind Field's episode in which he tries ayahuasca, and the ego death is mentioned as one of the psychedelic effects. Do you guys think I had some sort of ego death or it's just the normal meditation effect?"
mpspenguin,2021-04-28 13:49:48+00:00,Uncomfortable with peace?,"I've had a few experiences, both while meditating and on psychedelics, where my mind went so still that only awareness remained. And from everything I've studied, that's kinda the goal (or at least a good sign of progress), yet every time it's happened I've had this knee jerk recoil reaction, where my ego kicks in and this overwhelming sadness rushes in.   


It's not a typical sadness about something pertaining to me, but rather a deep, impersonal sorrow, like a ""oh, this is how it is"". Like Ive seen a glimpse of reality and I'm disappointed by it, because I still want something more, something concrete to cling to. Then my mind starts racing about how nothing will ever be good enough for me- and I wonder if it's even possible to separate myself from that underlying hunger that seems to drive existence. It feels like the universe is insatiable, and it scares me.

I know there's a good chance I'm just projecting my own issues. I have PTSD and thanatophobia (fear of death), so I've been in fight or flight most of my life. It's just discouraging that even when I do manage to stumble upon peace, I cant seem to stomach it. It sort of feels like I'm giving up somehow, and that thats a dangerous thing to do. There's a surrender that happens that I always pull away from. I don't want peace; I want euphoria, and I'm scared that's gonna ruin my life.

Has anyone had experience with this sort of block? I feel like my anxiety is just so adaptable that it'll ruin anything these days, no matter how good I have it."
lezorte,2021-04-28 13:29:34+00:00,Some questions about staying conscious while falling asleep during meditation,"So to start out with a little bit of background: I've been practicing getting myself into a very deep state of relaxation in a relatively short period of time while meditating and have found a lot of success with it. I had an experience this morning where I was doing just that and noticed a very strange thing happening. I felt myself being aware of the fact that I started dreaming and I was able to stop the dream and switch back to a state of raw conscious awareness (not sure if I'm using that term right but basically I was back to having no thoughts and just feeling aware of my existence). And this repeated probably 10 times where I would feel my mind start dreaming again and I would immediately choose to switch back to conscious awareness. So I'm wondering if there are other people who are more experienced with this phenomenon and could maybe explain what exactly is going on and if this is something that unlocks new possibilities in new meditation. For example:  


* Was I actually asleep and conscious during it or was I just consciously waking myself back up each time I found myself dreaming?
* Is this even a healthy/safe thing to do to the brain or could I accidentally turn myself into an insomniac if I keep doing this?
* If this is safe, can it be ""mastered"" in order to allow myself to sleep and meditate at the same time for long periods of time? Would there be a benefit to that?
* Are there techniques that, when added to this, can be used to induce things like lucid dreaming or even astral projection (if you believe in that)

So I tried meditation for the first time this morning - a 12 minute session of just breathing in and out, basically - having been interested in trying it for a while. Thought 'why are you putting it off', and kinda just went for it eventually.

My expectations were it'd put me in a state of calm, and then likely boredom, and for the first at a guess 6 or 7 minutes it was sorta like this. I remembered to put a book in my bag before work, and I was aware of my head feeling a little funny but nothing too wild.

What I didn't expect was the anxiety that rushed in. A really silly thing popped up - 'what if my alarm doesn't go off' - which became really, really horrible at one point despite it being really quite nominal. I tried to appreciate what it was that I was feeling, but then the alarm went off and I had to get on with my day.

I don't even think I'd describe the experience as pleasant, but I'd definitely say it warrants further investigation. Thanks for reading  my brain dump :\]"

sakshi-niranjan,2021-04-28 05:11:55+00:00,The eye as an output device,"Perhaps I'm re-stating the obvious, but please bear with me.

The eye is well known as an input device, a biological camera that is able to capture the frequency and wavelength (ie., color and brightness) of light falling on it, and convert it to an electric signal that is supplied to the brain.

Literature also mentions that the eye is a mirror of the mind and that it can reflect emotions (such as peace, anger, or desire). Even when the eye is closed, it can expose the state of the mind. Thus, during REM sleep, the rapid eye movements are a consequence of thoughts/dreams/mental activity in sleep. In these states, the eye becomes an output device providing measurable information on the state of the mind to the outside world.

Consequently, for the meditator, eyes appear to be good indicators of the stillness of the mind. If your eye is steady and unwavering, then your mind is still, and vice versa."

Psyzhran2357,2021-04-28 04:09:39+00:00,Questions about sitting on a Zafu,"1. I recently got a zafu, and when looking at pictures of how to use it, most of them have their bottom resting on the cushion and their legs on the floor or on a zabuton. However, I've also seen some pictures of people sitting with their entire body on the cushion, particularly on the Amazon product page where I got mine. Obviously there's no one true way to sit on the cushion, but I'm wondering if there's any benefits having your legs on the cushion rather than on the floor?
2. My right foot points out to the side when my legs are facing forward; I'm worried it might be external tibial torsion. I usually sit in Burmese posture when I'm meditating, but since my right foot out-toes, I end up feeling a lot of pressure on my ankle if I sit in Burmese style for extended periods of time, no matter if my right foot is on the outside or the inside. However, the cushion is just wide enough that kneeling on in seiza it feels awkward, my hip flexors are too tight for me to perform full lotus, and sitting cross legged normally puts too much pressure on my bottom shin and ankle. Right now I'm trying to see if I can get myself comfortable with half-lotus on the zafu, but if you people have any suggestions for how to deal with my out-toeing right foot that would be great, as I find Burmese easier to maintain than half-lotus.
3. Typically when meditating, I have my hands either on my lap in the Dhyana mudra, or grabbing my knees. However, when sitting on the zafu, it raises my body up to the point that my knees are just out of reach. I can still rest my hands in the Dhyana mudra, but when sitting in Burmese posture, pretty much the only thing supporting my hands are my ""man parts"", so it feels unstable. Half-lotus is steadier, as I can rest my hands in the Dhyana mudra on my top foot, but my knees are still too far away for me to grab. What are some common places to put your hands if your zafu is just a little bit too tall for you?"

shadylimbo,2021-04-28 01:18:30+00:00,"I think I had my first meditative experience, and right now my mind is completely calm for the first time in years. How do I replicate this feeling?","So, some backstory. I have severe anxiety. Like, I have trouble leaving my room or dealing with stressful situations without having panic attacks.  Hell, I have trouble not keeping my mind constantly occupied. And I had tried meditating before to ease that, but like, I guess you could say my mind was too loud? It was too intense to be able to stick with it. So I gave up.

Now, to what’s actually important.
Right now, it’s raining outside. I live in a very dry, desert climate, so rain is a very rare thing. So, I decided to sit down on my porch, and watch the rain for a bit.

As I was watching the rain, I decided to close my eyes and just listen to the rain.

Basically the second my eyes were closed, everything became silent, and the earth became still. It was almost like I felt nothing at all. The only thing I could really feel was my own body, sitting in the chair, and I felt like a statue. Sometimes I could feel the wind, but that was it.

When this happened, it almost felt like my mind went into repair mode. I was thinking of the things currently bothering me in life, and it was almost like I was asking and answering my own questions, like an inner dialogue. I also was encouraging myself to get better, and to heal what was causing me to shut myself off from the world like I do. I can already say, I just experienced one of the most profound moments of my entire life. Looking back, it was intense. But during, it felt like nothing was happening at all.

Once I sort of came to, 30 whole minutes had passed, the rain was coming down extremely hard, and I was soaking wet lol. It only felt like seconds, however.

I’m sorry for that almost unreadable text.

But, was that meditation? And if so, how do I capture that again?"

Zealousideal-Ad3734,2021-04-27 21:15:33+00:00,Hinderance: I make the best plans WHILE IM MEDITATING,"Okay so my mind tends to orient towards future planning when I am not being mindful (as it does for many of us). When I engage in sitting meditation, the mind also frequently strays away in order to make future plans. If these were just typical plans, I would simply acknowledge the planning mind and then gently bring my attention back to the breath. However, I seem to come up with excellent plans while I meditate? It’s not even when I’m being mindful of the plans, it’s just when my mind is lost in the story of the plan. Yet, so often the plans I come up with while sitting are so good that I have to pause my meditation session (or ignore the breath) and continue indulging the plan. What do I do about this? I love that I’m randomly coming up with good plans for my future, but it SERIOUSLY distracts me from meditating and therefore hinders my progress! 

Thanks everyone :)"

I teach meditation and mindfulness and I'm also a therapist.  A few weeks back I noticed I was feeling anxiety and when I inquired into it while meditating I found a subtle (but significant) feeling of shame.

I've also found this pattern in clients who suffer from anxiety.  Of course not all anxiety is repressed shame, but it was more common than I had realized.

Thebestshipis,2021-04-27 19:46:14+00:00,Every time I meditate I get a panic attack caused by noticing my breath. Has anyone else experienced this and worked through it?,"I have had an ongoing problem for *many* years where every time I notice my breathing I start to feel like I can't breath. I try my best to take controlled breaths in these moments because I know that hyperventilating just causes greater panic. I've gone to a doctor about this in case it was caused by something medical but it was confirmed to be just anxiety. 

I also struggle with being far too reactive and feeling overpowered by my thoughts and emotions. I believe that meditation would be a great help if I could actually do it. But every time I sit down to do it I make it about 5 minutes before having a panic attack. I once tried to work through it and did a meditation once a day for a week, but the panic attacks didn't get better so I stopped. I have tried anchoring myself with my breath (to make peace with it), with my body, with guided meditations...nothing seems to work. Whenever I anchor myself with something else I still seem to get fixated on my breathing. I get a panic attack and start crying, as silly as this sounds, from fear since my body feels like it's being suffocated. It often takes me about 10 minutes to recover. 

Has anyone been through this? Is there light at the end of this tunnel? I have no idea how to work through this and I would love to be able to just sit with myself without feeling like I'm dying. Thank you in advance for any advice that may be given, or to anyone who just wants to share their experience."
SasquatchMini,2021-04-27 19:39:03+00:00,Is the ongoing mental narration of thoughts and external stimuli while meditating typical?,"I've been practicing for a little over a month, and I'm feeling kind of stuck.

During practice I feel that I am able to remove myself from being caught in the river of thought and can watch stray thoughts come and go without judgement, or chasing a train of thought. I typically watch my breath or become hyper aware of the sensations and sounds in my environment instead.

The problem I'm having is that there's an ongoing narration in my mind, and I'm not sure if this is a regular part of mediation that everyone experiences, or if I'm distracting myself from the practice unintentionally. 

For example, I am constantly counting my breaths, labeling things I hear/feel around me (""the clouds have shifted because I feel warmer, there's a bird in that tree chirping, my dog is snoring, I hear someone mowing their lawn"")

It seems like internal narration is something everyone has. If it's not, then how do you bring your attention back to just watching thoughts instead of chasing them? I don't really see many people talking about what their inner voice is doing as they meditate and I wonder if I've been doing it wrong this whole time."

Today’s been an interesting day so far. My cable’s out. No WiFi and I’m running off my phone’s hotspot. I’ve been banned from Twitter for 6 days for violating some rule and they have yet to explain to me after several emails. So I’ve spent the day in the apartment with two dogs, my roommate’s Alex a 4 year old Fox Terrier (she’s a girl) and mine, Eltro a 7 month old Bull Terrier (a boy) just listening to music with the windows open. Sounds from outside drifting in. Eating my no moo yogurt with berries and kashi berry crumble cereal mixed in. Thinking about what to make for dinner. Slowly texting my mom. Probably going to go cancel my membership to my favorite charity: the gym. Need to change the battery on my scooter, that should take some time. It’s just nice that there’s absolutely no rush today. No WiFi and being banned forced me to turn inwards... which was needed. It’s like the universe said, “Let’s pump the breaks a bit. Pull over and enjoy the view.” Sometimes you don’t know what you need till you need it. Till you’re forced to look at yourself. I’ll always take some good introspection.

The objects are arising and I'm aware of them, but for brief periods of time the ""me"" that feels it's perceiving fades away and there is only the perception itself.

It feels very peaceful, but not happy or joyful or loving. It feels empty but not sad. I've read about others having some kind of peak experience in meditation (samadhi or something like it) and I've read it can feel ecstatic or mystical for some people. 

Am I meditating correctly? Does anyone else have this experience? Is this the ""point"" or meditation?"
mass8790,2021-04-27 15:11:53+00:00,Meditation Excerpt,"The Voice of Babaji

Chapter XI of “The Voice of Babaji—A Trilogy on Kriya Yoga,” by V.T. Neelakantan, S.A.A. Ramaiah, Babaji Nagaraj. 

        The first paragraph on page 211 clearly shows how the One plane allows for freedom. In a single frame, every aspect is whole. 

       Through the seeming conflict of the of the world, there is a plane which every one is in.  “The light shineth in the darkness and the darkness understandeth it not,” or close to the quote (don’t remember exactly).  Suffice it to say, the darkness is a mere shadow of Light, with seeming consciousness.  

       Yet, just as a shadow moves in reference to an object in the sun, it is not separate.  The plane is all encompassing.  For this reason, it is a privilege to be in.  To leave is to change the delegation of Love and alter the character of a person.  For this reason, it is not a responsibility or a privilege to communicate with darkness, for in being darkness It has complete dictatorship of what vibration it is in, seemingly.  

       To communicate Light to Light is the method, for it is the only thing which is True. If apparent darkness is there, see it only in reference to Light, for that what the apparent darkness is.  God is all; “Aum Kriya Babaji Namaha, Satguru deva Namaste, Satguru deva dayakapara, satguru deva kshama.”  

       God is all—Do not give the darkness the privilege of your precious love. The God is all—their mere vibration should be seen as such. Allow the never-ending clarity of Light to be the in residence, do not listen or take queues from darkness, for it is acting in a single  vibration,  not clarity, which is synonymous and the same as Light."
Roseraiin,2021-04-27 14:48:39+00:00,Why do we meditate for others?,"After using meditation guide apps, and videos. I’ve noticed that meditation at the start is for yourself, so you can improve your life, and be calm and reflective of your emotions and move forward with them. But I’ve noticed that when using guided meditations, the teachers usually say something along the lines of, “how can taking this time for yourself improve the life of others around you,” and I’ve contemplated it’s meaning for a while, but I’m still struggling to understand it. 

My take is that by being reflective of your mind, and embracing your emotions, you gain the ability to do so for others. To be compassionate for what they feel, and understanding that they’re people too with their own emotions and thoughts. By embracing your emotions and understanding them, you can be more understanding of others as well, but I’m curious to what you guys think? 
 
I’ve looked around online, but most questions are for oneself. Like, “why should I mediate, how can I mediate, why do you mediate?” with the premise always being oneself. Not saying that is wrong by any means, but I’ve haven’t come across anything regarding others. Either way, I appreciate the read! Thanks!"

I've been practicing mindfulness meditation somewhat consistently for about a year now - typically 10-20 minutes a day and a few times where I've down 45+ mins. 

I realize I need to do longer sessions because I struggle with aspects of life that require insurance. 

One thing I noticed yesterday in one of my long sessions is that my focus on attention shifts from the breath to sounds, to sensations in my body. It doesn't like to stay on one point of focus the whole time. 

I think I have more thoughts than the average person running through my head at all times based on my ADHD so when I'm noticing my body/breath or any sensation that alone was an accomplishment.

Do you have any suggestions on how I can keep it on one object the whole time? Should I be shifting from mindfulness-based meditation to mantra-based? 

***TL;DR: My mind loves to shift from one object on concentration to the next in longer sessions of mindfullness-based meditation. Any tips on how I can work on keeping it to one? It is important to me in my life to get a handle on shifting my attention from one thing to another.***"

Started meditating in 2019 after awakening. Vibration raised naturally and ascension symptoms began to take place. I managed to heal some of my past negative emotions.

Here's where the problem is: I've reached a plateau with my healing. I'm being called by my intuition to heal my unprocessed emotions, and I am aware they're present, but every time I sit down to meditate on them, I literally can't feel into the emotion.

This has been ridiculously effing frustrating for me. Throughout the day, for example, I'll feel the emotion's presence in my body. So then, I'll sit down to try and be present with it, but I dont know how to fully feel the emotion and be present with it. Anyone have any help?

I've recently gotten back to meditating after many years of absence. It's been about two weeks of practicing mindfulness meditation. In truth, I have a lot of negative thoughts and emotions. Emptiness is a major part of my experience and always has been. I had forgotten how absolutely essential mindfulness is to switch off of this thinking.

I digress. One thing I've noticed recently is that at points during meditation I may start to notice negative emotions and thoughts coming up. One technique I find useful in probing these things is asking myself ""Is this true?"" Not always but at times I feel a shift into my heart and start laughing. Not out loud chest laughing but deep, short, and quick belly laughs through the nostrils. It feels good but foreign. I am not sure why I'm laughing.

Knowing our issues is not the same as healing our
issues. In fact, knowing is often a willful act, entirely
incongruent with the experience of surrender required
to heal. I have known many who could name their
patterns and issues—almost like they had done a
science experiment on their own consciousness-
but nothing changed because they refused to come
back down into their bodies and move their feelings
through to transformation. It's safe up there, above
the fray, witnessing the pain-body without actually
engaging it. The key to the transformation of
challenging patterns and wounds is to heal them from
the inside out. Not to analyze them, not to watch them
like an astronomer staring at a faraway planet through
a telescope, but to jump right into the heart of them,
encouraging their expression and release, stitching
them into new possibilities with the thread of love.

For the deepest meditation, you must not only have the ability to focus your consciousness completely on one object, you must also have the ability to make awareness itself be that object (the one you're going to focus on).

In the highest state, the focus of consciousness is turned back to the self.

borj5960,2021-04-27 03:56:54+00:00,Gift for someone who is in to meditation,"Hi folks, thank you for reading my thread. My mother has recently been doing a lot of meditating. She shared with me that she used to meditate a lot in her younger days, but then stopped. In the past year she's begun meditating again, and it seems to be very important to her. I can also notice a huge change in her personality when she's meditating. She seems calmer, happier, it's a wonderful thing she's doing.

She's helped me a lot recently and am trying to think of a good gift to get for her. I'm wondering if there's something I could get her, that would help with meditating, or help encourage her to meditate more. Do you have any ideas? Is there anything helpful for you? Even as simple as a book or music I could buy her? I don't meditate so I'm really not sure. Thanks so much if you have any advice!"

usernamesarehard-__-,2021-04-27 02:18:11+00:00,Need a simple exercise for calming down,"Hello there,

I would like to preface this post with me saying that I suffer from generalized anxiety and addiction which I got to therapy for (I'm not sure what all I can and can't say on the sub, but I'll say it's a digital addiction.) 

I'm not looking for relationship advice, but just as background, I'm the jealous type. All of my relationships have been online except for one, and most have ended with the girlfriend cheating or causing some unhealed wounds. My most recent relationship ended weirdly, and I thought she was a catfish towards the end. Long story short, I'm having a hard time with addiction and went back to talking with her.

She's definitely a gamer, but I have a lot of jealousy and insecurities that come up when I think about her talking to other people. I get really jealous when she choses to do other activities by herself or talk with her friends over me. I totally understand it's a me problem and, I want her to talk to friends. I just need some form of exercise I can do to not feel so anxious or jealous. Any suggestions?

Idk if this is relevant, but I'm a 19 year old male."
journeyswithawolf,2021-04-27 02:15:28+00:00,"How are you to be present, but also in your feels?","As I'm trying to work through heartbreak and explore things holding myself back, I'm kind of stuck at this. 

To be present would mean you're not in your emotions. No depression, anxiety, fears, etc. Not only in meditation, but believing in the law of attraction you don't want to give any energy to those kinds of thoughts or emotions, right? I even recall Joe Dispenza saying something similar to if you're living in the now there's no room for depression and anxiety.
At the same time you don't want to suppress emotions but instead really dive deep and explore them. 

So how do you do both? When do you do one or the other?
How can you be present but still feel the painful experience of something that has happened? 
(Doesn't have to be pain, just easiest to use in my example)"
RL_angel,2021-04-27 02:03:55+00:00,Mindfulness Meditation vs. Sudden Realization,"The pervading view in the meditation community is that in order to get to a place where your feel free and liberated, interconnected and present, as the norm, you must spend many years meditating to reach that point. 

But actually it's been my experience that it only takes many years when your practice is concentration-focused. For example the typical mindfulness meditation instruction, ""focus on your breath"", is telling the ""person"" - the web of thoughts, associations &amp; stories in the brain that we think is ""us"", to take on the task of finding the breath as an object and then keeping its focus on it while repeatedly moving that focus away from distractions. The person temporarily takes on another role - ""the meditator"". 

This isn't bad. It still reduces ruminating thought and calms the body, helping many people feel better. 

In non-dual pointing instructions however, ""The person"" is seen through completely within minutes, and no meditator role is created. Instead, there is a direct entry into **an unconditioned, encompassing Now** in which all experience flows seamlessly. 

Rather than an eyes-closed pointed focus on a single object (like the breath), the awareness is instantly expanded outside the constraints of any ""focuser"" or ""meditator"" perspective, into the vibrant spaciousness that all of experience is arising within, including the subtle energy of the body, and everything in the room and beyond. Think of the experience standing at the top of a mountain with a beautiful view, feeling infinitely wide open and connected to everything. Now take that same feeling, but simply sitting in your living room. 

Such instant recognition often comes paired with the rapid reprogramming of the brain in the form of spontaneous energetic release (instances of faster or deeper breathing, spontaneous stretching, trembling or contorting of the body, even vocalizations). 

In buddhism these are called piti, in Yogic traditions they are called kriyas. In my modern view, it's simply the body rapidly reversing and unraveling the various tensions from the old conditioning that was stored throughout in the nerves and muscles.

Some people experience small amounts of this energy-release with mindfulness meditation (there have been posts in this sub talking about it), which shows that they're seeing tiny glimpses of that unconditioned awareness. But nondual pointing instructions can give very ""wow""-inducing, big glimpses of it. And it's very transformative to the nervous system. 

Now you're probably wondering ""if it's so powerful why doesn't anyone know about it???"" Well the reason such instructions aren't so well known is because traditionally they have been kept secret, reserved for monks and serious meditation practitioners who have studied under particular teachers for years (in the places where mindfulness meditation was originally developed like Tibet). However there are some western teachers who were able to get the pointing instructions and now teach them to westerners who desire to be shown. 

I personally am not one of those teachers but I do have my favorites. They're all on Youtube:

Loch Kelly
Joan Tollifson
Alan Wallace
Eckhart Tolle
Rupert Spira

I personally find Loch Kelly to be by far the most clear, thorough and easy to follow without being too esoteric (his pointers are also on Sam Harris's app). Personally working with his particular instructions for a while, made the teachings of Eckhart Tolle and other more well known teachers resonate so much more, like I truly ""get it"" now. But the other teachers are also very good and some people may very well resonate more with them instead, perhaps the language certain teachers use clicks better for some than others. 

Anyway, I just wanted to offer this for anyone who's been doing mindfulness meditation for a while and would like to explore the next level of realization. Thanks for reading and have a joyful day. If anyone has nondual practice experience to share, or any questions, feel free."

BeizedBurnebn,2021-04-27 02:01:09+00:00,This 35-Minute Session Combines my Favorite parts of inner-world stuff,"Meditation, mental exercises, and law of attraction always seemed like this key to me living a less-stressed and more abundant life.

But I quickly found that these things can get lost in a messy web of sorts. Should I sit down to just be present and meditate? Should I sit here to work on mental focus exercises? Should I do some real law of attraction visualization and seeding practices? 

It all seemed like a lot.

Now, I've realized that I can kinda do whatever I want with my mind. So I decided to combine all these into a 35 minute session. It's not perfect, and of course it's hard when your mind slips... but sticking with this has lead to me being more calm, focused, and generally more vibrant and abundant.

I hope something along these lines can do the same for you :)

Here’s how my 35 minute meditation sessions have worked out thus far:

* 5 minutes of body presence. Scanning my body, paying attention to how it feels. Scanning it up with my inhales, and down with my exhales.
* 5 minutes of seeding and visualizing healed ears. I have tinnitus. Meditation has been proven to help tinnitus, and my mantras are helping me to get more excited over having silent ears.
* 5 minutes of seeding and visualizing myself going day-to-day in the PRESENT moment. Feeling focused on the present. Not lost in thought. If I get lost in thought, it’s okay. But for the most part, the idea is to be Zen.
* 5 minutes of seeding and visualizing me making my own money. “I make my own money, in my own way, with my own skills.” I visualize getting Stripe payments. Right now the goal is to make $1000 a month with my own personal endeavors. That’s just the start, and I’ll increase it from there.
* 5 minutes of seeding and visualizing me being *focused* and *decisive*. “I am focused. I am decisive.” I’m not game for being constantly distracted and multitasking and not really committing to a business idea or to one creative idea. So this is to seed that in my brain.
* 5 minutes of returning to the present moment with body scans. Like the first 5 minutes. I also try to feel stillness towards the very end. Where I just zone out and feel the energy in the room.

That's from my Medium account, which I started because in addition to doing this every day, I'm trying to publish either written stuff or video stuff every day. To get comfortable with finding my voice.

Meditation, mental exercises, and loa don't have to be these strict, anxiety-inducing things. That's counter-intuitive, which is kinda how our brains work sometimes. I've been stressed by those things before... but I find this exercise helps me find the sweet spot of what I'm looking for with the inner world. I hope it helps you too!"

dalda1,2021-04-26 22:55:26+00:00,Sharing my experience with meditation,"Hopefully I can motivate some people out there to start meditating by sharing my own experience and the huge benefits I’ve gained because of meditation.
(Excuse me for my English)

I (22M) started meditating one year ago after the Corona outbreak and I can honestly say that it was one of the best decisions of my life. I always knew there were scientifically proven benefits to meditation, but it was hard for me to start actually practicing it, because I knew no people who meditated and it didn’t seem like something you would do just out of the ordinary. Then this basketball documentary about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls came out (The Last Dance) and it showed me how many successful athletes use meditation consistently to boost their performance and mindset. I love sports and try to be ambitious myself and this showed me there is value in meditation.This triggered me to start my journey with meditation.

After I watched the documentary I started browsing on this reddit for tips to get started with meditation. I also watched some YouTube videos and read some books of Eckhart Tolle to learn more about being mindful and present. I wanted to use an app to meditate and I ended up with Headspace. I was disciplined and motivated enough to practice meditation daily and I started with an NBA guided mindset meditation. The first days it was really hard for me the keep my mind still and to concentrate on my thoughts. I didn’t feel like I was getting better at it and I didn’t feel any significant benefits. After about 10 days I started noticing I was better at keeping my mind still and distancing myself from my thoughts. I felt so relieved after each meditation and I felt even more relaxed and focussed at the same time. The 2nd and the 3th month I was meditating daily, for a longer time period (20 min) and more repetitions (2-3 times). My daily meditation routine literally caused me to feel like a different person after these months of practice. I became more focussed, happier, present, spontaneous, creative, social, productive, open-minded, flexible and the lists goed on and on. I have developed huge emotional intelligence because of meditation. I felt like I attracted more positive people towards me, more positive experiences and more joy. I felt more present and alive experiencing all of this than any i have ever felt in any other time period in my life. Another benefit was that my energy became unreal. I would have very active days with studying, working, fitness, practicing sports, reading books, socialize and still feel the energy to do more. This felt like the best, happiest and most alive time of my life. 

After this time period during winter there was a 2nd lockdown in my country because of the Corona pandemic. This caused to develop bad habits like gaming a lot, not working out, isolating myself etc. Eventually I had lost the discipline to meditate and I ended op not meditating at all. I had recognized that not meditating caused me to lose a lot of the benefits that I felt before and my life didn’t feel as lively as before. During February 2021 this year I had enough of not taking action against my bad habits and I started bettering myself again. After months of hard work I am back on track with all the good habits I had before and I am meditating daily for a few weeks now. I picked up on my meditation skills real quick and the results showed much faster than when I first started meditating. Today was the first time I felt so powerfully present and conscious again because of meditation and I know that I will succeed to become even more present from now on. 

I want everyone to know that these benefits of meditation are very real and to my opinion it is one of the best habits you can implement in your life. Hopefully my experience motivates you guys to educate yourself further about the subject or actually start or resume with meditation. It will be worth it!"

It's been a while since I've start think of meditating and every time I read about all of the positive effects it has and the awareness it can be gained I'm enthusiastic but then I start to overthink. I fear that even if I try to meditate I would never do it right and it would not have any kind of influence on me, so I never commit. Anyone had a similar situation? What helped you overcome this fear? Is it possible to fail meditation?

helpagirloutyall,2021-04-26 18:47:42+00:00,"I used to meditate a lot, but fell out of practice. Now I can’t meditate without immediately slipping into intense visualizations. Any input on this?","I learned transcendental meditation when I was about 18. I kept up with it until I was maybe 21, and then some personal things happened and I lost touch. I have always had intense visualizations, some of them quite disturbing. Once I was meditating in my apartment in college and I kept seeing these scary faces that felt like they were attaching themselves to me and my breathing got shallow. It felt like no matter what I did I couldn’t shake them off. After I had finished the meditation, and after some thought, I attributed it to the fact that things were extremely tense with one of my 2 roommates, and it was all of the stress and anxiety coming out. 

But this is something that happens often and it’s hard to get back into meditating. It feels like whatever is going on in my life comes out strongly in my meditations. I just got through meditating today and I couldn’t even focus because I was picturing this vine wrapping around my neck and constricting my breathing like those faces I saw in college. 

I know this isn’t some weird power I have and that I likely just have a lot of built up stress and anxiety that presents itself to me in these weird ways, but honestly meditating can be a point of greater point of stress than relief for me with these experiences. Even when I try to watch these thoughts like I’m on a lazy river, passing them by, it feels like they attach themselves to me and I can’t escape them. 


Does anyone else have these intense experiences when meditating?"

I'm hoping to look for another method of connecting that will be as effective.

Platyhelminthes88,2021-04-26 17:58:42+00:00,ADHD - trouble meditating,"Hello!

I've been attempting to meditate for many years. I have ADHD. The past 3 months, I've been attempting to meditate for 10-15m a day. Most weeks I end up only meditating 5 or 6 days, but it's been fairly consistent.

The method I've been following is ""sit cross legged, be aware of the breath, and when thoughts come up, just let them go and come back to the breath.""

The problem is, thoughts don't ""come up."" They're simply always there. I don't really have verbal thoughts. I don't ""talk to myself"" in my head in sentences, like ""oh I need to do laundry,"" or ""what should I make for dinner?"" Instead, my mind is mostly dominated by music going through my head. I always, always have music in my head, either actual music or just random stuff my brain is improvising. There are also images always floating around in my mind. My thoughts aren't entirely nonverbal - often I think about imaginary conversations, or conversations I had in the recent past. 

Basically, I'm always daydreaming, and those daydreams have a prominent soundtrack. All the meditation instructions I've read say ""when a thought comes up, let it go and return to the breath,"" but it's not like I have these discrete ""thoughts"" that pop up... it's just constant background noise.

To use an analogy: It's not as if I'm in an empty room and every now and then someone walks into the room and starts talking to me. It's more like I'm in a crowded bar, with music playing and conversations happening all around me. I feel like (keeping with the analogy) meditation instructions make it sound as if the goal is to deal with random people who pop into the room and start talking to you. But how do you deal with an entire crowded, noisy bar?

I've been trying this for a while, and it's always the same thing... Maybe 5% of the time I'll actually be able to keep my attention on the breath, but usually, the background noise - music, images, conversations, etc. - is just overwhelming. I feel like I'm playing tug of war against an entire football team. I finish meditating and feel like I was just daydreaming for 15 minutes, with very occasional moments of mindfulness. I've really been trying for months, with a fairly regular (almost daily) practice, every morning after my shower.

Any advice is appreciated. I know there are alternative types of meditation that I could try, and I will look into those, but I think I'm mostly interested in how to be successful at this particular style of meditation, if that's possible for me.

Thank you!"

Do you. Do whatever works for you in the moment. Practice takes time. It is progress that matters.

I’m not perfect at my practice. I’m new here too and maybe I don’t have the credential to post this as much as the people who’ve been doing this for years but the past couple of months I’ve been attempting to do this have already made so much difference in how I handle the things in my life.

I've got a huge issue with my position. So, the point is, in any place you read about meditation or in any guided meditation, it's said to be in a comfortable position. I usually slouch a lot and I spend most of my days just slouching, so I've decided I'd do laying down meditation. The thing is.. I've fallen asleep twice already by doing so and I'd rather avoid it, to work on my mindfulness.  


I've tried sitting meditation for a couple of times but I end up really frustrated. When I slouch I feel I can breathe easily, but when I sit straight up, as most of the people here and other sources advice, I can barely breathe. It's a really shallow breath and I can barely feel it. Not only I can barely feel it, but I do need to take deeper breaths intentionally as I feel I do not get enough oxygen then.   
It leads me to controlling the breath all the time.   


Not only that, but I'm all the time concerned (when sitting) about my position. My back does hurt after a while of sitting straight and I do not feel stable to the point that I get both irritated by controlling the breath, but also controlling my posture, as I naturally either lean forward or backwards, which adds tension to my abdomen and other parts like legs (sitting cross-legged), which leads to me to focusing on these parts to loosen, but then I slouch again &amp; get irritated.  


How do I stay comfortable but at the same time not fall asleep and keep my clarity of mind, not clouded by lack of mindfulness? It's somehow of a contradiction that I can't get past through."

RedAfroNinja,2021-04-26 13:26:06+00:00,Intriguing thoughts in middle of a session,"So I've been practicing fairly regularly, around 20 minutes each day.  I have a tendency to overthink so mediation was tough at first but I've getting better at focusing on the breath and just noticing the thoughts come in.  One thing I've noticed though is that midway through a session as my mind and body get more relaxed some very intriguing thoughts can pop into my awareness.  These are a lot harder to ignore than the usual regrets and worries about the past and future.  I'm getting better at simply noticing these intriguing thoughts as well but they do have a tendency to make me slip into thinking without realizing it.  My plan is to keep up with the practice and try to just notice the more creative and interesting thoughts that may arise during a session.  I was wondering if anyone has experienced similar things and what they've done about them?"

I normally start out by focusing on my breathing, and then maybe at the 5 minute mark, colors appear in my visual field (eyes closed). Typically purple. I read that these are likely the chakras that are being healed when you meditated, like how purple is the crown Chakra. I don’t know for sure if that’s what it is but I feel like it’s a solid assumption

Anyways so when these color show up they tend to swirl and just move around so my focus starts to be on that instead of my breathing. I honestly think it’s just as good as the breathing since I don’t tend to think to much when I’m watching them dance and this often gets me in to my trace state.

Does anyone else do this? I haven’t done deep research but I don’t think I’ve seen focus practices that mention color so I’m just curious!"

(I had just moved into my grandparents) as I got more into meditation I would fall into like a deep sleep and I would dream of my future sometimes. I could see my self and others but I couldn’t recognize any faces so I never really paid attention to them, except for mine. I eventually forgot about what I saw and it was just a dream until last summer. Last summer i had this most intense feeling of deja vu. I was remembering what I had seen in that state of sleep while meditating. It lasted about 15 minutes, just this continued feeling of the most intense deja vu. I almost didn’t know what to do because I was remembering this happy memory I couldn’t wait for to happen and then it was finally unfolding before my eyes. When I was younger I wanted to be in that moment of happiness so badly because I was in such a sad place. Then I was finally there, I was just in shock that I made it to the place I was safe and happy..... anyone else ever experience anything like this?"

Moon and mind are deeply connected. Practicing this meditation on a full moon day has many powerful benefits for the mind and body.   

🍀The full moon tends to mark a big build-up of energy—both light and dark. This makes it the perfect time to cleanse your space, body and mind; remove or let go of any of that built-up energy you no longer feel like harnessing, capturing or otherwise holding onto. You can use the mantra “let everything that doesn’t belong to me go”—even if just for tonight.   

🍀Many believe the light from the full moon is absolutely perfect for charging and cleansing your crystals. This makes some sense—the full moon is all about bringing our intentions and emotions to the forefront, so we can process them, heal what we need to and ultimately, let go.  

 🍀As you engage in self-reflection, you may notice patterns, behaviors or relationships that aren’t getting you any closer to the life you want. Maybe they’re even detracting from it. Use this full moon as a reminder to let them go—or at least, as an opportunity to contemplate why they’re still there. 

  🌟This Audio Lunar Meditation Includes: Theta Healing Waves, 111Hz music, 528hz, Kundalini Stimulation, 269Hz which corresponds to the Scorpio Zodiac Sign, 210.42HZ which is the frequency of the Moon.   

🌟This full moon will bring some passion to your life and intensity as well as intimacy.The full moon in Scorpio affects all zodiac signs, but Scorpio and Taurus will feel it the most.

lukefromdenver,2021-04-26 12:07:50+00:00,Returning to Flow: Turning the wheels of the chakras by intentional use of regional musculature,"It is important not to put too much pressure into the seeking energetically for the keyhole of the chakra. Using downward force is a dangerous option to use for energy control. The easiest method for accessing lower-region chakra flow is belly-breathing techniques.

One such technique is breathing very low in the abdomen. Feeling the sacral region just above the genitals, and in the area of the back just above the rump and below the lumbar, squeeze in at these areas as though feeling the ripeness of fruit, but do it only by the mind sending the signals to the musculature there. Then, like a bellows, take a breath in this same area by making it open up a space inside you, creating a vacuum filled by energy and air. Then relax and let the charged air exit naturally. 

Then repeat. Slight squeeze in, then expand out drawing air, then relax with an exhale. The slight squeeze in pushes out excess air to come to a total lack of internal air, but we don't want to force anything, we want our body to work with us; we are not trying to discipline it, but seek its participation. 

The same can be done at the lumbar and solar plexus. The upper abdomen muscles, just below the sternum, and the pair of lumbar muscles that display prominently beneath the heart-region, can be clenched, expanded, then relaxed to pump air in, and the particular energies produced by this chakra, combining with to to infuse into and circulate throughout the bloodstream. We're just using a complex machine to achieve physio-psychological balance; this machine must be used or it falls into disrepair, along with the mind. 

Moving back and forth between these two chakras, by pumping them, turning their wheels with continued and focused effort, after *rooting* has occurred (non-violently, and through body awareness brought about by yogic poses [*asana*] and exercise, if necessary) one should be able to produce a warm feeling throughout the abdomen that can be passed into the chest, where it can expand, strengthen, and grow the potency of the heart muscle: *the* pump.

The lower three chakras can be seen like a pyramid, where the square foundation is the base created by our seat, and the peak comes together at the solar plexus, above which sits the all-seeing eye of the heart. The goal is to get into the heart, which causes the emergence of light seen during meditation, and the flows of deep insight and reflection upon the Divine within. Jai gurudev."

Basically was relatively new to the group and never really ever ended up properly fitting in, which is ok, but now I'm stuck in a spot where coworkers are nice to my face but complain about me behind my back and it stings when I overhear it or it gets back to me.

I want to not care as a way of petty vengeance rather than letting it go for my own sake at the moment.

Is my mind finally settling?"
Jax_Gatsby,2021-04-26 10:09:01+00:00,Be indifferent to the mind.,"One of the things (if not the only thing) that makes not just meditation but also life difficult is the mind, or rather identification with the mind. Attention is basically like food to the egoic mind , so the more attention you give it, the more control it has over your emotions, actions and even your behaviour. The mind is meant to be the servant but now it has become the master, this is why people are the way they are; because they are identified with their minds so most (if not all) of their actions and words come from this place of egoic dysfunction, hence so much conflict in relationships and so on.  The ego is by it's very nature selfish, all of it's action is self-centred. You can see this if you spend a day observing the mind, most of the thoughts that come into your mind are about you and what you have to gain or benefit from people and situations. Therefore anybody who is identified with their ego cannot really love, because the ego can't know what love is. It actually gets in the way of love.

So the key is to be indifferent to the mind. [Let go](https://open.spotify.com/track/6tECczt3HwfH9NtCEhOrYb?si=71c9511c808645ba) of the effort to control it and just let it say whatever it wants. This indifference creates a distance between you and your thoughts, which will also make it more clear that you're not your thoughts. Watch the thoughts in the same way you would watch a tv show you have no interest in, because the mind only keeps coming up because of our interest in what it's saying. If you stop giving it attention and showing interest and just watch it in an indifferent way, it will slowly bother you less and less. This is called [the art of watching.](https://open.spotify.com/track/4kuawcP3nvJYDlo6FNwjoO?si=8bd167fded634e45)"

RandomName12358,2021-04-26 10:00:53+00:00,How to stay calm and fall asleep at night with loud neighbors ?,"Hello,

I just started with meditation 2 months ago and I already feel much more relaxed during the day. 

But I still have problem with being relaxed at night when I want to fall asleep. I live in a noisy apartment and I constantly hear noises from the neighbor. It is not very loud but i can here them walk up and down or sometimes it sounds like they are moving furniture. As soon as i hear them i feel how i get restless inside and it feels like adrenalin builds up and my body gets in a fight or flight mode. The more I try to stay calm the more I focus on the noises from the neighbor. 

My biggest problem is that i also have Tinnitus, so i can't fokus on the noises in my head and i always have to focus on something outside my head. So i hear outside noise much louder. I always try to focus on my breething but as soon as i hear my neighbours i focus on their sounds. 

This is a very big problem because even when the sounds of my neighbors stop, my Tinnitus got activated and it is getting louder and louder and it is almost impossible to fall asleep then.

How can meditation help me to get this problem under control ?"

During a very deep trance like meditation, I suddenly felt my head shaking violently from side to side. I then felt something make it’s way up through my body like a surge of energy. Then I saw a brilliant light, like a pure white light, not like sunlight but almost like heavenly white light that was pure all around me. My body was then surrounded by something that was a very deep violet purple, then my body started to disintegrate and my body transformed to what I can only describe as god. I looked like a Hindu god, you know those blue skinned gods in Hindu mythology? I looked like that and I saw some insane creative energy manifest with my own eyes. 

No one believes me but I know for a fact it happened because I’ve done it multiple times now. I’ve been trying to find online anything that’s similar but can’t find anything. When it occurs it feels ancient and sacred for some reason and I genuinely thought I became some sort of god like being. Can anyone explain what’s going on?

I’ve been meditating pretty much every day for the past 2 months or so. It’s been really helpful and I enjoy it. 

I’m curious what type of meditations are out there and which of them you have found to be the most beneficial for really letting go and getting into the flow of energy (hope that makes sense) so as to deeper connect with the essence of yourself and perhaps source itself. Or to truly feel that sense of presence/power of now as Eckhart tolle puts it. 

At this point my go to is to just pop on some reiki music on YT and focus on my breathing and feeling energy moving through the different areas of my body / chakra system. Often times I’ll feel a pulsing/pressure in my third eye area (and most recently a pinpointed hotness - don’t know what that was?) anyways I’ve tried guided meditation, binaural beats, chant in my mind. 

What works best for you guys and any tips/resources that could be beneficial?

richard-romex,2021-04-26 03:10:59+00:00,"possible explanation for some of the ""crazy experiences"".","I have always been an atheist(I still am). I'm a rationalist and only believe in science. I do not follow any religion. In fact I have made fun of religious people a lot in the past and have argued with them many times just because I was an asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started doing meditation about a year ago, I thought it would be just some stress reliever or something. But, it is way much more than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ""crazy experience"" or ""opening third eye"" or ""out of body experience"" are not really something out of this world or something that is way far from our normal experience. The fact that we exist in this moment is ""Magic"". The fact that you are able to read this sentence is ""Magic"". The fact that you have a body which is made up of several things(that we call organs) which allow you to see, touch, move and feel emotions like love, sadness, fear and happiness is ""Magic"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why everything feels too normal to us is because all of this mystery or magic is tiled over with concepts. We have this goggles that we call ego which takes away our power to see the things as they are. The sense of self, ego is product of thought. When you learn to cut through this sense of self, this sense of being in the body, you feel one with the universe. There is no you actually in those moments. There is just experience. There is just universe. There is just this body moving. There are sounds, other beings and you see that you are not in the universe, you are the universe. A lot of these ""out of body"" experiences does not mean there are 2 bodies, one is at ceiling and another is looking down at their another body like you see in movies.

&amp;#x200B;

And I completely understand this sounds crazy, nonsense, alien thing to average person and I honestly do not blame them. If about a year ago, someone had said this to me, I would have told them to go fuck themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying I'm special or unique but maybe not everyone can feel this oneness or maybe they are not willing to take spiritual practice seriously as some other people. One thing that I think is necessary is to keep your mind always open. Keeping your mind open helps you a lot in self-improvement and all other areas of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many people who decide to take psychedelics have this almost same mystical, crazy experience. They come away from these experiences knowing that normal consciousness hides several emotions from us. People also realize that their sense of self may not be accurate. They realize they may not exist the way that have always thought they did. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it is very hard to believe in these experiences unless one has experienced it through meditation or psychedelics themselves at least once. And I also understand some people over-exaggerates and claim to have weird experiences which does not have anything to do with meditation or spirituality. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot of mystical stuff that is real and legit and there is a lot of annoying hippy made-up nonsense stuff. Just because bad stuff is bad does not mean good stuff is not good if that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Love."

Allow room for other opinions, and if it doesn’t serve you, move on.  
  
Love is the way. Compassion is the way. If you see a moment to teach, then instruct with empathy and love. Meditation is a beautiful thing because it draws people from all sorts of backgrounds. Because some have secular beliefs and others nonsecular, it’s important to always respond with understanding and empathy. There’s so much wisdom that everyone brings to the table due to the plethora of reasons that brought everyone here, and it’s important to not gate keep. No one knows everything.

I’ve had friends speak to me about how much they wish they’d started meditating sooner and how great it is for anxiety/stress and i really wanted to give it a go

So here goes i guess! i’m gonna be trying a couple of 10 minute meditations a day and i’ll see what kind of changes happen, i’m really excited to give it a go after seeing some of the posts on here

any tips or things that might help an absolute beginner would be greatly appreciated! i shall check back in 30 days and let everyone know how i find it"

Onthewaytomore,2021-04-25 21:57:55+00:00,Daily meditation uncovering deep feelings?,"Hi guys,

I recently came from abroad, where I really
enjoyed life, worked hard on my business and experienced inner happiness. Since i came back a week go i’ve been going hard on meditation and other positive routines. I’ve been meditating 2-4 times a day and really reaching deeper states. Even though i’ve been eating healthy, doing good routines and meditating a lot, the past few days i’ve been feeling unmotivated to work on my business and a little down/depressed. Not to say very down but i’ve been feeling ‘meh’. Could this be the meditation unlayering deeper emotions from my past which i’m now experiencing in order to let go? I’ve also just surpassed 1.2 years of semen retention which has been great in all aspects BUT it has made me a lone wolf because i’m simply no longer interested in the topics 99% people talk about or engaging in those type of behaviors."

wallstreetentre,2021-04-25 21:04:50+00:00,The simple act of correcting my posture during meditation impacted my whole experience. Also this will help those having difficulty noticing the breath.,"&amp;#x200B;

(**TL:DR -** **at bottom)**

First and foremost , I have to thank this community. I always come here for advice to further my meditation practice and everyone has been really helpful providing tips or insights.

Something I always struggled with was noticing my breathing and having a real steady place to focus. If I focused on my nostrils I would end up controlling my breathing. So then I heard many meditation instructions advise for practitioners to use the abdomen as a place of focus ....except for me I couldn't notice my breathing there either.

I felt stuck and to make things worse my body was telling me I was stressed because I would sigh frequently or take random deep inhalations.

However I remedied all of this by simply changing my posture. I would usually slouch a lot even during meditation but in daily life as well. This impacted my breathing more than I knew. So I set the intention to have a straight/erect posture for my entire 15 minute meditation practice and it was game changing , I was able to feel my breathing throughout  my entire body , I could feel my breathing in my diaphragm , my stomach naturally rising and falling. All this because of simply correcting my posture. 

As someone who's now on their 224th day of straight meditation posture has been the biggest help in regards to allowing my to really notice and concentrate on the breath and having my body naturally breath on its own. I will say at first I was uncomfortable since I slouched all the time but the benefits of feeling my breath clearly outweighed. 

I hope this little piece of advice or insight helps someone else in the way others in this community have helped me. 

&amp;#x200B;

***TL:DR - By changing my posture I was able to detect my breathing in my diaphragm and my whole body which improved my meditation practice.***"

SamathaTRUTH,2021-04-25 20:09:36+00:00,Press into your solar plexus for an intense calming effect.,"The solar plexus is located behind your stomach, under your ribcage (you will feel a bone in there, DO NOT push on that bone, press about an inch under). It's a collection of nerves running together.

This is great to do before meditation or honestly at any time. I suspect it has an effect on the vagus nerve but honestly I don't know, it just works.

1. Press the area described above with a few fingers.
2. Breathe in and let your fingers rise with your belly.
3. As you exhale, you will have much more give, press deeper inside.
4. Repeat this a few times, you can go quite deep and feel the pressure but don't cause yourself pain, that's not the point.
5. Hold like this for a few breaths (allowing your fingers to rise somewhat with the inbreath, but return with the exhale)
6. Once you're finished, don't immediately release the pressure, do it gradually.

Just observe what it does to your state of mind. ;)"

I quit all social media apps recently, and started just laying and contemplating in my room realizing that my life is kinda watching youtube videos all the time even though I have passions.

After some contemplation about a frustrating event I had earlier that day I said to myself ""why not meditate for about 30minutes because I feel kinda uninspired and depressed?"".

And so I did it a litle different this time using i method called do-nothing meditation where you're not allowed to move a muscle and face the discomfort.

I was doing it for about 8 minutes and it was really uncomfortable but I just accepted all itches and discomforts and for a moment everything went blank and i kinda felt like levitating then all of a sudden a wave of strong goosebumps hit me like a truck and I started crying like crazy. I think it was a happy cry, reminding me that this practise is indeed something profound. The idea that I got thoose goosebumps just by sitting in a chair is something mind-boggling to me."

I have been meditating daily for over a year now, and it has helped me massively in terms of my anxiety, depression, and anger. I learned to observe myself slipping into depression, and to see my thoughts and moods as products of my mind, without engaging in them. It has definitely improved my quality of life. But it has made me feel... detached? More nihilistic? I was chasing spirituality and wanted to feel happiness and bliss. Instead, what meditation did is make it clear that I don't have to think thoughts that come into my head, and that I am not even the one producing them, and that they don't matter. And that it good, but I come to this subreddit sometimes to read about experiences that seem close to what one would experience on psychedelics, like the feeling of one-ness with the world. I don't see how what I am doing could get me there...  I guess I am not sure whether I am on the right path anymore. I would really appreciate some guidance, maybe some resources you can link, and also just want to listen to your own experiences."

joestrwrs,2021-04-25 17:41:41+00:00,Discomfort While Meditating,"I’ve been practicing mindfulness-based meditation for a couple of months now. I am using a few apps in my rotation and have mostly been doing 10-20 minute length sessions.

Occasionally, my leg will begin to fall asleep, due to sitting cross-legged. The process has the typical predictable pattern, starting as a slight numbness, numbness increases, then slight pain, and honestly I haven’t really let it get much beyond that. Perhaps when I become more experienced at the practice, it will be an excellent object of mindfulness and good training for finding equanimity through physical or emotional pain, but at this point in my practice it mostly highjacks the session and makes it difficult to follow the breath or anything else. And I’m at the point of practicing where I am learning to observe thoughts without grabbing onto them, so this can add another level of difficulty to that process.

I’ve tried various different ways to sit to try and reduce the occurrence. But so far whenever it has come up, I’ve been acknowledging, noting, and calmly accepting it (at least for the first few minutes) but then mindfully decide to move my leg to alleviate the discomfort. 

I think that when I really try to investigate why it is uncomfortable, and what it truly feels like physically and emotionally, I am able to withstand it a little longer. But it feels like there is a fear of permanent nerve damage or something else (bordering on irrational, perhaps) that ultimately “wins” and gets me to move.

Just wanted to see if anyone else has this or a similar type of experience."

I'm a beginner at meditation, and have been attempting to start with 10 minutes of unguided mindfulness meditation at the start of my day, every day. I've been having some trouble when I attempt this, because I find myself narrating everything internally while I meditate.  


For example, when I try to pay attention to my breathing, internally, my internal monologue will be saying something along the lines of ""Okay, we're breathing in, now out. One breath. Two breaths. Three breaths. What does that feel like? Slight pressure in the chest is we breathe in, slight relief as we breathe out"" and so on.  


I find no matter how much I attempt to focus on the experience, I am unable to stop narrating it, and it feels like a verbal filter keeping me from being present in the moment without taking the involuntary step of putting it into words.  


Does anyone else have any experience with this, or any advice on how to silence that inner monologue?"

Also to meet my spirit inside of me that I can now ground in.  A true blessing and life change.

sowmi245,2021-04-25 14:45:07+00:00,Four Reasons Why You Should Learn To Meditate," ***I know, I can hear you saying it now, ""Why would Meditation Help Me? Isn't Meditation for the Great Eastern Gurus?"" The categorical answer is NO! Every single person on this planet should learn to meditate to help you in your day-to-day growth, to help you cope with the world, and to help you deal with your anxiety.***

**Let me explain ...**

The whole role of meditation is to help find the inner peace that is the art of putting all that chaos in your mind and you live into some sort of order. The first step of meditation is bringing you to a point of calm, a point of peace upon which you can build and manage control. Once you have achieved that you can further explore your own mind. Our mind today often swirls with information, facts, stress, worries, and much more simply because of the way in which we live and the bombardment of information from commercial entities. The role of meditation is to help you find a way of managing that information and to reflect on your surroundings.

**Meditation** will help you to find that point at which you can cope and manage all the bombardments without feeling overwhelmed but that is not the only reason we meditate. Let me outline four reasons why you should consider learning the art of meditation.

**Reason 1 - Meditation Will Assist You In Calming**

One of the core reasons why an individual might learn meditation is to help with their ability to cope with stress and to become calm. One of the roles of meditation is to help release the alpha waves in both our left and right side of our brains. These alpha waves will help bring about a sense of calm, similar to when you would whistle a happy tune or simply daydream.

Learning to **meditate** and bring you to a state of calm will help you cope with the daily stress of life. From personal experience, I have found that if I do not meditate for 20 minutes a day minimum, I find that my ability to cope with the daily stress of work is far harder than when I have completed my meditation.

**Reason 2 - Meditation Can Help You Lower Your Blood Pressure**

I personally have experienced the effect meditation can have on your blood pressure. Many a time I have gone without meditating for a number of days and my blood pressure has slowly crept up. I have done many experiments with my blood pressure and meditation and this is one I encourage you to try. I simply bought an electronic blood pressure machine which you can buy from a pharmacist or chemist for about $200 Australian. I first checked my blood pressure to find out what it currently is. I then did 20 minutes of meditation and checked it again. I found that both my blood pressure and my heart rate had dropped by up to 30%. I have also tried doing the same exercise but instead of meditating, I just sit for 20 minutes and relaxing but I have found I do not get anywhere near the same improvement. Generally, I would only see about 5 to 10% improvements.

I have seen many research documentaries that have illustrated in a practical way how simply using basic meditation techniques can decrease your blood pressure and your heart rate. Visit your local library and check out the books and research they have on meditation. You will be surprised how many doctors now encourage their patients to learn meditation. My GP (General Practitioner) and his wife actually run guided courses on meditation.

**Reason 3 - Meditation Can Help With Creativity**

There is a lot of who do about meditation and a lot of people call themselves meditation experts. Honestly, I do not buy into that for one simple reason. Meditation is about you. When you are meditating there will be no one else in your head except for you, so in the end, you are the expert on your own meditation techniques. However, I will say that there are many people who can help you in learning meditation but ultimately, if you are listening to them while you are meditating you are not focusing on your inner self but on your outer self.

I have been told that I am one of the most prolific writers out there. It is normal for me to sit down in the morning and by the afternoon I will have belted out 5 to 10 articles of 1,000 to 2,000 words and my editors would not print my material if it was not of excellent quality. One of the reasons I believe I am able to achieve this is because of my meditation regime. When I have completed my meditation, my mind is free of stress which really opens my creativity. I just like many writers suffer, what we like to call, ""Writers' block"". Often this is caused simply because of the chaos of the information in our head.

If I have a situation where writer's block is really setting in, I simply stop, head to my meditation area for 20 minutes, and once I am finished, I will always have a swirl of great ideas to complete my material. One thing to note though, I have found that Baroque Music at 60 beats a minute, works best for getting that creativity flowing. I prefer this style of meditation music, over tranquil water flowing or the sounds of the open bush simply because the 60 beats a minute, helps release far more alpha waves in my brain.

To give you an idea of how powerful Baroque Meditation music at 60 beats a minute can be, the Coca-Cola Retail Research Council found that relaxed customers would in fact purchase 38% more than those who were not relaxed.

[Click here to see our free meditation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH3B8CNUE9I)

**Reason 4 - Meditation Can Help With Learning**

If meditation can help with creativity then it also stands to reason that mediation music can help with learning. In particular Baroque Meditation, music makes the perfect background for all training and learning environments from pre-school to government ""think tanks."" In fact, it is used in schools all over Australia. A quote from the teacher of a remedial class here in Australia: ""It seems to slow them down so they can think.""  
Corporate trainers can improve the effectiveness of training sessions dramatically. A colleague uses baroque meditation music as a background for his memory. In fact, I have been using Baroque Meditation Music in some of our computer sessions and I have seen dramatic improvements in the way people cope with our technical training.  
Look, the days of meditation being only for the hippies or eastern religions like Buddhism are over. Anyone who has ever tried meditation will tell you that you certainly will feel a sense of calm and as you become more proficient you will find your ability to copy, be creative and learn more will be improved. The challenge that most people fear with meditation is that they will look foolish or their peers might think less of you but in all honesty, you may be surprised to find out that the people you think will look at you as foolish are in fact the ones using meditation daily."

utiputigen,2021-04-25 14:19:17+00:00,Is the “goal” of meditation to integrate objectless awareness (awareness of awareness) into everyday experience?,"I’m a little lost because if yes how do you listen to what others say, watch movies, read books if you’re being aware of the subject (that, which is aware) instead of objects. Thank you guys in advance 🙏🏽

Edit: It’s just when I am aware of awareness I feel imperturbable peace but once I focus on an external object, that peace wavers, and it seems like I can only set aside time to feel peaceful instead of carrying the quality into every experience. (It’s like I have to ignore any object to feel that peace: a thought, a person talking to me, a movie on the screen. Once I focus, though — thoughts come rushing in)

Makes me wonder what the difference is between an enlightened person, and one who isn’t (in terms of their attention, for example)?"

I have severe anxiety which I'm currently on medication for, sertraline/zoloft.  I was browsing the other day when I came across something about Ray Dalio and TM meditation.  I looked into it further, am reading the book. 

I have tried meditating before but the focus on breath thing makes me feel way more anxious. I've done this TM one the past couple of days, yesterday I noticed I had more energy and felt more positive which is amazing.

However, I was reading Bob Roth book last night when I read that you're not supposed to just sit and repeat your mantra in your head? Which is what I've been doing. I'm not exactly sure what to actually do? Or if I'm doing it right?

Can anyone help me out a bit? 

Thanks so much :)"

Essah01,2021-04-25 10:39:55+00:00,Half Lotus or Full Lotus with half of the time spend in the Meditation? Any Tips?,"Hello everyone, so I am doing longer sessions like 45 minutes in Half Lotus and feel pretty comfortable with it and I thought I would take it to next step to the Full Lotus.
There were some issues I encountered. First of all flexibility wise I can hold it for a bit like 22 minutes only with my left feet up first in the position and then my right feet over left leg. So I can not really do it when I try to put my right feet in position first and then my left one. I guess flexibility wise I need too stretch more.
Aside from that after a while my feet slips from the position. 
Also I feel like I tense up in the legs more than usual to hold the position.
I use some blanket as a cushion btw. .

In contrast I feel the half Lotus is pretty comfortable and I can hold the position for longer.

Now I wonder which may be more beneficial.

Im guessing that the Full Lotus take some practise and time. I was thinking about doing both. 

So what are your guys take on this? And how did you progress?

I for myself do some stretching to open the hips more and more."

i have this condition called paruresis which basically means i have a shy bladder and can’t pee when people are around me. doesn’t matter if i’m at home or not, my body shuts down as soon as i’m on the toilet. now, in my daily life i hear a lot of stuff like “have you tried exposure therapy?” or “you just pee, it’s not that hard. just think differently” or “have you tried changing your thought patterns through cognitive behavior therapy?”. i get it, it’s a very basic human thing to do, peeing. so, i understand why it’s hard for people to really get this problem. but you can understand it sometimes makes me feel like my problem is really dumb, but in reality it’s pretty serious and i just want answers :’(

this is what happens. there’s is a fear of going to the toilet and i can’t pee. there are thoughts accompanying that emotion. then there’s the physical part which is the tension through my whole body that shuts down the process of peeing. these three things are connected which makes it a complex thingy. i’ve tried so much exposure, but because there’s a physical component it’s hard to change your way of thinking and control your body in that way. i’m familiar with ways to let go of emotions and integrate them, different techniques etcetera. i’ve grown so so much the past year because of that, but the shy bladder is still there. i know it’s ok to sit on the toilet longer then others, it’s ok if they hear me pee, but it’s the tension i can’t seem to release.. 

i feel motivated to do anything that could lead me to healing! maybe there’s someone out there with same experiences or someone that knows some alternative healing that could work. so please every tip is welcome (except “you should try exposure therapy” because then you just don’t understand this problem :p )

thank you for putting the effort in reading this and maybe giving me some advice! i appreciate you all &lt;3"

**Is the Law of Attraction Real? (And How Do I Make It Work?)**

Can you really get rich using the law of attraction? What is LOA?

The “law of attraction” is frequently abbreviated to LOA and the “law of attraction” is very real. There have been countless people who have made themselves rich using the LOA.

The Law of Attraction was first popularized in the book “Think and Grow Rich,” by new thought author, Napoleon Hill about the idea that anyone can become rich if they first, mindfully think in a positive and specific way. The essential plausibility of the law of attraction is the same as the central thesis of all religions. Belief. Essentially, it is about the action of belief.

 

How to make the LOA work for you Hold that good-feeling belief space in your mind and body, so that it is the only vibration you are generating. Like attracts like. Every thought has a frequency. If you are thinking a thought over and over again you are emitting that frequency.

The brain produces electrical activity from the ion currents flowing among neurons during synaptic transmission (thinking), and in accordance with Maxwell’s equations, any electric current produces a magnetic field. Your thoughts are magnetic.

When you use the LOA you are tapping in the field of possibility which exists in one of the folded dimensions inside our own. By holding the feeling and vibration of what you want to manifest you are essentially pulling it out of the field of possibility into the one in which you exist, physically. Of course, what you want to manifest doesn’t (usually) pop up into existence like a miracle. It works its way into your life in a seemingly organic way.

I can’t tell you how many times I have manifested large amounts of money for myself using these techniques. I don’t care if there are doubters. You can doubt all you want. Just move along then, nothing to see here.

But for those of you who instinctively know what I’m saying is true and are reading this to strengthen your own belief, then BELIEVE. Because it is the action of the BELIEF in the FEELING of the belief that causes you to manifest. Maybe, the Universe sent you this little gift of knowledge and remembering today, to help you stay on track.

The LOA is real but is poorly understood

You are creating and holding “feelings” in your body and mind when you practice LOA. These feelings need to come from a place of internal peace and power. If you are feeling grasping or panicky you are not in the right headspace. This takes a lot of work, learning how to clear and center yourself properly.

For best results, try not to manifest “things.” Instead, manifest “feelings.”

For example, you may want a lot of money because of the desire for freedom or security. There are many paths to freedom and security, and money generally has a lot of mental baggage and feelings of unworthiness attached to it, so that may not be the ideal way of manifesting those feelings.

Ironically, focusing on needing and hoarding a large amount of money is a lack mentality. This is called the world of hungry ghosts. You are objectifying money and giving it too much power and importance in your life. What you probably want instead is to be freed from money restricting you in some way. Feel and imagine a great amount of money flowing to you. Imagine yourself feeling happy, satisfied, and at peace as you receive a large amount of money.

Creating the feeling and vibration of freedom and flexibility to do what you want in life, is better. Holding this space for yourself is key. It is a very different vibe than a vibe of acquiring the money which can be based on a feeling of grasping want.

**The LOA also has limitations**

If the vibration you put out is getting a lot of interference patterns from the people around you, it will not work as well as it could. If you want to manifest something, be sure not to share your desire and goal with someone who is not completely supportive. It’s a strange occurrence when you begin to shift your energy, sometime the people in your life will react badly. That is because on some level, the people in your life can feel your change and it triggers deep fears about themselves. They want you to stay the same so that they feel comfortable.

Spend your day constantly reminding yourself to take a deep breath and centering yourself. Imagine yourself in a cocoon of white golden light of protection. Learn how to ground your energy. From this space, you can begin your manifestations with the LOA.

Be mindful of limiting your exposure to negative people and places, including social media. This will drain you and your ability to manifest faster than anything.

**Take a deep breath. Do it right now.**

Visualize you are surrounded by white golden light. Breath this golden-white light through the center of your body and feel it expand to a cocoon. Focus on clearing all negativity from your energy. Let the golden-white light energy wash away all negativity. Now, from THIS space, visualize what you want to achieve.

Now I don't understand how to play the game.,"I had an experience once that was life changing.  Eye opening.  According to Daniel Ingram I crossed the arising and passing away.  I had a spiritual psychosis, an emergent crisis, a shamanic awakening, bipolar mania mixed with mindfulness to produce a profound meditative state.  It took me a year to realize it was a real thing I went through, and not ""just some psychosis.""  

I'm just saying, I get it.  I get the implications of meditation.  I get what it can do for serenity and presence.  As far as I understand, I've had one of the more profound meditative experiences a person can have.  And it's fucking torturous.  Because I don't actually know how to meditate.  I'll yell ""fuck off"" after under a minute of sitting. 

What's worse, the worst, is that I have expectations.  I don't know how to let go of expectations.  I can't just sit for the sake of sitting without longing for blasting off into Christville.  This will probably be downvoted immediately and my feelings will be hurt and I'll delete it.  I just feel so lost and fucking helpless.

KundalinirRZA,2021-04-24 22:46:00+00:00,"No matter the location, most cultures have recognized the sun as the prime controller of all life on Earth because without it, life here could not exist.","
As the Earth rotates daily on its axis, every morning the sun brings light to the darkness, warmth and comfort to the chill of night, photo synthesis to plants, and security to humans. 

It's for this reason that as far back as 14,000 8.C.E., adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cave walls. Countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Mayans and the Aztecs, and the Australian Aborigines, to name just a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source of enlightenment, illumination, and wisdom. 

While the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on Earth because the Earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields.

On a grand scale, it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between the sun's energy, the Earth's energy, and the energy of all living species. On a micro level, all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit or vegetable to understand this interdependence. 

Consciously absorbing that energy to combine with your own Spiritual Energy has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more.

Your spiritual energy goes under many different names like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.

Here's a 3 minute [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/uKdiTTbWbIA) expanding more on the benefits and how to, actually absorb the energy from the sun, through your own self-induced voluntary goosebumps from positive events/thoughts/memories/feelings."

Fruitblood-,2021-04-24 22:33:06+00:00,Seeing through my eyelids.,"Hello. I’m a m(26) who recently began mediation and had an intense experience. 

As a preface I’ll say that i live with bpd and severe depression. 
My doctor recommended that I try to mediate and suggested a few resources. 

Amongst those he recommended reading the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh. 
I have a very active mind and mediation is something I’ve failed to understand and I’ve been extremely close minded towards it until recently. 

A few nights ago I decided to go to bed early to be well rested and to have an opportunity to begin reading. 
After smoking a bowl I decided to read the first ten or so pages of “How to Relax” by T.N.H. 

It guided me through a few breathing exercises and had a few allegorical poems. After about ten minutes of reading I decided to close my eyes while sitting on my bed. Focused on my breath while reciting:

“breath In. I am breathing in. Breathe out. I am breathing out”

After about ten minutes or so I felt relaxed and decided to lay down and go to sleep. 
I shut all of my lights off and began to try and sleep.
Mind you I wasn’t exhausted. Completely conscious and still bouncing a few thoughts around my head. I opened my eyes and decided to look at my stationary clock for the time. 

After 2 or so minutes I began to see a faint light with my eyes closed. I moved my hand to my face to brush hair away and noticed that I could see the difference in light with my hand in front of my face. 

I opened my eyes again  briefly to look at my clock. Assuming that the faint light from it was making my eyes sensitive. 

I closed my eyes again and waved my arm in front of my closed eyes. 

Almost at once, most of the objects in my room, and my arms were somewhat visible with my eyes closed. 
The shapes of objects in my room were rough and losing form. However my arms appeared in full but covered in a black shadow. 

I assumed that at the angle I was laying, my eyes were partially open. So I held my eyelids closed with one hand and with the other kept waving and could still see shapes and my arms. 

A white light appeared in front of me and I reached out to it. 

It disappeared and turned into a black figure that was shaped vaguely like a human. 

(This is all in A minute or two window. ) 

In the past I’ve been known to have extremely vivid flashing visuals when trying to sleep. Usually stressful or gory imagery (stress related). 
I was scared and opened my eyes. Immediately I turned to my phone and googled “seeing through my eyelids”. 

At the time I hadn’t related it to mediation whatsoever. But every search result was about meditation. 

I teared up immediately. Didn’t know the true power of meditation. I rushed to my living room to tell my brother who of course asked if I was intoxicated or having “sleep paralysis”

I have a long history with sleep paralysis but this was nothing like it. I was totally conscious of my mind and body. Nowhere near sleep. 

Please tell me if you’ve had a similar experience. 
I know it sounds out there but I’m recalling it exactly as it happened. 

Much love"

peaceiseverystepp,2021-04-24 17:16:02+00:00,Happiness can feel like it's outside our control - but you have more influence than you realise,"The four noble truths of the Buddha are simple to express: suffering is part of life, but happiness is possible and we make choices in every moment that lead us to happiness / suffering. The reason its revolutionary is that it paints a picture where our happiness isn’t an external factor that's outside of our control, it’s something that’s within our reach with some practice, some patience and some persistence.

Which is not to say that you should beat yourself up for not being happy - its as important to practice non-judgement for yourself as for others, because every person you see if doing the best they can given their circumstances, including you.

So how do we train ourselves to be happy? The first step is to focus on the positive.  This might not be where our minds go automatically - humans have a natural negativity bias, a leftover from our our evolution where we’re more focused on where there might be wolves than where there’s flowers. This is completely understandable as it kept us alive for thousands of years but its something we need to be aware of when living our modern lives. Social media is very focused on the negative because that’s what grabs our attention. Research shows that consuming any kind of media that is mostly negative affects our mental health. So we need to be careful what we consume.

We can also make a choice in every moment to focus on the good things we have and be grateful for them rather than seeing what we don’t have or what’s wrong. This takes time and patience as we might be very used to focusing on the negative. I live in Britain and we love to have a moan, especially about the weather but it’s within our gift to appreciate the great things that are all around and regularly meditate on them or capture them in a gratitude journal. On the flip side can notice our judgmental thoughts arise, listen to them without getting involved or judging and watch them pass without acting on them. This is how we train ourselves to focus on the positive.

The second step is smiling to your difficulties. This sounds absolutely crazy - why would you want to smile when things are difficult? There's two reasons - the first is neurological. When you smile, even if you don’;t feel like smiling, your brain releases chemicals which reduce stress and lift your mood - so its a very easy way to change how you’re feeling. That's why we gently smile while we meditate.

The other way smiling helps is that it reduces the power those difficulties have over you in your mind. When we see anger, anxiety and sadness as our enemies that rob us of our peace then (naturally) we’re afraid of them - we try and block out the thoughts and we run to consumption to help us out, which of course never works in the long term. When we smile to our difficulties, our difficult emotions and say, “there you are, my old friend”, we accept what we’re feeling without judgement, we reduce our suffering.

DavenKyu,2021-04-24 16:06:10+00:00,I have a problem with Samatha and Vipassana.,"I tried Samatha: Focusing only in my breathing. But that's not for me. When I try to do this, I start to fight everything that arises (thoughts, sensations, emotions, etc) and the meditation turns into a struggle and I end up frustrated, feeling worse.

What I usually do is called Vipassana/Mindfulness: focusing on my breathing until something arises (thoughts, feelings, emotions, sensations, perceptions, anything). The problem with this is that when that happens I feel my attention is splitted, because or I pay attention to my breathing or to my thoughts. I can't pay focused attention to two things at the same time, right?"

AcharyaPrashant_,2021-04-24 15:04:05+00:00,Beware of the cult of mindfulness,"Spirituality is the transcendence of consciousness. Spirituality is to see that all elements of consciousness are in the same dimension and are not to be taken seriously.

Mindfulness makes you take everything seriously. Even a simple act like walking is now being taken very seriously. Spirituality gives you the freedom to fly in abandon, fly without any mindfulness, zero mindfulness. What is happening, is just happening. I don’t need to be mindful.

Isn't mindfulness such a curse, such a burden?"

sml930711,2021-04-24 14:16:09+00:00,switched to Zazen from Vipassana,"Sitting, facing wall, eyes open pointed downwards, and no object which is the Soto Zen approach of “Shikantaza” (just sitting)

Hard to explain why but it feels like a better fit. I tend to overthink and that extends into overthinking “insight”, even though both probably lead to the same thing at the end
but simply a different approach

Intro level meditations may start the same, as both may be introduced to beginners to focus on breathing. 

I have only went to one Soto Zen introductory class and taken nothing formally on Vipassana. I just did guided meditations and listening to monks for a Theravada-based approach to mindfulness for a while before gaining a fascination for Zen, so I am no expert on either."

It was a beautiful and powerful feeling, but in a loving God powerful way. It was as if the vibration testified and confirmed ""I am"".

lukefromdenver,2021-04-24 13:25:51+00:00,"I worked 11 hours yesterday on my fast-day, came home and crashed, didn't meditate, and was unhappy.","When I break my good life pattern (which is healthy for the mind once in a while) I am always headed for some kind of discomfort, merely psychological in nature (it's not real, it's like you've forgotten something and don't know what it is). This causes an undercurrent of fear to crop up that might at first be registered as an agitation, but then rebounds as a gripping dread, maybe associated with a specific thing or event one anticipates in the future.

Of course, this sort of thing can't be sustained by the system for long; it's unhealthy at a certain point, and sleep is a good remedy. There is no positive physiological reaction occurring as a result of this sort of mind, and thus it is not caused by any defect in practice; it is scattering of the mind's potency. Having a couple decades of practice at this point, I can say, again, it's psychological in nature, arising from a combination of fatigue and general mental overload; though there may be components of the fear grounded in reality, the mind is projecting something additional into the memories of the day causing misapprehension. 

In life, among non-meditators, there is no remedy but rest and time. But for the meditator, we have a way of reorienting ourselves. By emptying the mind, connecting to our physical body, regaining balance throughout our systems regulated by breath and the enhanced flow of blood and awareness through the nerves, and by mentally connecting with centers along the spine which direct flows in specific regions of the body—simply by our being aware of them—we can very quickly rebound and reconnect to our source in the heart, which then opens the door to the higher centers of cognition (energy), understanding (bliss), and then peace (connection with God). 

For me (and everyone is wired a bit different) I wake up and feel like an astronaut. It's a disconnection from my body, and almost a numbness throughout—a weightlessness—though it's uncomfortable. I've learned that before I even get out of bed I should say a prayer and try to connect to my toes. I begin my process of rooting straightaway; flexing muscles throughout my legs, and finding each muscle in my *perineum*, which I will link instead of describe.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum

The root, or lowest, *chakra* (which is condensed energy or awareness arising at a particular point along the spineal column), called *muladhara* in Sanskrit, is often described as being the anus, and perhaps that is true, but to me I register it as an awareness throughout the region. 'Opening' a chakra is registered as *flow*. Increased flow causes organs in the region to cycle through their functions with ease. The return of awareness causes a kind of enjoyment, a blissful rather than disturbed awareness of the body arises, progressively moving up the tree from the roots."

PeddoPedro,2021-04-24 11:51:04+00:00,Meditating for dummies?,"Hello!

I recently finished a book about a guy that quit his career to live as a monk in the woods for 17 years, hearing his story has really inspired me to pick up the habit of meditating. I have always been fascinated by it and have been thinking it's something that would benefit me, but I have not put it to practice.

The last 2 days however I have started to meditate for a few minutes before bed, I'm not really sure if I'm doing it right though so I have a few questions.

Is the goal always to not think of anything? For example if I'm having some actual deep and meaningful thoughts, am I supposed to steer clear of them and focus on my breathing or is it ok to think while I meditate?

Is it important how I breathe? I usually breathe in with my nose and out with my mouth.

Is my pose for sitting down important? Can I sit in my couch with support for my back while I meditate or is it better to sit up straight on the floor? 

How many times a day do you meditate and for how long do you so it?

Thank you for any answers!"

The_Light_Bender,2021-04-24 10:45:38+00:00,THE PATH OF ASCENSION,"THE PATH OF ASCENSION

Our Ascension may be one of the most important things in our lives. 

Our soul’s progression back towards the Oneness of God is the entire reason any of us are alive today. 

Ascensions flow through cycles of construction and deconstruction. This is a sacred process of building strong energetic foundations in order to sustain higher frequency existence. 

Unresolved issues can completely derail enlightenment when enough energy is coursing through your body. It is a known issue for people to abuse newfound power. It is the reason why it is so vital that ancient karmic ties and deep subconscious conditioning be unraveled before exploding us in light. 

The process may seem dark and scary at times. The Universe continues along a destined pathway that ultimately ascends as Unconditional Love. 

Through hundreds of lifetimes on this planet, we are becoming consciously aware of the evolution of the very fabric of our being. We are vibrating higher. People are awakening from a deep slumber. 

There are a lot of predators awaiting this event. Ascending souls are like little baby turtles scuttling towards the safety of the ocean. 

There is a powerful momentum behind everything that is happening in your life. 

When you go through the necessary healing and align with the currents of the Universe, you follow a pathway of no resistance. Acceptance is key. Spiritual integrity is a moral compass that spins around based upon underlying intentions. 

Don’t ever forget why you came here or what most resonates with the ascension of your soul. 

You are a conscious fragment of God.  An immortal multi-dimensional Being of Light, having a temporary human experience.

You are the love of this and every universe.

I was doing my usual meditation but decided to change up the scenery so went to a different room and sat on a comfy couch instead of with the window open at about 2 am (i know weird timing haha). Anyway towards the end of my meditation at like 40mins, I started to see a blue circle that would go in and out with my breath. kinda like how you can see the sunlight through closed eyes. Anyway, at this point, I was in a very deep state which I haven't been in months id say but thought it was interesting nonetheless. My guess is it's the mind's best try at making stuff interesting haha."
f1lt3r,2021-04-23 21:44:26+00:00,Extremely Intense Meditation,"Last weekend I had an extremely intense meditation experience, which has left me asking some serious questions:  


1. Is it definitely safe to meditate on your own? (Nothing about this is ever mentioned in the Headspace app I use).
2. Has anyone ever been physically impaired, or even died from meditating?
3. If I get very intense experiences, should I stop meditating or keep going?  


Thanks in advance!  


Details:

* Seeing lights (eyes closed in a room with no distraction).
* Breathing slowed down dramatically. Almost felt like I was not breathing. But not lightheaded at all.
* Started to notice ""glitches"" popping all over my body. (Hard to describe, maybe nerve endings?)
* Turning waves of light, accompanied by an electric feeling.
* All of a sudden, I was hovering over tendrils of light. Distinct feeling of being somewhere else.
* Opened my eyes and the room seemed like it was in a tunnel for about 30 seconds.
* Me, sitting there saying ""Woah, WTF just happened?!"" for about 3 mins.
* Walking home for 2 miles, it felt like there was no direction (no up/down/left/right), and I couldn't tell if I was walking straight or wobbling all over the place."

HeadNshoulders77,2021-04-23 21:00:43+00:00,Panic while driving,"Hello Reddit, and thank you to whoever is reading this. I have hesitated to post this because I do not want to energize this thought any more than I already have and reinforce the idea of a separate ""self"" that is fearful. But I need help. I have been meditating seriously for a year (20-30 minutes) and initially discovered it while ""battling"" with panic disorder. I was having panic attacks several times per day, triggered only by driving on the highway. Through meditation and learning more about attacks, I was able to go back to driving to school every day (30 minutes away) and was pretty much back to normal. However, because of covid starting last year and the lockdowns I no longer drive to school or work, allowing me to be at home all day just working on school stuff. Because of no driving, my panic and anxiety towards the expressway have slowly intensified and again I find myself barely able to be at a stoplight, let alone driving for a while on the highway. I realize the impermanence of anxiety and panic and understand that these attacks can't hurt me, but that fear is so intense especially because I am driving simultaneously. 

I have tried several times to get on the highway and have either gone on and got off at the next exit or just no get on at all. I don't really have a reason to drive because of the pandemic, so the only reason I get on the road is to ""get over"" my fear. When I fail and am not able to make any progress thoughts of guilt and shame about how I'm a loser arise, and I've been getting better at observing those and letting them go. At this point, it may be the fear of fear that is worse than the actual panic, but both scare the shit out of me. I can handle a panic attack anywhere else, but on the highway, it seems impossible while driving a vehicle at high speeds and I don't know how I did it the first time. I'm sorry if this is incoherent as it's difficult to talk about. Any advice or stories from personal experience with this are greatly appreciated. For now, I will continue to meditate and observe as much as possible."

Morc-Glork,2021-04-23 17:31:38+00:00,Can meditation help me build a stronger mind?,"Hello, everyone. Recently I’ve had very intrusive and anxiety ridden thoughts that have really been effecting my life, and after diving in a little deeper, seeing therapists and psychiatrists, I have been diagnosed with a very mild form of OCD. After looking back on life, I’ve always had this. There’s never been an extended period of time where I didn’t have these type of obsessive thoughts, and they’re all very irrational as well. It’s been quite treatable in the past few months. I have sought out cognitive behavioral therapy which has helped a lot, I’ve tried a few different anxiety medications and I think I found the right one, I’ve been reading books by anxiety experts, and have been using some buddhist methods of replacement thoughts to help as well. I of course have flare ups of anxiety and obsessive thoughts, but I know one day I’ll be able to move on from them since in such a short time I have been able to deal with, and move past them. 

I wanted to know if meditation could help me as well, and if so what are the steps I have to take to start? This may seem like a silly question to you guys, but I’m seriously brand new to meditation.

Any response is appreciated"
AcharyaPrashant_,2021-04-23 17:23:00+00:00,The real meaning of meditation,"निःसङ्गो निष्क्रियोऽसि त्वं  स्वप्रकाशो  निरञ्जनः।  
अयमेव हि ते बन्धः समाधिमनुतिष्ठसि।

You are now and forever free, luminous, transparent and still. The practice of meditation keeps one in bondage.

**\~ Ashtavakra Gita (Chapter 1, Verse 15)**  


Ashtavakra is saying that the practice of meditation keeps one in bondage. Why is he saying that? Because the method or technique for meditation cannot come through knowledge. Meditation surely does require a technique because it is the mind that ultimately relaxes, settles, and disappears into meditation. Mind moves only on techniques, so techniques are needed. On the one hand, techniques are needed; on the other hand, as Ashtavakra says, the practice of meditation keeps one in bondage. What is this contradiction? The contradiction is that the technique for meditation too can be known only in meditation. It is your meditation, it is your meditativeness which will automatically, from nowhere, reasonlessly tell you the right technique suited to you and that technique cannot come from anywhere else. No book can tell it to you, no amount of thinking and planning and analyzing can tell it to you. You will just know.

When you are meditative, then you will also know how to live in a meditative way. Living in a meditative way, this itself is the technique for meditation. You will know whom to talk to, you will know what to read, you will know whom to avoid and whom to come close to; you will simply know. The technique itself opens up when you are there. Otherwise, the technique will not be known to you. Otherwise, you will have all these borrowed practices of meditation which are of very little help. What is happening here right now? We are talking about meditation, but even these words about meditation will be meaningful to you only if you are meditative. Only in your meditativeness can you understand these words about meditation. “What is the significance of these words if I already have to be meditative?” It is the words that are bringing you to meditation. “Where are these words coming from?” They are coming from meditation itself. “Then what is the source of all this?” Meditate and you will know.

It is not a crude and linear cause-effect diagram. Do not come up with your chicken and egg story – What comes first, meditation or technique for meditation? Thought will not be able to understand all this. You understand what I say because you are meditative, and you are meditative because I say what I say. What comes first? Meditate. “What does meditation mean?” To throw away this stupid question. When you throw away this stupid question, then you realize that meditation is sufficient. The answer to this question anyway does not matter. What will you do with the answer to this question? You will try to capture it. You will try to do some kind of mischief with it. What else will you do?"
SamathaTRUTH,2021-04-23 17:18:49+00:00,"Enter ""jewel mirror samadhi"" any time, anywhere.","Following people's kind recommendations, I'm making my way through ""Hidden Zen"" by Meido Moore and I've decided to share with this community the knowledge I find indispensable on the path to enlightenment.

""Jewel mirror samadhi"" is a Zen term, illustrating the reflective quality of the mind and the impermanence of both inner and outer experience. Samadhi specifically means something like focused meditative absorption/sustained peace.

The benefits of this practice are of course awakening to the true nature of reality, but also peace that does not depend on conditions.

Instructions are as follows:

1. Looking ahead with a soft focus, engage your peripheral vision as well and take in your entire field of sight. This already reduces rumination/inner monologue and is a great start.

2. Notice the changes in your field of sight (e.g. rustling of leaves, cars passing by), but don't get attached to anything in particular. Let things come and go, arise and pass away. This is the nature of the world.

3. Allow your field of vision to encompass the source of your seeing as well. Notice that there is no separation between the inner world and the outer world, the seer and the seen. There is just ""seeing""/there is ""no seeing"". The currently observed, ever changing phenomena are what make up your conscious experience (hence the ""jewel mirror"").

4. This of course sheds light on what is meant by the self being an illusion. There is no self, just a similarly ever changing process made up of thoughts and feelings arising and passing away. The observer cannot be separated from the observed, the two only exist in relationship to each other.

5. With sufficient understanding and practice, this method can of course be expanded to include all things heard, felt, smelled and even thought of as well. All senses.

The words of the Heart Sutra ring true:
""Listen Sariputra,
all phenomena bear the mark of Emptiness;
their true nature is the nature of
no Birth no Death,
no Being no Non-being,
no Defilement no Purity,
no Increasing no Decreasing."""

What is the sound of an exhale and it's accompanying inhale that we hear in our heads? Can we use that sound to escape awareness?

There's a mantra for the sound of that breath cycle and it just happens to be the Original Mantra. Unfortunately, too many of us came to know this mantra as ""Om"", when ""Aum"" would have been less incorrect but, in the end, still hopelessly inefficient.

As a result a tumult of well-meaning embellishment, invention and personalization has taken place. 

Used correctly, the Original Mantra is so perfect for meditation that it's preposterously easy to explain how it works.

I know that the question sounds ridiculous, but i remember since being a kid i always had this problem even in sports session at school, ""straighten your back, keep your shoulders aligned with your butt"" just doesn't compute easily from formal language to a physical understanding for me, a teacher would try to help for an instance or too, but then i'll keep back to either 1 : ) doing it wrong 2 : ) Wondering if i'm actually doing it wrong and just harming my muscles/back whatever which just creates a new anxiety.

For instance in meditation, when i try to ""straighten my back"" i feel i'm either falling on a side or another, it's not the pain or uncomfort that bother me, but that there is no stability.

I'm just wondering for people who had a similar problem, how did you solve it ? How do you know you are sitting straight or not etc, do you rely exclusively in the comfort ? So that a comfortable position is always a reliable position ?

A little background; I have had a host of quite serious mental health problems &amp; a history of being in abusive environments for most of my life. I'm finally in a place where I'm loved &amp; safe &amp; my meditation practice is genuinely changing my life. I've always had an issue with a filter in terms of what comes out if my mouth, but now I'm finding I'm speaking much less. The thoughts bubble up &amp; then I'm just able to let them go. I have always had a huge problem concentrating. Now I can sit for hours painting (I'm an aspiring artist) with no problems. I also had an issue with my sex drive, mostly because I was so depressed, and also the history of abuse. Now it's like my body and heart have been liberated and I can connect with my partner like we did at the beginning of our relationship again. 

The world is beginning to look beautiful beyond words, I'm so grateful for everything I have &amp; I'm able to approach my vices and shortcomings with a balanced mind, rather than by breaking down like I used to. After so many years of wishing I was dead, I am finally able to just enjoy existing.

In school I was very quiet, I went to school every day just hoping someone would socialize with me and be my friend. I didnt know it was a possibility that I could interact with others. I probably have had social anxiety in the past, but now I can do basic adult things without really worrying. I don't think I'm wearing the real me. I'm terrified what others think of me. I feel so constrained by something mental. Ego? I want to be able to have conversations with people and make jokes and have fun but It doesn't seem to come naturally. I am a quiet, monotone, predictable, guy. I want to let go and be expressive and vibrant. If anyone has advice for me I'll gladly hear it. Thanks!"

This is not a pro or anti statement about drugs.

My point is, drugs are sorta irrelevant in the face of vipassana.

I suppose all varieties of ""world"" are likewise irrelevant.

Yes, talk is cheap. Can I swallow serious pain? Death? A really heavy psychedelic experience?

Maybe.

At least I've discovered why I make sacrifices for others at all. It's the same reason people sacrifice their lives for their country: To maintain the platform of freedom and peace that was built by our ancestors. I have reaped the fields that they painstakingly sowed. In light of this realization, I feel inspired to plant new seeds for future generations. Humanity has come a long way as we are nearing the end of the Era of War. What a bright future we have after the scars of war, built up over thousands of generations, are fully healed. I selfishly desire to see the result myself, but I have found peace in knowing that the inspiration to see such prosperity not only persists past my death, but grows throughout my life."

That's why I have been almost never clingy with other people and enjoy being alone.

Now with meditation, that part of my personality has become even more noticeable because now I let things go even easier than before and I recently realized that this might not be convenient when it comes to maintaining interpersonal relationships as others usually expect you to be attached to them or to miss them when they're away, for example.

I always try to show compassion to others and express verbally what they mean to me, but don't want to come of as insensitive or make them think that I don't care about them because I do.

Has anyone here experienced this? How can I make non attachment compatible with having nice relationships with people who don't value letting go as much?"

Berabouman,2021-04-22 23:55:07+00:00,"Meditation is not working too well for me, kind of ""not as advertised""","I'm aware that everyone's experience is different and that it won't be a one size fits all thing, and that I can't expect to see results that quickly. I have been working on it quite diligently though.

I first started meditating seriously at about age 30, a few years ago. I did sitting meditation, focusing on the breath. I could do it up to about 30mins to an hour daily without many problems. I didn't feel very much different though.

Then I read up - Jon Kabat Zinn, Mindfulness in Plain English, assorted other books. I thought they were pretty good! I even attended a few Buddhist classes taught by experienced meditators but still didn't feel that much better. Tried yoga as well. 

My last recent stint was after a sudden hospitalization a few years back. I did it with some Youtube videos, communicating with my Higher Self. Still the same schedule. Still did not feel appreciably better, if at all.

I'm feeling a little disappointed at this point because I have put in the work (months and a lot of research) I am aware as the books say that it's better to do it regularly over a long period then a lot at once, but I don't really feel any different than when I meditate or when I don't. Everyone's body is different - like my therapist says she falls asleep moments after the body scan, I can do the body scan 25 times and I don't feel any different (seriously)

I thought of asking here to gain more insight and knowledge. It may be that meditation and yoga just aren't for me (I've done classes in both, I think the teachers weren't that bad) or maybe I am doing something wrong?"
coffeeinleggings,2021-04-22 23:07:06+00:00,Tips to get back into meditation after a terrible experience with a coach?,"First time posting here but hoping I can get some good ideas! I've always loved the idea of meditation but I've struggled to actually get into a lasting habit. Last fall I hired a fitness coach- I really liked how realistic(not intense bodybuilder routine) the plan seemed and I loved that a key part of her plan was meditation. Everything was going great- I was finally meditating on a regular basis and I was seeing great results. I was a little on edge when she recommended I listen to a talk her ""mentor"" was hosting. Then she instructed me to do these recorded meditations with this mentor every day. It started going way beyond just meditation and my husband got concerned with how much of a cult it was starting to sound like. I did some research and  discovered it had been reported multiple times as a cult and that this leader was not a good guy. It was really scary- I'd heard stories about these kinds of groups but I'd never gotten recruited before or gotten this close to a situation like that. 

I know that meditation is completely separate from this encounter but I'm having a very hard time separating the two. Every time I sit down and try to mediate I can not get her out of my head and I start reliving the whole ordeal and feel more anxious and stressed than I did before I tried to meditate.

I really would like to get back into a regular meditation practice - does anyone have any ideas on how I can get past this hurtle and back into a good routine?

Darius-Mal,2021-04-22 19:54:56+00:00,Formal sitting practice vs moments of meditation throughout the day,"I believe it depends on the contemplative school of thought, but many say there's a misconception that meditation necessarily involves having a formal practice. The idea of ""insight"" means the insight is always available. When one sees through Maya (illusory nature of reality/self), then it doesn't really matter when you meditate. If you see through Maya at random, punctuated times of the day enough, you could easily be meditating a lot more than those with formal sitting down practices

That being said, I'm wondering if people who practice both styles of meditation could tell me the costs and benefits of each. Like might they differ in terms of the ways they could help anxiety? Maybe they differ in terms your moment to moment suffering, I dont' know.."

TheWikiLeaker,2021-04-22 19:01:13+00:00,I’m beginning to understand what it is to be present,"Today, whilst meditating, it became clear to me how my perception of the world has been so negative due to the environmental conditioning of my childhood. I was always in survival mode constantly thinking people see me negatively. This is not the truth. Nobody is even thinking about me. It was just my truth that constant repetition of the same thoughts  became my perception of reality. Subconsciously acting out the same habit loops because as far the brain is concerned that ensures survival. 

So much time spent worrying about what other people think. But that thought itself is merely an illusion - what I think other people think about me does not exist. This isn’t real. 

To be fully present is to see through the illusion of thought and not let our perception be dictated by false realities."

whatisagoodlife,2021-04-22 18:15:18+00:00,Try to ignore much of how meditation is sold by meditators and meditation companies alike,"I'm tired of seeing companies describe their users as serene, blissful, calm etc. Meditation is a tool, it doesn't make you impervious to experiencing the ups and downs of life.

I've been meditating for 6 years, I've done a handful of Vipassana silent meditation retreats and I have a daily practice. Few things have been more beneficial in my life, but I find meditators and companies completely misrepresent it. I think companies exaggerate its positive effects and meditators do likewise.  They have spent their lives being good students in school and good employees at work and can't help themselves in trying to be ""good"" meditators. None of which is my business, each to their own. The problem I have is that in both the exaggeration of it affects and in the exaggeration of the depth and serenity of someone's practice, it leads people that are new at meditation to feel like they are doing it wrong or that they are bad meditators. 

The trap I see a lot of meditators fall into, and I have myself too, is that the newbie gains (for lack of a better expression) are so powerful with meditation in the first year of practicing you think this will be a consistent upward curve. You get ahead of yourself with delusions of potential enlightenment further down the track. Instead of just acknowledging this, meditators can create their own prison in fronting continued serenity, when they are most likely realising that life is still very hard, even though they're meditating. This often creates a very insincere portrayal of meditation, where you can feel someone's words and way of being are not aligned. I think non-meditators sense this and it's quite off putting.

This is compounded by the likelihood that most of us come to meditation to heal some wounds, I didn't come to it following a virtuous epiphany - I needed it. So if previously we've expressed a vulnerability to others in our suffering, now we want to show that not only have we recovered, but now we are better than ever and we can help others be better too. It leads to a lot of preaching. 

None of this is a harsh self-judgement or judgement of others, it all very human and understandable, but I don't think us preaching the virtues of meditation in our early years of practice does a lot for inviting or interesting others to meditate. There are certain behaviours that people adopt like a uniform with meditation - be it hushed voices from teachers, a sense that we have superior consciousness or awareness than others who don't meditate, that we'd be better letting go if we'd like meditation to continue helping as many people as it can."

AnHonestApe,2021-04-22 14:43:49+00:00,Listen,"I in many ways consider myself a methodological naturalist mixed with eclecticism and dialetheism, as confusing as that is for many, I’m sure. But after years of self mental torture, I have been more free than ever recently because I learned to listen to something speaking inside me despite the contradictions it can create for my acceptance of methodological naturalism.

There is a certain inner voice talking to you right now. It does not speak in a human language, though you can learn to translate what it is saying into words. It speaks peace, quietness, stillness, contentment, and pure motion/action. Hearing it requires a quieting of you emotions and thoughts which come from different forms of meditation and dedication to the practice. I personally practice general mindfulness meditation for my thoughts and emotion surfing for my emotions. It wants you to listen to it speak, and that’s it. That’s how it communicates, through your passive listening. Responding may make it go away. It is constantly reiterating the point of the universe to you: relax, be at peace, be content, and simply be an object in the universe. Everything else is unneeded extra. Things will happen despite your thoughts and emotions. Progress will happen without them. In fact, you may find progress feeds off the lack of your obsessive thoughts and emotions. 

Just some thoughts recently. Whenever I forget, I’ve found myself in misery. When I remember, pure bliss, and thank this universe I’m getting better at remembering: just listen."

Beardeddude42,2021-04-22 14:12:19+00:00,Personal technique breakthrough,"Hey, I just wanted to share something I recently discovered that works very well for me and see if someone might know the name for this technique so I can read more into it. I just kinda stumbled on it while meditating. Iv done this a few times now so I know I can repeat it.

So I start with just the basic focus on the breath technique. I do this for a bit as I wait for the level of presence in the moment I need to move to the next step. I may loose myself for a while but I know eventually I'll get there.

So then the next step is to make my reaction to any sensation/experience to be notice it. 

For example in normal life if you hear an unfamiliar sound you first realise that something is new/different. Then your mind groups the related tones together into one thing (like a cars passing has whooshing from the air and a vibrating sound from the tires). I just apply this to every sensation in my total experience. I first notice that something is different then I notice what parts of my experience are that thing. This happens for everything, every thought, every feeling, every input, potentially multiple times a second. 

What the thing is doesn't matter. Another part of myself will identity it and react to it. I just do that same thing with that new reaction. I identify something is new and then notice what it consists of. Then another part of me will react and identify that and again it doesn't matter I just do the same thing again. I dont label anything, there are no words. This is just base level understanding.

I find this task way easier to focus on then my breath. With my breath its the same thing over and over and I end up drifting. With this process its always new. I can let my attention flow like it wants to I am just holding on to the process. Not as a high level thought but as a gut reaction, I have it be my method of handling reality.

If I correctly notice a sensation/experience/thought it will suddenly play well with the other parts of me and fade away. If it sticks around then generally there is another thing in my experience that is part of it I haven't identified and once I include it it will play nice and fade. Sometimes the thing is more complex and there is a core to it. The rest fades but I need to notice the thing that was supporting the thing.

The first time I did this when my timer went off I just handled it the same way. I didn't stop meditating. I just noticed the parts of my mind that reacted to it. Noticed the parts that reacted to those reactions, watched the slow train of reactions that gave the timer meaning and the slow train of reaction that tired that meaning to my purpose. And even then it took me a while to actually remember how to act. The whole thing was probably only a few seconds but I felt that I watched myself place together my whole way of being to do it. It was trippy as hell.

Hopefully I explained that well. What is this technique called and where can I learn more?"

Whether  it is a painful, itchy, tingling, pounding, or any other sensation, I  simply learned to observe biochemical reactions in the body without  aversion or desire. Just observe.  
**Everything is temporary**  
After  a few days the pain was gone, sometimes it came back, and then it went  away. The entire body is just a bunch of atoms jumping around all the  time. I experienced that the only constant is change.  
**Experience is the teacher**  
I  have read hundreds of books about psychology, mindfulness, success and  happiness but nothing beats experience. The books made me smart, the  experience makes me wise.  
**Now is the moment**  
The  beauty, timelessness and universal feeling of the present moment is  beyond anything I have ever experienced. Take 10 days to gift it to  yourself."

Is there even such a thing as cheating during meditation or is it simply a matter of finding different tools for achieving the same purpose (i.e. focus), such as counting the breath or deepening it?

I wonder what your views on this are and if you have any other ""cheats"" :)

DreamVerse1,2021-04-22 12:38:03+00:00,Grabovoi Healing Codes/Numbers - Meditation Mantras (Manifesting Miracles)," 🌟Hi Guys!  
Have you heard of the Grabovoi Codes?  

 🌟They are radionic signature numbers to heal various aliments. It is also used for wealth, prosperity, and success. It is similar to a visualization meditation. The [numbers are repeated](https://youtu.be/UuV4X7_hPgE) in a sequence and visualized flowing into a white sphere. 

 🌟Radionic theory is the concept that man and all life forms share a common ground and are connected within an electro-magnetic field on Earth. If this field within you is distorted it will result in disease and mental instability. Everything carries it's own particular ""number"" frequency or vibration. These numbers can be used to identify and treat disease at a distance. Grabovoi identified these unique numbers and had clients meditate on them resulting in miraculous recoveries and changes in life patterns. 

 🌟 Our idea is to spread the knowledge of how powerful numbers are and that they vibrate in a specific frequency which we can all use to our benefits. Numerology has been a part of humanity since ancient times and frequency is the language it uses.  

🌟By using these Grabovoi Mantra meditations you can put your head phones and turn the volume to a comfortable level, visualizing your desired result. By meaning ""Mantra"" is  a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation &amp; a statement or slogan repeated frequently. This is why our new series aims to help you not only listening to meditative sounds and visualizing the number but hearing it repeatedly. 

**Here are two Grabovoi Meditation Mantras you can try out - &gt;**

1. Sit straight (or stand straight). Head up, spine vertical (no slouching). Legs should fully touch the floor.
2. Smile. Even if you don't feel it. If you catch yourself not smiling, put the smile on again. You don't have to feel like smiling - just put the smile there.
3. Breath through your nose only.

Do this while working - it works beautifully if you're sitting in front of a screen. You should feel a calmness emanating from your belly."

 ago I started sitting straight with no support and the effects have been remarkable!  It was excruciating at first, as I have bad posture. But accepting the pain is part of the process!  I slowed worked up from 30 min to 2 hours / day.  

I am lighter, calmer, more compassionate, more present, more loving and experiencing glimpses of joy at living that I have not experienced in a very long time.  Accepting the back pain and identifying it as a “sensation” has helped me become more equanimous when dealing with strong emotions.  Why is this posture so vital?  I suspect that it might have something to do with biofeedback: our postures impact our mental states. For instance, furrowing one’s brow, even if only in response to sunlight, can signal to the brain to be on guard. What are you thoughts on this?"
TheRealVorador,2021-04-22 03:46:28+00:00,"Recommendations for Meditations to Contact ""Extraterrestrials"" Please","I want to be hit with the hardest stuff you got. Some background: I am looking for meditation methods/videos/audio files (guided, binaural beats, hypnosis, astral projection, remote viewing, anything goes!) to contact ""extraterrestrials"" - I put extraterrestrials in quotes because I am referring specifically to the entities known as ""the Greys"" - which I feel can best be described as more ""entities"" than ""aliens"". I say this at the risk of sounding completely 'crazy', but - I have a strange connection to these specific entities, and have had for a very long time, and I want to further explore it. 

I have experience (literally decades of it now) with these type of ""contact"" meditations specifically with these entities, and I was wondering if anyone else here has done this, or ""extraterrestrial/interdimensional entity contact"" meditations in general. I would not say that these years of experience make me 'good' at this practice by any means - but I have had experiences.

To lay it all out on the table - I'm basically talking about ""seeing through The Veil"" - I know this can be a terrifying and potentially mentally damaging experience (believe me, I do, I've been there - you will have 'lucid nightmares' for a damn good while) - but - I've already been doing this for decades and this was more something that 'found me' as opposed to me 'finding it'.

My goal is simple - see through The Veil - attempt contact - and then attempt to interpret those visions  through Automatic drawing and writing. 

As I said - I've done this before - but I want to get better at it."
abolish98,2021-04-22 03:32:55+00:00,I cannot convince myself that meditation is not just an esoteric placebo.,"Throughout the last years, I've always been interested in altered states of consciousness. Lucid dreaming for example is something that has proven to be actually working for me. I've managed to have countless lucid dreams and I do it almost instinctively nowadays. There is no doubt for me that it's actually possible.

Sadly, I cannot say the same thing about meditation. No matter if I go with or without music, with or without guidance, with or without special breathing, different posture, different times of the day, before or after eating [...] - I just don't feel any effect whatsoever.

If I had to rate my experiences in regards to how strongly they affected my mind, an LSD trip would be at 90% and lucid dreams at 75% while meditation is still an absolute 0%.

Because I've been unable to observe the slightest effect of meditation so far, I tend to believe that it's actually just a placebo. To be honest, most of the people who share their meditation stories sound like crazy water diviners to me.

How can I tell esotericism and real (?) exercises apart?

PariahPoet,2021-04-22 02:49:51+00:00,Simple Meditation! In ways you already know and love: For Beginners,"If you have ever ""Zoned Out"" that IS meditation. So if you're new to meditation simply begin by zoning out! If you can, try to go deeper into it. This will instantly get you into the ""zone"" aha. Of course this may seem too easy. But it really is that easy. Just zone out, then boom you're in the zone. After this simply focus on feeling. Feel your emotions and the blood flowing though your veins and arteries.

Daydreaming is also a form of meditation, simply enter the world of your dreams and let your creativity fly. Attempt to become extremely invested in the world you have created. This is extremely good for beginners. Masturbation paired with this is pretty amazing as well.

Do not try to force your mind to be clear. Let the thoughts flow in and out of you. Let them go as they leave. If you try too hard to have a clear mind, it will have the opposite effect. Simply relax and let your mind fly. Embrace the thoughts that come to you. Some of them may be important in your uh 'spiritual journey'. Thanks for your time and good luck!"

 And while I'm not downplaying the benefits of *essential oils and crystals and stuff*, I don't trust the blogs that value natural remedies over modern medicine.

I started reading anything I could and began meditating regularly. It seemed to be working on short term anger, joy and focus as well as ability to put in the work. But as time went on, it felt like my long term happiness was showing no improvement. Then I came across some books refuting meditation on the premise that by meditating, we are creating this problem of anxiety essentially by saying ""I have a problem called anxiety or lack of happiness and I will improve it by doing prescription X"". This line of thinking resonated with me at the time and since then, almost a year ago, I have not been meditating. Overall, my happiness and peace seemed to be better at times after stopping meditating, but I still find myself wondering if I should be meditating and still longing that ""enlightenment"" transformation. Anyone been in a similar position? For those interested, the books I read refuting meditation were by Kapil Gupta."

Darius-Mal,2021-04-21 23:26:41+00:00,Punctuated meditation vs formal sitting practice,"I believe it depends on the contemplative school of thought, but as you know, there's a misconception that meditation necessarily involves having a formal practice. The idea of ""insight"" means the insight is always available. When one sees through Maya (illusory nature of reality/self), then it doesn't really matter when you meditate. If you see through Maya at random, punctuated times of the day enough, you could easily be meditating a lot more than those with formal sitting down practices

That being said, I'm wondering if people who practice both styles of meditation could tell me the costs and benefits of each. Like might they differ in terms of the ways they could help anxiety? Maybe they differ in terms your moment to moment suffering, I dont' know.."

On Tuesday (04/13/21) I decided to watch a new video that claimed to refresh and balance all of my chakras. I did this meditation at night when I was already very tired so I fell asleep with the video still playing. 
I woke up feeling aware and different, it felt off now that I think about it. It felt like I no longer felt the energy around me. I no longer get goosebumps when I step outside, when I used to feel energy pretty easily. 
I thought this feeling would have disappeared overnight but when I woke up the next morning I still felt empty. 
It wasn’t until yesterday when I though well this is really bad. So I worked on my root chakra mainly and I also stayed outside barefoot to really soak in the earths vibration. I feel like everything is coming back slowly.
I wouldn’t want to go through something like that again. Has anyone ever felt off like this before?"
UnChienDEspace,2021-04-21 21:23:07+00:00,Dissociation by meditation,"Hi all

While I'm typing this, I'm dissociating as a result of a short meditation. It's quite scary, and I'm hoping someone could give me some insight in why this happens and how to deal with this.

Background:  
I'm not new to meditation. I've done two 10-day vipassana retreats and have been meditating on and of for years (be it not very often or regular: let's say I have a total milage of 500 hours). Never dissociated before.  


Four days ago something scary happened while I was trying some technique I am experimenting with. The first time I used this technique was in the retreat, and I had the most happy, most empowering meditation because of it. What I do is this: instead of doing the Goenka-bodyscan, I feel the whole body at once. Then I try to get 'behind' the feelings / put my awareness on them. Then I notice some gross tensions. I put my awareness on them, and let them go. I keep repeating for every tension. These tensions get smaller en smaller, until only some small twitches come up. I let them go. What happens then is that my consciousness kind of shifts, I can feel it happening, like an elevator taking off. Usually this leads to a very clear, bright experience.  


Now four days ago, I was in bed at night. I decided to do this technique. Halfway I remembered a scary story about someone who had a bad trip with an Out-Of-Body experience where a scary man was standing next to his bed. I got scared thinking of this. Decided to still keep doing the technique. Even though I was so scared, somehow I managed to have the shift in consciousness. But I guess that in the moment when the shift happened, I was expecting to have this scary man appear next to my bed. He didn't appear of course, but still I've never been so scared as I was then. My chest was pumping, my eyes were uncontrollably twitching, and some energy was running up my spine. I decided to try and stay calm, keep my awareness on the body. I wasn't sure if would be able to break the 'trance', or be able to move. This thought scared me further. I think I held on for 30-ish seconds before I couldn't hold it anymore and decided to move. This broke the 'trance'.  


I didn't sleep no more that night. It's possible that I was dissociated the rest of the night, somehow I don't remember anymore. The next day I was fine, like it was just a bad dream. However, in the evening I started spontaneously dissociating. I was scared again, but managed to get a few hours sleep. Next day fine again. So I started thinking that it had to do something with the evening/night. And sure enough: by nightfall, while I was still actively doing work on the pc, I started dissociating out of nowhere. No sleep that night, because I wasn't sure if it was safe to stop resisting the dissociating feeling in the back of my head that was pulling me away. So I resisted it all night. Fell asleep in the morning. But this time the dissociating wasn't gone when I woke up.   


So at that point I decided that it had nothing to do with day- or nighttime. I decided I was just freaking myself out, scaring myself so badly to the point of trauma, hence the dissociating. Next day was better. And now I am here, I thought I'd go back to meditation, but it's triggered it again. Even though I was strictly adhering to the ""The Mind Illuminated"" techniques for Stage 3 - 4.  


I have no idea how to deal with this!"
goody-two-sneakers,2021-04-21 21:01:29+00:00,Guided Meditation Recommendations?,"I’m still getting into the swing of meditating. I want to have a more daily practice and I’m looking for an app or podcast or YouTube channel that I can rely on as my daily go-to while I’m still learning which techniques work best for me. 

I’ve been using Balance (specifically the foundations course), but I’m not in love with the basic training and the limited duration (5 or 10 minutes). 

I’m looking for something more spiritual: working with chakras, grounding, clearing negativity, energizing, etc. More on the hippie side than the breathwork-focused side.

I prefer 15-30 minute guided meditations. 

Does you have a go-to app, podcast, or YouTube channel that you can recommend?"
McInSlosh,2021-04-21 20:59:50+00:00,I never thought about it.,"So , I am not your typical meditation-type-of-guy. None of my friends have considered it, and I would have never tried, if it weren’t for my best friend killing himself. 

I take 2 weeks off of college. Tell all my instructors I need personal time , whatever the cost. I start smoking tons of weed, drinking my face off and basically crying myself to sleep for a couple nights. And then I ask myself “why did he do it” obviously , I couldn’t find an answer, so I realize I’m going to have to move on. But how? 

I think it was a YouTuber Actualized.org , bald guy , who first gave me insight on how to start. 

I didn’t want a fucking happy go lucky guy to tell me it’s all going to be alright , I just wanted some instruction. 

So I found a technique that worked for me in my darkest hour. It was simple enough , cross your legs , sit up straight , and literally don’t move a muscle. 

Try for as long as you can , when I first started I couldn’t last more than 30 seconds or a minute before I had to scratch an itch or re adjust my position. But as I went on I could sit still for minutes, and up to a half hour and once I did 45 minutes. 

The idea was basically if you can resist an itch , it will pass. You don’t need to scratch it, it was true, second point was that what are you doing ? Your doing nothing. In my mind is the basis of meditation. You are blocking everything out and focusing on the noise within yourself.

Talking about breathing , I got frustrated with focusing on breathing techniques, so I let my body breath naturally, and after some time you won’t have to think about it. 

Getting into deeper stuff here, I always pictured 1 of two things when meditating, I am very visual , so this was easy for me, 

1 :
your mind is a sky, every thought coming through is a cloud, some last a long time , some are dark and scary , others are pleasant, light a fluffy. But the main point is that they do pass , allow the thoughts to come in and out, you can get lost in a thought sure 

“ thinking about my dog, why I love her, why I hate her, what made me think of the dog ? Oh wait ok clouds , do I want it to pass ?? Meh her coat has such a wonderful color ... “ but allow new ones to come. 

2 : mind is a lake , birds eye view so u can see the coast and the shore , personally I always think of a mirror sheet of water , thoughts are ripples , how long will they go ? Will the bounce off the coast and reciprocate back into a tidal wave ? No. It’s a lake , thoughts will settle and your surface will return to a mirror like sheen, until of course a new thought or “ripple” comes through. 

Let the thought pass so a new one can come in. This is what meditation is for me , allowing thoughts to come in and manifest and go into a deeper train of thought is fine, as long as you let them go and accept new ones. 

Helped me come to realization to what was in front of me, become more aware of my emotions and how I express them. There are a ton of hidden meanings in my previous words so I won’t continue , anyways hope that helps 🤘🍻"

delanodollar21,2021-04-21 18:28:39+00:00,Starting Meditation but it doesn’t feel good,So like the title says I started meditation two weeks ago with binaural beats from YouTube and some videos I feel ok but most I get this very irritating feeling especially with my earphones on it’s like I need escape the noise I need it stop because its interrupting my sleep  so now I usually just play the videos next to my pillow on low volume while I sleep but I don’t think it’s having any good effect that way. What does this mean is this normal in the beginning and I just need to persist ? Or something else ?
6joeNATHANcarder9,2021-04-21 18:10:06+00:00,Severe panic attack mid session,I started meditating a while ago (18m btw) and I go up in time 30 seconds every few days. I'm at 15 minutes right now about 12 minutes in I had an extreme panic attack. I couldn't really move and my vision got blurry and wavy. I tried to just observe it and did for about 40 seconds before it got to be too much. I fully opened my eyes and started breathing really hard which fixed it and I went back to meditating. Can anyone tell me why this happened?

Not only that but it becomes stronger than gravity since you cant defy it. Your grandpa could be knocking and suddenly your having a full blown UFC fight with a body part. 

After meditating with the monks at vipassana, my body was starting to defy gravity in the same way since i wasnt forcing it down. Let go of your boner man."

Our talks and meditations are based on powerful Tibetan Buddhist mind training techniques that use imagination, emotions, and critical inquiry to probe our inner and outer realities and expand our compassion. 

As the host, I'm trying to bring the inner science of Buddhist meditation to twenty-first century people hungry for happy, meaningful lives, with my producing partner Stephen Butler.

Our first  episode is a great place to start: [Episode 1: What is A Skeptic's Path to Enlightenment?](https://www.skepticspath.org/podcast/1-what-is-a-skeptics-path-to-enlightenment/)

And this week's episode [""Alone Together""](https://www.skepticspath.org/podcast/episode-13-guided-meditation-alone-together/) addresses the dual problems of people sheltering in place, some of them feeling very lonely, while others overwhelmed with the constant presence of their families and roommates.

We'd love to get feedback from anyone interested in this type of secular meditation inspired by science and the challenges of the modern world.

twatsup,2021-04-21 15:26:42+00:00,I feel like I’ve lost my personality after 2 years of meditating almost daily and learning more about Buddhism. Looking for some new perspective.,"I’ve been feeling really empty inside lately, almost robotic in going through day to day life. I feel as though my personality is gone and I’m just a sort of ghost. 

I’m sure much of it has to do with a year of being isolated and interacting with others mainly online (I’ve been working from home for over a year now). But, I’ve been feeling like my meditation practice has something to do with it too. After letting go of thoughts and feelings, whether they’re good or bad, what else is there?

I know meditation is supposed to spark more joy in the day to day, but it all feels so mundane. I’ve lost interest in socializing and generally just don’t really know who I am anymore. 

Is this an ego trick? Am I just overthinking everything or taking it too seriously?

My best guess is to keep going and see what happens, join a local meditation center and find a sangha again when it’s safe to meet in person (so soon!), but I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this and has a different perspective to share. I love a good reading recommendation!"
_Comrade_Tito_,2021-04-21 15:24:42+00:00,I've just meditated for the first time,"So I've been thinking about this whole meditation thing for the longest time now but I've never actually tried it out,and so I've decided that today is the day I'd give it a try.

I looked up a youtube video on meditation and how to do it (I'll link the video in the comments if I can) ,and I'd like some input and preferably any suggestions on videos or blogs that could help me get a better understanding.

Anyway the way I went about it was I placed a few objects around me so that they were in my peripheral vision (I've seen a post on here about how this improves focus),I set an alarm to go off in about 5 minutes then I sat,crossed my legs,placed my arms in a comfortable position,and just breathed slowly.

I tried to keep my mind clear of thoughts by focusing on my breathing,but I stil had a few thoughts pop in here and there.What surprised me the most was how quickly it was all over,I expected it would feel like an eternity.

Anyways I'd like some suggestions as I'm pretty much new to this entire thing."
Leading-Blueberry-31,2021-04-21 14:23:37+00:00,How would I get over the dread of disappointment when attempting to complete work? I stress such a great amount over the task/project that it prevents me from beginning it.,"At the point when I was an understudy, I struggled to think and tackle my tasks efficiently particularly bunch projects. I realized what to do yet I had no certainty at all and my fixation range was extremely low in view of the constant and redundant considerations and stresses in my psyche. I couldn't control or stop my concerns. I had plenty of inquiries, for example, am I doing it right? What on the off chance that I come up short? How might my partner see me? Will they like me? Imagine a scenario where I bomb them. 

My concerns were extremely negative and I was unable to center by any means. Now and again I had this sensation of sadness and wanted to surrender. The most exceedingly terrible thing is, I have consistently accepted my concerns, that they may occur. In any case, they won't ever occur... Despite that, I actually stressed. 

One day I went over where they encourage contemplation and I select and start to ponder. My contemplation educator gave me the strategy for discarding the human psyche, which comprises karma(life lived), propensities, and body. On account of the human brain, that is the reason I had every one of these concerns and couldn't focus well on any undertaking, particularly at school. 

After pondering altogether and earnestly for some time, I understood that these concerns were bogus and they were simply encounters of my past occasions. I was alleviated and my concerns were totally gone. Hence I would now be able to focus well on a solitary assignment, do it well with no psychological deterrent, work truly and well with others without stress. 

So I will share a short video that will assist you with seeing how reflection can assist you with conquering the concerns and dread of disappointment."

Specially during winter months when I’m wearing long coats and heat/static/humidity starts building up inside my clothes, I kinda feel a bit of a sensory overload. Been feeling it my entire life, but only recently been able to understand what that uneasy feeling actually is, feels like walking into a different slightly uncomfortable magnetic field."

vikas0o7,2021-04-21 12:44:55+00:00,Don't stop meditating even in best of your times when you think you don't need it.,"I used to meditate regularly and the months of meditation really  benefited me. But then slowly, I started slacking off, telling myself that I feel good anyway, everything is going well, so I don't need to meditate. Few months down the line, I think that was a huge blunder on my part to slack off. Now, I am suffering from stress(work, family related) on daily basis, my routine has become shit,  but now I can't bring myself to sit and meditate. Also, **I have realised that it is much harder to meditate when you really need it.** It is much easier when you are in good state of mind to continue doing it. So, I would like to reiterate to my  fellow mates that please don't stop meditating. Make it part of your daily routine. The benefits conveniently surpass the time and effort you put into it."

pythasaurus,2021-04-21 11:25:15+00:00,After 1 month I had what may have been my first 'breakthrough'. Would appreciate insight.,"About a month ago, I went through a pretty bad breakup. I've constantly been riddled by thoughts about how I could've been a better guy or did things differently. Constantly wondering why I wasn't accepted. Long story short, I found meditation to help me deal with it. My sessions are generally 20-30 minutes, simply focusing on the breath. If I have a lot of time, I will meditate for an hour. If I'm busy or feeling lazy, I will meditate for 5 minutes and get back on track the next day.

Fast forward to today, after a month of meditating, towards the end of my hour-long session I was overcome with a sense of euphoria. I felt like I finally made contact with my 'true self', unpolluted by anything external. I suddenly felt no pressure to be accepted by others because I finally accepted myself. Tears rolled down my face at this realization and I let go of past regrets. I truly felt that those no longer a part of my life are missing out, but I felt no animosity toward them and wished them the best. This feeling only lasted for 30 seconds or so before external thoughts flooded my mind again and I lost touch with my true self.

If this is what meditation has to offer, I am extremely glad I took it up. I cannot wait to see what more this world has to offer. I'm still curious, what did I experience? Have others experienced the same?"

But now its getting warm and I've started meditating outdoors with a lotus position. 5 minutes in, my back starts to hurt. I try fix my position, but now I can feel how my legs are being stressed by trying to balance my weight. As the weight distribution between my entire upper body and my legs arent even. If i lean forwards a bit to balance the weight and rest my legs, my back hurts again :(

How did you guys learn your lotus position? And any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!"

DavidMc843,2021-04-21 07:43:44+00:00,A Gentle Reminder,"Meditation is a learned skill.  It is an exceedingly rare individual that “gets it” as soon as they start.  Just like any skill, it takes time, dedication, and instruction to develop.  No one goes from learning the ABCs to reading on a college level in a week.  No one picks up a ball and is being recruited by pro scouts a month later.  And like any other skill, sometimes you will progress quickly, sometimes it takes maximum effort just to keep from regressing.  So, take it easy, be gentle and kind with yourself, and congratulate yourself from time to time.  May you be happy, well, and at peace."

I have a history of ankle injuries. Went to a podiatrist and he recommended surgery on both ankles to repair the shredded ligaments. I had the procedure done on one ankle, but the jury is still out on whether I prefer the surgically repaired side or the natural side.  
  
Anyway, I will probably never be able to get into full lotus. Even when I was young and flexible enough to do, it would literally dislocate my ankles. So no full lotus for me. Half lotus doesn't really feel right either, so I tried cross legged, but my feet fall asleep when I meditate that way. Then I watched a YouTube video where a guy explained how to do burmese position, with both heels in front of the pubic bone, and knees touching my zabuton. It was very stable, I liked it. It did give quite a stretch on my ankles, but no worries about my ankles popping out like lotus. And there was some pain getting out of it because of the stretch, but the pain went away quickly after.  
  
All of this to say: what do.you guys think of burmese position? I think I will alternate between burmese and cross legged. I don't really want to use a chair, though I might try a seiza later."

aFiachra,2021-04-21 06:28:59+00:00,Do you know how all email shows up as high priority? Thoughts are like that too,"I had a good meditation yesterday and the thought occurred to me, “thoughts that arise in meditation always claim that they are super important and that isn’t really true.” So far I have not had the thought, “the house is on fire” or “I hear an intruder” — I have been lucky. But every thought that does show up while meditating has that level of urgency. “Dude, you have to get up now and remember to organize the groceries! You have to make that call about that book that you lent to that guy! You have to post something on social media about lint! Squirrel!”

Thoughts never show up and ask if I have a moment.   I feel like this is one of those things that might be common as I “detox” from overthinking and I wonder what everyone else’s experience has been like with this."

How do I see the unseen that’s already seen more than this? Is there more to emotion than i think i know that I already do? 

At this point I don’t even make sense to myself."

gosha_levin,2021-04-21 00:04:17+00:00,My experience of organizing a 7-day solo meditation retreat,"I dreamed about going to retreat for a long time, but COVID has ruined my plans. So I decided to organize a solo retreat. I've spent wonderful 7 days that I believe changed my life.

I've rented a simple tiny cabin in the forest 3 hours drive from the city. I intentionally took a minimal amount of simple food: mostly rice and frozen veggies. I took an old cell phone without internet. 

Every day I meditated for 1-2 hours. I was sitting on the porch and looked at the forest for 1-2 hours. Also, I walked in the forest and read books. 

My task was to be fully present: to live here and now instead of in the past or the future. I was doing everything very slowly, focusing on everything I was doing. It felt like meditation: making the bed, taking slow showers, walking. 

Also, I wanted to feel my body better, so I tried to eat minimum food. Usually two small balls of veggies and rice every day. I did it because I realized that food to me was escaping from my reality. I could eat to feel something good instead of being with myself which often felt uncomfortable.  I decided for 7 days to use food only as a source of energy to be less distracted. It helped. Every bite felt so delicious, and I could feel my body better on a half-empty stomach. 

After 3 days without internet and with limited food, I started to feel joy just from being. It was nice and felt more consistent than happiness. I realized that happiness depends on conditions and the joy of living is something that I can keep inside forever regardless of circumstances.

After 7 days, something happened inside me... I've read many books about consciousness and awareness, but I think I understood what all these books were about only after this 7-day retreat. 

When I got back home, I felt calm and peaceful. My friends didn't know about my retreat. When I met them, they told me something changed in my face, like I looked happier—also, my relationship with my girlfriend impoved.

It's been 4 months since my retreat. I still feel this joy. 

I decided to write this for those who also want to attend a retreat but postpone it due to logistic problems.  Apparently, you can do it solo."

I’m particularly interested in open eye meditation because they really seem to resonate with me. Years ago, as an experiment I tried an open eye meditation with my gaze at a fixed point.

Recently I’ve been browsing meditation podcasts and decided to try it. The podcast host does her meditation with breath work BUT she does meditation with a Shamanic style. Basically sets a scene and I follow her guidance.




The last 5 times I have mediated with her podcast an unknown gentlemen is my guest. I don’t know this person or a person similar to him. It scares me that I can’t explain why this unknown person is in the equation? I get romantic vibes from him and I can seriously describe this person as if he was real. 



1. 5’7-5’8 height 
2. Detroit Lions football fan
3. Wears aviator glasses when scene is outdoors 
4. Smells good
5. He is kind of bougee - Wear Gucci Cognac loafers 
6. Tan skin
7. Five o clock shadow 
9. Car enthusiast
10. Collects watches 
11. Stone wash ball cap
12. hairy arms
13. Salt and pepper hair
14. In his 40s

It starts like middle or end of my meditation. I m focusing my breath but after little time I just start to focus on thinking nothing and that is the where strain feeling starting in my brain. While I feel that I am not uncomfortable but it is kinda confusing for me. Is that how we start to relax or am I doing something wrong?"

magentaorenge,2021-04-20 20:54:53+00:00,Finding that letting go of stress is... Stressful 😩,"I just finished the 10th day of headspace's ""letting go of stress track"" and I feel very different. I feel my breathing is much more deep and I even feel almost uncomfortably light. It makes sense  why I would be feeling this way as I consider myself a high stress person, but still the effects are so portent they are almost jarring.

I've had other experiences where things that should be good for you leaves you with some insecurity and are even stressful in it's own right; In the example above, I can't help but believe that the stress kept me alert and ready--letting it go would mean letting go of a defense mechanism.
I'm not saying I'm going to stop diving deeper into this area of my practice; it's just that the water is a little too hot for me, and I'm acclimating as I continue to lower myself into the tub.

Any one have a similar story?"

All that we are searching or looking for can be found within ourselves if   we direct the right attention toward what we call Self. In the Sufi   tradition, one of the avenues to reach what is being searched is   gratitude. In this workshop, Shaykh Burhanuddin talks about different   ways of practicing gratitude and its benefits for deepening our daily   practice.

RSVP at [https://www.inner-craft.com/event/the-magic-of-thankfulness/](https://www.inner-craft.com/event/the-magic-of-thankfulness/)

Shaykh  is a contemporary mystic of ancient tradition, called onto the Sufi   path at a young age. In his teaching, Shaykh combines methods from his   Sufi Tradition with contemporary knowledge of psychology. He started the   practice at 10 with Yoga, and between the ages of 14-18 practiced   meditation under the guidance of the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje,   within the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. At 18, Shaykh met   with the grandmaster of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order, one of the most   ancient and authoritative of the many existing Sufi Orders, Mawlana   Shaykh Nazim al Haqqani ar Rabbani, and went through the classic dervish   training under the direct guidance of the Master. He received a direct   transmission of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order. Shaykh is the author of  three  books, a musician and the founder of the Dervish Orchestra."

sheyrak,2021-04-20 17:03:45+00:00,"Being aware of other peoples presence, makes me stiff?","Hey,

I've probably got a weird question here, but please bear with me.

First of all... I am currently in a new working environment and I've been kinda stiff/more shy/awkward than I thought I am... and the ""new environment"" isnt ""that new"" anymore... so it made me think about the reason.

I came to the conclusion that I am always aware of other people in the same room as me. And this is kinda distracting me. Especially when there are more people in the room (and I am sober/not super tired), it kinda distracts me... For example in a small ""group"", small enough that everybody hears everything, but big enough that there are individual topics being talked about, it feels like my brain is lagging behind. I am aware of so many auditive, spatial (relative positions of each other), body language and other informations, that I am less eloquent than I am in smaller groups. As if my brain lags... and my awareness of it only makes it worse.

I feel like this has to do with meditation. The practices I tend to do, are often related to spreading the awareness out in some way. (i.e. concentrating on my ears/auditive signals, my skin, my breath, ""the silent observer Cthulhu"", etc.)

So, what should I do with this ""conclusion""? Try to ignore other people around me? Sounds like a bad idea to me.

SeaDevelopment7075,2021-04-20 16:25:00+00:00,I think I need your help: Sharing my weird experiences,"Hey there, 

Im texting this, right after my meditation, but first, a little bit to my current situation:

Like probably everyone, I’ve been hit by the pandemic very hard.

Lately, I feel exhausted, like I have never felt in my life before: studies, work, and so on. It feels like I’m just about to burn out; but I can still hold it together and I’m not burned out (yet!). 

Anyway, I have tried to meditate with a mantra for 20 minutes per day, mostly before I go to bed. I tried it few months ago, then stopped, now again since 5 days. 
It helps me to get rid of all the stressful thoughts. 
(I haven’t been to a TM Professional as I believe it is a scam and please spare me the “go to a TM Practicioner” answers.) 

I believe I am in a very nice and relaxed state while I meditate, but I don’t know, if I am in “transcendence” or the “bliss” everyone is talking about?

How do I know, is my first question. Here are some weird experiences I make and maybe some of you have had the same :)

Sometimes I feel that my head feels very,
very light and tilts back. It’s a nice feeling, but it doesn’t happen all the time. 

A lot of times, I feel pain on my forehead and my temples, I don’t know If I do something wrong or my eyes are in a wrong position when closed? It’s the same pain as if I would squint. So weird, what the he’ll is that? Is it my pain of exhaustion or do I do something wrong? 

And one experience which I am very curious about is, that my facial muscles start to contract very, very fast and my lips begin to tip and I’m having a “kiss mouth”. 
I really don’t know what’s going on. Maybe the experiences of this community can help me to put things in order. 

I am very curious about your answers and wish a wonderful day. 

Namaste."
xTrainerRedx,2021-04-20 16:18:07+00:00,Don't bother arguing with people.,"Posting this here because I have come to respect this community.

I recently responded to a post about the Law Of Attraction im another sub and shared my experiences with such concepts. Unfortunately the post attracted a lot of negativity from people who were using science to discount what we were saying and call it ""bullshit"".

If you have ever experienced something similar. Use it as an opportunity to grow stronger in your practices. See the negative vibes they are bringing to the situation, and see your ego flare up with desire to argue back and disprove them. You will likely never change their minds.

The irony of the situation is that they were saying negative comments about the LoA, which only attracted more negativity. So if they could see beyond their own mind-driven principles, they would have been able to see the LoA in action.

Never shame your own faith. Even many atheists have faith in their cold, hard facts based in science; yet spit in the face of concepts like *faith* &amp; *meditation*. I respect the applications of science myself, but I am also aware of its limitations and that there are many things it cannot (and may never) be able to explain. My faith picks up where science leaves off.

Stay aware, everyone. See your minds. See your egos. Use meditation and mindfulness practices to access deeper levels of awareness, and make the conscious choice to swim with the flow of life even if it takes you into challenging situations. From there, respond from a place of acceptance and inclusion, not exclusion.

🙏"

They are dependent upon these supports for their very existence. In a sense human beings are also ghostlike, since most of us cannot function independent of money, social standing, honor, companionship, authority; or else we feel the need to identify ourselves with an organization or an ideology. If you would be a man of true worth and not a phantom, you must be able to walk upright by yourself, dependent on nothing. When you harbor philosophical concepts or religious beliefs or ideas or theories of one kind or another, you too are a phantom, for inevitably you become bound to them. Only when your mind is empty of such abstractions are you truly free and independent."

Think about it for a moment. 

What does it really mean to be Human?

And once we know what it means to be Human, how can we express our uniqueness in the best and highest way?

I suppose you would get different answers depending on who you asked.

Biologists and Chemists would probably give you different answers and insights than a Philosopher or a Spiritual Leader would.

They are all valid in their own way.

I believe that a Human Being’s ability to ponder, to wonder, to seek, to attempt to connect to the Divine, to long for connection with self, to pause, to listen, is Life’s ultimate gift to us as a Species.  We are blessed with the gift, the ability to access all the awe of the Universe, the marvels of existence, our own unique selves,  just by stopping for a few minutes, breathing, opening up to the moment, becoming aware, truly Be-ing in our true nature.

In other words, Meditating.

Mediation allows us to experience our time as  Human Be-ings, not Human Doi-ngs."

I am still scatter brained, both on and off of the cushion, but there is definite progress being made.

I am facing a challenge currently.

As I meditate more, I understand that our experience of life comes from within.  

I am slowly but surely removing or cutting back on my vices; alcohol, excessive internet/social media use, sugar, smoking etc.  I see how these keep me stuck in a loop in life,  as I use them as coping tools; for boredom, comfort, avoiding negative emotions.  But I can see how excessively using these vices never allows be to deal with discomfort or my own issues.  

But as these vices drop off, I feel …… I can’t really explain it.  

A sense of emptiness?

I want to keep soothing myself with these things.

But I don’t.

I know if I keep using them I will only prolong this feeling.

But if I don’t use them I have to face this feeling.

It may be emptiness.  It may be something else.  But this truth seems to be coming clearer by the day."
byayush,2021-04-20 13:34:14+00:00,Just finished a 3-day silent meditation course - Meditated 10 hours per day - Vipassana,"An exhausting yet liberating experience. I went to a 3-day Vipassana course and sharing more about the technique and my experience. 

I went for my first 10-day Vipassana course 4 years ago and left on the 6th day. It was extremely hard and I was not prepared for it. Meditating 10 hours a day is no joke. I realized the value of the teachings and decided I would return. 

## But first, what exactly is Vipassana?

Vipassana, which means seeing things as they really are, is one of the world’s most popular meditation techniques. Discovered by Gautama Buddha, it is being taught for more than 2500 years as a universal remedy for all ills (i.e. an “Art of Living”).

In simple terms, it means learning how to control your mind. It is a way of self-transformation, an exploratory journey that, upon completion, results in a balanced mind full of love and compassion. 

## How does the course work?

The technique of Vipassana is taught in 10-day courses all over the world. The principal teacher is Shri S.N. Goenka (Late). All the sessions are his Audio / Video recordings. There are centers all over the world and there is no charge – everything is provided free of cost. The organization is run by donations from old students. It is also non-sectarian and people from all faiths and backgrounds are welcome.

A typical day at the center is a constant loop of **EAT-SLEEP-MEDITATE x repeat**. It might sound fun and easy, but trust me it’s not a retreat, it’s probably one of the hardest things you will do in your life. 

Basic guidelines for the course:   


* Noble silence- which means silence of body, speech, and mind. You are not allowed to speak or communicate in any form for 10 days. (except with the teacher/servers)  

* No reading or writing. No digital devices, of course.   

* Abstain from eating after mid-day. You get two meals; Breakfast at 6:30 and Lunch at 11, followed by tea with fruits at 5, all vegetarian (the meals are delicious).   

* Meditate 10 hours a day for 10 days. 

  
After continuing experimenting with different techniques and apps (calm, headspace, waking up, open eye meditation, TM, etc.), I felt Vipassana would work best in the long term and I finished my 10-day course in 2019. 

The first few days are rough. It takes time to get adjusted to the schedule but in the end, it is so worth it. 

Vipassana is not an escape from the daily trials and tribulations of life, it is, indeed, a way to deal with these trials and tribulations. It is an art of living. Days later after the course, I felt calmer, more grounded, and more in touch with myself. 

At both the courses, I felt a lot might happen while I’m away and how much I will miss out on. I thought about countless emails that might need my attention, missed calls and messages from my friends, and just things happening all over the world. But the reality is far from imagined. Being “off-grid” for 11 days had no impact whatsoever on the happenings of the world. The world doesn’t fall apart while you’re not paying attention to it. 

Today, nearly all of us suffer from anxiety, frustration, and discontent, and this was an opportunity to see what causes me anger and what makes me light up, and then eventually realizing this is all impermanent. 

If you’ve read this far, I highly recommend you give it a go. It’s one of the most challenging yet fulfilling things I’ve done in my life. Maybe it’s not for you, maybe it’ll do wonders for you, you’ll never know unless you try. 

My only advice is to be compassionate to yourself. It’s easy to judge your progress and being on hard on yourself. Adjust your expectations, take more breaks if you need, and have fun in the process. 

Remember, this is all about showing yourself you can do it, so the key isn’t to be perfect, but to simply *improve*. The author who writes one page a day has written a book after a year. The meditator who gets slightly better every week is a totally changed person a year later. I’m still a wretched meditator, but I’m better than I was 2 years ago and I’m hopeful about the future. 

Note: 3-day courses are only for old students. So you need to finish a 10-day course first."

UnderwaterDialect,2021-04-20 05:03:51+00:00,I'm struggling to navigate a sort of fatalism I see in mindfulness.,"A common message I see in mindfulness is not to try and change anything, but to just let it be and experience it. I struggle with this because it feels a bit fatalistic to me, like we shouldn't strive towards happiness or positive outcomes. Here are to examples.

1. Let's say I notice I am feeling sad. After I've allowed myself to feel it for a moment, and explored the feeling, is it ""wrong"" then do something that I think will lift my mood? Is that trying to change it instead of just experiencing it?

2. Let's say I am talking to someone and I can feel the conversation sagging a bit. Sometimes when I notice this I can get myself into a certain headspace where I am more in the moment and more focused on the other person, and this sometimes brings the energy of the conversation back up. Again here, is this ""wrong""? Is it wrong to try and improve the current situation?

I'm struggling to understand where to draw the line between ""just letting it be and feeling it"", and acting in a way to improve the current situation/mood.

Thank you!"

Sad_Fold_2411,2021-04-20 01:10:18+00:00,A thought,"This is my first ever post on Reddit so please forgive me if this is not the place or something that does not belong.

I used to dabble in meditation about a decade ago. I found myself to be happier and all around more peaceful. Years later after life and responsibilities started to pile up, I found myself slipping back into old ways of thinking, as well as getting angrier easier and more annoyed at things I knew shouldn’t annoy me.

I have tried to get back into it, and of course my mind always continues to run around. I recently started trying to listen to every sound around me, and I live in a metropolitan area, so there are plenty. Still my mind moves into thoughts that I know are of a lower vibration. I’ve always been interested in politics and economics yet within the past few years have tried to get away from it. No matter how hard I try to shut out certain thoughts that I don’t want to think about while trying to center myself, I’m learning the more I listen, the easier they are to navigate and move through. 

The more I listen, even if a thought of my personal interests pop up, I’m finding it easier to transcend the interest itself and find what drives that interest. Going deeper into what drives the thought itself and not trying to shut it out has been very liberating. And I can open my eyes with a grin and peace on my face. I’m so excited to continue this journey that I’ve just restarted! It is an indispensable tool to be able to navigate ones mind and I look forward to reading all the tips and stories on this page as a way of furthering my practice. 

Thank you for a place to write what was on my mind, and again I apologize if this is not the place, but it seemed fitting. Much love! ✌️"

They are:  sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and anxiety, and doubt.  They are often seen as obstacles to the practice.  But in reality, recognizing and remedying them IS the practice.  No one is immune.  So, if you’re dealing with one or all of these in your practice, you are actually practicing.  Give yourself some credit for having at least that much mindfulness and insight.  It can be very difficult to recognize them as they manifest in a variety of ways and intensities.  A qualified teacher is invaluable in learning how spot and deal with them."

I used to sit outside and either listen to nature or listen to tibetan bowls until roaches and bugs came and ruined it all lol. 

Anyway, I feel like I need to change what I'm doing in order to go deeper and really improve my focus. That said, I really dislike deep breathing. I don't mind focusing on normal breath, but when it comes to controlling my breath and breathing as deeply as I can, it's never gotten me anywhere other than feeling uncomfortable. I don't have anxiety or anything, but I can't pinpoint exactly why I don't like it. Is it because I don't like it that I should do it? I'll sit in an ice cold shower and focus on my normal breath, and I've sat completely still for an hour while drops of water fell on my head and rolled down my skin and made it itch. If I can do that, surely I can breathe. 

It was once suggested that I dedicate several hours one day to meditation, and I'm pretty tempted to do it. I feel like it's something I need to do to reach a better understanding of myself. 

Does anyone have any tips? I don't think the time I'm dedicating to this practice is being used as well as it could."
SamathaTRUTH,2021-04-19 23:16:53+00:00,I will share with you the secret trick to stopping inner monologue.,"Hello everyone,

I've been meditating/trying to meditate for over 12 years and could never rein in my ADHD-level inner monologue. It never stopped for more than a few seconds at most and I even started believing that it was not supposed to. But that would make concentration meditation impossible, and we know that it isn't.

Anyway, here's the information for all of you, with love:

_focusing on peripheral vision stops inner monologue_

Look anywhere, softly. Gently focus on what you see in the corners of your eyes. That's it!

There's no mention of this apart from in one book I found and like, one old study about hypnosis techniques, but focusing on peripheral vision apparently engages the parasympathetic nervous system, calms you down and stops internal monologue.

I hope this helps many people."

I’ve been meditating on and off for 5 years now ( I can miss few weeks in a month, roughly meditate every 2 days) I’ve been trying to get back on track for a couple of months now, especially since I was diagnosed with ADHD last December. 

This past month I’ve been quite consistent in meditating almost every day, sometimes I can even go for 30 mins and enjoy it a lot.

However when it comes to my ADHD I often struggle a lot with keeping my cool ( especially when PMS hits) y get flustered easily and want to cry, I either have bees in my head or  go completely numb and exhausted mentally.  

I have to agree that along with medication and meditation I have less burnout, and it’s easier for me to calm myself down and continue with my day.

We  wanted to invite you to a free workshop by Tina Rasmussen called  Integration of Psychological Material Following Awakening that will be  hosted today April 19 at 5pm PDT.

As  we all know Awakening does not automatically allow us to transcend the  sense of self and solve our personality/psychological issues. In this  workshop, Tina will talk about different ways and practical exercises  that we can leverage to integrate psychological material that keeps  arising post Awakening.

Please RSVP here: [RSVP](https://www.inner-craft.com/event/integration-of-psychological-material-following-awakening/)

Tina  Rasmussen is a meditation teacher who leads retreats and offers  spiritual guidance and mentoring to practitioners worldwide. Her mission  as a teacher is to foster awakening and its embodiment in worldly life,  through the application of authentic, rigorous Buddhist and modern  practices.

Tina learned to  meditate in 1976, at age 13. In her late twenties, after many years of  practice in Buddhist and modern non-dual traditions, she undertook an  intensive year-long solo retreat during which a profound awakening to  Reality occurred. Some years after that, Tina attended a retreat with  Burmese meditation master Ven. Pa Auk Sayadaw, who ordained her as a  Buddhist nun and later, authorized her to teach. During the retreat,  Tina became the first Western woman to complete the entire Samatha path  in this lineage. Tina also took refuge with Tsoknyi Rinpoche, a Tibetan  Dzogchen teacher, and was initiated into the Nyingma lineage."

What's my situation? Well, I stupidly injured my shoulder by lifting heavy weights with bad form when I was around 17. At age 20 I got a surgery to fix it. Now, 3 years later, my shoulder still feels bad. I went to many doctors, and they all said my surgery was successful, but I still feel like my shoulder is ""weird"" all the time. I guess this is my new normal, but unfortunately it doesn't feel ""normal"" to me. I keep thinking about how ""weird"" my shoulder feels when I'm supposed to be focusing on something else or studying or working out. I've been to multiple doctors and physiotherapists and they all said I'm fine. One physiotherapist said my problem is psychological, and not really physical.

I'm contemplating starting up Passage Meditation, a method created by Eknath Easwaran ([https://www.bmcm.org/learn/getting-startedoverview/](https://www.bmcm.org/learn/getting-startedoverview/)). What brought my attention to this method was the fact that Johns Hopkins uses this method of meditation in conjunction with psychedelic therapy - this combination lead to measurable increases in pro-social behavior (both self-reported and confirmed by others). 

It seems like Passage Meditation hasn't been studied as much as something like MBSR, but in the few studies that have been done the results seem to be just as promising ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12646-018-0448-8/tables/2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12646-018-0448-8/tables/2)).

So next time you sit down for your practice try this
Think of someone in your life or more than one that is suffering whatever that may look like, doesn’t even have to be someone you know maybe someone you bumped into or had contact with and they made you feel something .Think of this person or people before you start your practice and not only do this for yourself but for them as well , and that sense of “trying to find a purpose, or trying to get something out of it” just disappears as the act of meditating itself is enough 

Personal experience: before I start my practice👆🏼 not always but if I remember I ask myself in third person

Why are you doing this ?
And for who are you doing this?

Don’t overthink it , first thought and first person or people that arise in your thoughts and use that to let’s say “fuel your practice”"

It allows you to share your session online and to generate a ""streak"" - but my favorite functionality that none of the other apps in this space seem to offer is the ability to auto silence your phone outside the app, so you still get various tinsha/gongs/bells with custom intervals, but your phone won't otherwise blow up with texts or emails.. I'm still so confused as to why other apps like Headspace don't offer this!!

ladiesman1776,2021-04-19 14:05:24+00:00,Am i doing it right? Anapãna / open awareness,"Decided to revisit meditation and sticking with it for the long term after doing a 10-day retreat in 2017. However, I have some questions as to the validity of the “technique” I am now pursuing. Here is what my practice consists of:

1. Focusing on the breath at the abdomen/nostrils for a while, (20-40 minutes) 
2. Sitting in open awareness without focusing on anything in particular, after building focus through anapana (focusing on the breath) 
3. After sitting in stillness for a while, my knees or back starts aching like hell. I make this pain the object of meditation focus for the rest of the sit, for as long as I can endure (usually no longer than 50-60 mins), whilst maintaining equanimity and acceptance. 

Does the above-mentioned sound like a fruitful meditation technique/practice? Any tips if not?

For my belated 30th (waited on vaccine), I reserved a 4 night stay in a hut on a retired couple's property. It's isolated but safe (I've met these people before, and the location has cell service).

I'm looking to detox from all digital devices, in part to be more in tune with my surroundings and with simple activities. I’ll be keeping my phone off but have a battery bank for emergencies. My instinct to self-soothe with shopping, even at second-hand shops, is one I’ve worked on and relied on less than before, but I want to keep working at it.

Why post this here? I wanted to see if the community had any ideas on activities for the 5 days I’ll be here. I have a book or two I plan to bring, a weaving project, and my yoga mat. The hut is free from anyone else in about a mile in each direction, so I also plan on doing some walking. I plan on taking time to 'do nothing' as well. Meditation is in the cards, of course. Any other ideas? Crossposting on other related subs.

TL;DR: 5 day off grid trip, looking to connect with my surroundings and meditate on simple living principles. Looking for ideas on activities, journal prompts, etc. to fill the time."
DavidMc843,2021-04-19 13:48:49+00:00,"Meditation, or something else?","So one day pretty early in my practice with my first teacher, I went in for an interview so he could check how I was doing.  I was especially pleased with myself.  I thought I was doing great.  

“Oh, my meditation is going great!  Why, after only a few minutes, I get into “the zone” and everything is peaceful and wonderful.  And when the end bell rings 40 minutes later, it seems like just a few minutes have passed.  I love it!”

My teacher looked at me for a minute then said “That’s not meditation.  You zoned out.  You took a seated nap.”  

“Huh!?!?”  Feeling more than a little deflated.

“A meditating mind is bright, alert, aware, and unusually active.  What you just described is anything but.”

“I was so calm and relaxed though.”

“Because you were asleep.  And what’s worse, you’re training your mind to be dull and lethargic.  How did the rest of your day go?”

To be honest, later I flew into a rage in traffic, and was tense and angry the rest of the day about an hour after sitting.  Which was my usual pattern.  Bliss on the cushion, combative soon afterwards.  

“There is no wisdom to be found in sleeping on the cushion.  Neither is there any lasting peace.  Time to choose.  Temporary bliss that dulls the mind and makes your life harder, or learning how to experience reality.”

While I’d like to say I immediately chose the later, in reality I had to think about it a while.  That bliss was sooo nice.  And it was hard to understand how it wasn’t serving me.  But eventually I got it.  True peace and freedom come from being to able deal with reality.  Not temporarily sleeping through it."

The_Light_Bender,2021-04-19 13:36:01+00:00,I AM THE CREATOR OF THIS UNIVERSE,"My masters didn’t teach me to believe I was nothing. You will receive exactly what you ask for. They taught me to believe in myself beyond anybody or anything else in this universe. 

The entire philosophy of creator embodiment is empowering yourself though a rapid process of ascension.

You believe you are the creator, you believe you are every creator, you believe you are even beyond that. 

When you have a broken and shattered belief in yourself, the doubts and negative conditioning go way beyond the conscious mind. You live life acting like a fraction of yourself, never realizing your true power because you were taught not to believe in it. 

This isn’t life, this is slavery. 

There were parts of my life when I was very egotistical, and there where years I spent driving my ego into the shadows. 

I’ll tell you honestly, when I had a pronounced ego, I had many more interactions with Archangels, Ascended masters, and Higher Beings from other dimensions and universes. 

The comparison of living with a deflated and buried ego is like living in 2 different worlds. The world doesn’t respond to you, you get treated like trash, and nothing ever happens because this is exactly how you treat and feel about yourself. 

No body has ever completely eradicated their ego. It didn’t happen. This is the lie of false enlightenment through systemic soul enslavement perpetual disempowerment. 

The books written by the original avatars and masters no longer exist. What we have today are manipulated and watered down versions, translated over way too many languages to even understand the original message. 

It’s one thing to be humble, and it’s another thing entirely to disrespect the very origins of the ancient power that birthed your soul.

You must have absolute belief in yourself and in the power of your soul, that your energy literally creates waves in the collective unconsciousness. 

Throw out all the teachings and start afresh.

MUBTAAB,2021-04-19 12:57:52+00:00,S.N. Goenka compared to Jon Kabat-Zinn,"I had experience with methods described by both teachers. I've been using Jon Kabat-Zinn's method for 5+ years, but last year I went to a 10 day retreat and have been meditating with Goenka's method of Vipassana since. 

The main difference as I see it: 

JK Zinn advisies to focus and be mindful of any stimuli from the environment, including sounds, sensations, feelings and your own thougths, and use your breath as sort of an anchor that you can gently get back to, but the idea is to be in the present moment in a much more general way, observing everything at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Vippasana as described by Goenka is a bit different. Firstly he makes a clear distinction between Anapana and Vipassana. Anapana focuses on the breath and the breath only, and highlights concentration. Vipassana is sort of like systematic scanning the body, piece by piece, part by part observing any stimuli in a more isolated way. You should acknowledge external stimuli like sounds etc, but not pay any importance to them. The idea is, that the external stimuli or even thoughts will inevitably create a sensation on the body as well, so by observing the body we also observe the environment in an indirect way. 

Am I understanding this correctly? Does this make any sense at all? What do you think is the main difference, and which one do you prefer?"

I compare myself to every celebrities, random people with houses, wealths, and fames I see on social media. I even get jealous of animated characters and their lives. Guess what. I compare myself to rich people's pets. I know I shouldn't compare my low side to their brightest side but I wish could've been born like them. So I started avoiding it. I started avoiding listening to these people being happy. I had quit IG and FB. But,at the same time, I feel like I shouldn't just ignore the jealousy arising in me. To feel better, I compare myself to people who I put below me. Like homeless, people who are more poor than me. ""I mean they live, why can't I live?"" Then I feel super bad about it.

whatisagoodlife,2021-04-19 12:10:09+00:00,The problem with a pursuit for perpetual happiness,"A newborn is often described as a good child, if they don’t cry much.  


We mostly smile for photos irrespective of how we feel, taking another if someone isn't smiling.  


We sometimes distract children with shiny toys, something to watch, if they start crying.  


We distract adults with alcohol, food, shopping, something to play or watch, if they are upset.  


“How are you?”, “Yeah, I’m good thanks, how are you?”, “Good, thanks”.  


Good prompts no further investigation, sadness prompts an inquiry.  


Would you attempt to alter the behaviour of two friends laughing, trying to bring them back to a more neutral state?  


It's important to realise that despite what we may project, in-person or online, sometimes suffering and sadness is a fully normal part of life.  


Our repression of, or sprinting out of, sadness is creating a fake world which is robbing us of the lessons we could learn, and of genuine connections.  


We don't necessarily need to fix each other when feeling down - we may just need an empathic ear and time, not a busy mouth and an action plan.  


Until we understand that it is as natural to cry as it is to laugh, we’ll continue to suffer in our pursuit of a perpetual state of happiness."

ManifestAnything,2021-04-19 08:49:48+00:00,How to Overcome Obstacles That Keep Us From Meditating,"There are many reasons why we don't do things that we know are good for us. When I first was exposed to meditation, at about 19 years of age, I was working on my first academic degree. I had begun studying the positive effects of meditation. My exposure to meditation was very scientific, very medical. I learned how meditation was good for your heart, your stress levels and just overall good for your health. I would describe it all in very scientific and medical descriptions exclusively.

While I knew it was good for me to meditate I wasn't overly concerned with keeping my blood pressure down and such. I was a typical 19 year old student and didn't worry about ""long term effects"". Luckily, I did enjoy the benefits of meditation from the very beginning; however, I think that what I didn't realize at the time that I wasn't meditating regularly because I didn't make the time to meditate. While I enjoyed meditating I was ""too busy"" to take the time out regularly to practice it. I basically practiced meditating intermittently and not on a consistent basis.

[***Manifestation Meditation: Seven Steps to Manifestation***](https://natwilson72.medium.com/manifestation-meditation-seven-steps-to-manifestation-d289c09f6b11)

What changed for me was when, years ago, I started meeting people who had been meditating for a very long time. These people shared with me the positive effects of growth with meditation. They explained that meditation was a good way to grow emotionally and spiritually as well as physically. Once I understood that meditation was far more than just a good idea for ""medical/physical"" reasons, I realized that I had to start practicing regularly myself. Having been intrigued with ""growth"" since I was very young, I knew this was my path. Immediately, I got a book on meditation and began studying and practicing regularly. I started meditating every day, twice a day because growing while I'm here on this planet is very important to me and always has been.

I think that one thing that can really help anyone with meditating on a regular basis is to find that ""reason"" you meditate. If you don't have a real drive or reason for meditating, other things become a priority before meditating. If making money, going out, socializing, working, and such all take priority in your life you will find yourself making time for these things while making it harder to find the time for meditation. If you see that meditation provides far more than just medical benefits, that it increases your happiness, your spiritual well-being and so much more, you will find that these are the real reasons to make time to meditate.

I think another thing that keeps many of us from meditating is that meditation, at first, can be difficult. When we first start out it can sometimes be hard for our minds to go into a stillness. It can be a challenge to sit and quiet our minds in the beginning. It takes practice to get to the point where we can sit still, not fidget and bring our minds to a peaceful stillness of meditation. I find that often, the solution to this problem is using a ""Guided Meditation"". You can utilize my own guided meditations online, my audio CD or utilize several other places that offer both free or paid guided meditations. I have found that people who are beginning and use guided meditations have an easier time learning how to meditate and truly bring yourself into the quietness you need. You may also find that you prefer guided meditations or meditating with others. It's much like learning how to ride a bike; once you have training wheels you can take off easily and learn the tricks to go off by yourself eventually.

[***Manifest Money Fast By Being True To Yourself And Your Goals***](https://natwilson72.medium.com/manifest-money-fast-by-being-true-to-yourself-and-your-goals-b1c7fa97e6c4)

That brings me to another reason why some people don't continue to meditate; some people don't like to be alone. What I mean by that is that, it's not that they dislike being by themselves as much as they dislike being by their emotional selves. When you meditate you get to learn about you and what's inside of you. Things come up which you may have ignored emotionally for a long time. You may find there are things you need to work on emotionally; things that have been hidden in the corner of your mind and need to be brought out, dusted off and healed. I highly suggest meditation as a way of finding out if there are things that you need to work out emotionally within yourself. Sometimes being faced with this can provoke a person to step away from meditation because they don't want to face these emotions,but I cannot stress enough how important it is to work through these feelings and thoughts using meditation techniques. I think you will find yourself less stressed and more relaxed once you approach these issues using meditation.

If you do find that you have things come up while you're meditating, make sure that you take time to heal them. If you have wounds from the past or something that requires some healing it's important to get that healing and meditating can be a good process in helping the healing process. Many people utilize meditation in conjunction with therapy, something I encourage when you have things that need to be healed. Meditation is an excellent barometer to let you know how you're doing in your healing process because if you can be still and present with yourself then you're doing pretty well.

Another reason I think people struggle with meditation is simply discipline. Many people have trouble with disciplining themselves to make the time to meditate. In the same way that many people won't make the time to take care of their physical self at the gym regularly; people often won't make the time to take care of their emotional and spiritual self by taking the time to meditate. There's no question, it takes discipline to meditate. You have to set aside time each day to meditate and that's why I encourage people to have a discipline of meditating when they first get up and when they go to bed at night.

An easy way to discipline yourself is to set your morning alarm 30 minutes early to meditate in the mornings and go to bed 30 minutes before your normal bedtime so you can meditate before you go to bed. It's easier to set aside that time in the beginning and end of each day, as opposed to trying to fit it in between a busy schedule. You will find that if meditation is important to you, you will set aside that time you need to practice it. It doesn't matter when it is, as long as it works for you. I suggest the morning and bedtime meditation process because this seems easiest for people to fit into their schedules. Once you start doing this regularly, you will find yourself looking forward to these 30 minute periods you have set aside just for you.

I'd like to encourage you to utilize our online podcasts for meditation to help you become disciplined and take the time to meditate. With the help of our podcasts we can help you find the wonders, the beauty and the true bliss of meditation.

AbruhamLincoln,2021-04-19 04:29:33+00:00,First time i felt truly at peace in my mind in months,"For the past couple months my spiritual journey (not gonna get into it, not the right place) and my mind has been all over and there were a few times where meditation crossed my mind but whenever it did i didnt really want to do it, until tonight where i was just feeling off and all over the place mentally and thought i would try meditation and wow, such a difference. It felt almost alien when the intrusive thoughts stopped and my mind stopped racing. Its almost like my mind was like ""oh damn we doing this again"" and as soon as i realized that it flicked like a switch and my mind became still. As of now there are minimal intrusive thoughts and im thinking as slow as joe rogan talks (no diss just noticed that awhile ago lol) which felt weird but better than it did. Cant believe i couldve been doing this the whole time."
TouchedMePickles,2021-04-19 03:19:36+00:00,Anger issues,"I have a short temper, I get easily annoyed and angry at people like brothers for following me, entering my room and just doing weird things that aggravate me or at my parents for telling me to clean my room and stuff like that, I get much less angry at my parents. I love my parents and brothers and they love me but my anger issues kind of upsets the relationship a bit. So, the reason for posting is because I want to change myself and people tell me meditation might help with my anger issues.

The issue? I don't know how to properly meditate as I get bored very fast and don't tend to follow through with it as I feel I'm not doing it correctly"

Gifaro,2021-04-19 03:00:00+00:00,Body scanning | feeling vs visualizing,"I usually start my meditations by doing a bit of body scanning, something like going from the nose to the fingers of one hand and back. I'm not sure whether I should be feeling each part of the body (feeling) or whether I should be imagining them as I go through them (visualizing).
The difference I notice is that when I visualize my eyes move towards the direction of the part of the body I'm scanning (the eyes being closed).

Not a bad thing at all, but I have been seriously questioning these past few days as to why meditation is not instinct just as drinking water or breathing?

d24602,2021-04-19 01:27:46+00:00,Struggling with the realization tonight that existing is inherently hateful.,"In general, I think a lot of people especially meditators, strive to be peaceful and not hateful, but in doing so you are breeding more hate. Having an opinion, any opinion, is inherently hate. And everyone has opinions. Even people who don’t have conscious ones, they have subconscious ones, such as if they like the taste of a food or not. That’s still an opinion and creates hate.

If you believe in peace and tolerance, that is hateful to people who do not believe in peace and tolerance, Even if you do not hate those PEOPLE, the fact that you hold an opinion that differs is automatically hate and evil. I’ve heard people say that hate is only caused by fear, but I don’t find that to be true. If it were, why would childless adults hate pedophiles? Why would people hate certain foods for tasting bad? Hate is caused by disagreement. Peacefully disagreeing and loving the person who has a different opinion that you FEELS like peace, but it creates hate from the disagreement existing.

Everything that breathes takes away air from the other things that need to breathe. Anything that drinks water takes away from the earth’s water and complicates the water cycle. It’s just hateful, selfish, and evil. But there’s nothing we can do about that. If people stopped existing, animals would perpetuate the cycle of differences and hatred, and then plants would. 

I’ve realized that to be alive inherently means to be hateful, and to be ironic, I hate that. I wish it wasn’t true."
Zac_Jackson,2021-04-19 00:26:28+00:00,Balancing and opening your crown chakra," 

The [crown chakra](https://youtu.be/WhHVN2o6C6U), also known as [Sahasara](https://youtu.be/WhHVN2o6C6U) is often the most difficult to balance out in individuals. 

It is predominantly associated with spiritual growth, and wisdom, which can contribute heavily to a sense of self-satisfaction. 

The Crown Chakra's major function is connecting you with ""[Source energy](https://youtu.be/WhHVN2o6C6U)"" as well as channeling information from other realms. 

By balancing this chakra specifically, it only may result in increased brain function for better memory performance; clarity of thought and understanding; elevate moods with naturally lessened anger responses or stress levels - all resulting in healthier relationships overall.

The crown chakra emits energy to help you rise above the rest of the world and extend your reach. In other words, it helps you to walk the path of true spiritual enlightenment.

How to open your third eye chakra with meditation and music:

1. Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight and your spine erect like an arrow pointing towards the sky.

2. close your eyes. Bring your full attention to the area located at the top of your head. Notice thoughts and feelings as they come and go. Just notice that they are there. Do not attach to them. Just notice them and acknowledge them. Let them go. 

3. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Do this until you feel relaxed then let your breathing begin to happen naturally as you continue to pay attention to your the area where your Sahasara is located.

4. Remind your self that you are a spirit having a physical experience and that. Know that you have the ability to allow cosmic energy to flow through your entire being and that it is this energy that connects you to the Divine nature of the universe.

4. Visualize a bright light like a halo at the location of your Sahasara. Sit with it and refrain from trying to force any kind of result.

5. Repeat these affirmations:

(1) I am a child of the Divine nature of the universe.

(2) I have the ability to transcend beyond the physical realm and and go deep into the spiritual.

(3) I am wonderfully and fearfully made.

(4) I channel cosmic energy throughout my entire being in order to help others become enlightened.

(5) I am powerful beyond measure and use my unique power with love and humility.

(6) I live a healthy and spiritual lifestyle which keeps me connected to the divine nature of the universe.

(7) I am spiritual being having a physical experience. Therefore my true potential is deeply rooted in my spiritual nature."

ParamShivoham,2021-04-18 20:11:54+00:00,Meditation to enjoy everything including the self,"How to enjoy everything including the self?

It is so much joy. 

*You are the divine and all is divine too and that’s why you are absolute bliss*

Understand and cognise it. 

If it’s too difficult, just remember it by feeling it all day long

And see

Waking up after a good sleep is joy

Standing under the shower is joy

Breakfast is joy

The work bringing you money is joy

Bored? Tired? Fresh fruit juices/ coffee is joy. 

Music is joy. 

Just standing in the balcony or spending time in nature is joy

Sleeping in bed is joy. 

Boss behaving in angry ways? Ah keep remembering by feeling your joy. 

And within a few months, even the remembering by feeling drops too. 

Joy is constant. Enjoy 

Have fun 

Can a few moments or episodes of not joy kill someone like this? No

Such one’s joy will transform those things too

Just hold on a little bit longer 





Enjoy. Mind and body exist for the enlightened ones too. So enjoy them too 




Reading posts here and forgot? No worries. 

Now you remember? Cool. Remember by feeling again. You are divine and you are joy 

That’s what the crux of sanatan dharma is *Soham asmi*. 





A master just reminds you *Soham asmi*. Through his presence and words and techniques. 

If you can remember it, it starts merging in you. Now no master or scriptures required 

Enjoy 



Mind may tell you other things. Family may tell you other things. 

But you stay at your remembering by feeling the joy and the truth. That’s *tapasya* / penance . That’s being courageous 

much love and peace to you"
1canny,2021-04-18 19:54:46+00:00,Need some tips to get back to meditation,"A while back (actually longer than I do like to admit) I was meditating with consistence. Every day at least 20 min in the morning and some days more 20~30 min before sleep. I am diagnosed with ADHD and meditation was really helping me a lot. Not just I noticed that, but my parents and close friends too.
  Anyway, I live on apartment complex and ""a while back"" a new family moved in, thay have children and with the pandemics they play inside the apartment and since this happened I can't meditate anymore. Often while I was meditating, they start playing around the house, running, playing football.. whatever they were doing really disturbed my meditation schedule and unfortunately instead of relaxing I ended up getting stressed with it. 

I know this is actually my fault, since I should not let external things disturb my inner self. I think the ADHD may contribute with it ( but I don't want this to become an excuse ), cause literally anything can disrupt my attention.

So I was wondering if anyone here has been through this or have some nice advice for a desperate being.

Grateful for you attention and input. kisses of light."

Happy-Marzipan5478,2021-04-18 19:35:59+00:00,Random thoughts during audio,"
Hey,

I was listening to a meditation yesterday about getting a person to commit and I thought it might help to bring back a guy into my life. 

Next thing as I was listening some voice was like saying she wants to go on a date as if they were confused and then the next thing it said oh she’s just a plain Jane.

I was really hurt by this as I don’t think this person thinks I’m that but I also have a lot of doubts about this person he negged me once and I’ve felt insecure around me in the past.

So today I noted the time I heard the voice and I tried to listen to see if it would say the same thing because I already have a voice in my ear that whispers at the same time same things every day. I thought I heard the voice saying plain Jane before but not sure.

So I tried to carefully listen and it didn’t say those things and now I’m even more disappointed because I feel like it was him that said it. I’m empathic and I feel emotions and then I’m always on the empaths thread or some psychic thread and people telling me it’s real and then my self esteem does a nose dive."

I got a question regarding social phobia and vipassana.  I am suffering a lot from social anxiety and extreme insecurity. This is limiting my life in so much ways. It’s horrible. ☹️ I tried a lot to overcome it. But nothing really works. 
I read from a few people here that they overcame it with vipassana or meditation. So 4 weeks ago I made a online vipassana course where you meditate for 10 days. 4 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the evening. They recommend after the course to mediate further 2  hours per day. Which I am doing. 
But unfortunately my social anxiety is not better at all. 
I am doing  anapana in the morning and than Vipassana in the evenings. I got really strong sensations when I am doing Vipassana. Especially in my shoulders. All together it is really overwhelming. 
Now I am asking myself if it would be better to just do anapana and skip the Vipassana for a while. 
What do you meditators think what is best overcoming social phobia? Or do you have any other tips? 

I am very grateful for your responses! 🙏🏻"

Sviat-Hni,2021-04-18 11:36:45+00:00,The top meditation exercise that helped me reduce anxiety,"Hey there, meditation community!

During 2016-2018 I've been struggling with depression, constant dramatic mood shifts, and anxiety. I've been trying different methods to deal with my suffering, but what eventually helped me get back on track in life was, surprisingly, 20th-century French existential philosophy.

The more novels and essays I've been reading, the merrier I was rediscovering the joy of being alive.

I started organizing reading clubs with my friends, who also shared a passion for philosophy. We have been discussing the texts, and every time we would also write a short summary of the most valuable ideas of those prominent thinkers in the form of practical exercises.

I understand that most of you might not have time for 1000+ pages of philosophical tractates, as they are both enormous and hard to read.

Below is a version of the exercise we have written, and it is also the one I use every morning. I put it in a straightforward and concise form of guidance as if you were talking with the existential philosopher Sartre.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Hello there! My name is Jean-Paul Sartre, I'm a 20th-century French philosopher, and I will guide you through the world of existentialism.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Our goal here is to connect you with your inner sense of existence and help you create your own unique art of being alive.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Today we will examine one of my claims which is usually referred to as central in existentialism: 'Existence precedes essence'.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*To begin with, let me explain what essence means.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*For example, when a manufacturer creates a knife - he has in mind the concrete idea and purpose for it: to cut paper. Thus, the knife's essence comes before it exists. The knife has a predetermined meaning.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*With human creatures, on the contrary, the process is vice versa.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*We are beings that come into existence before we can be defined by any concept of it. There was no purpose for us until we were born.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Thus, for us existentialists,* ***the existence*** *of the human is the starting point.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*In our daily lives, we often use labels of various kinds to describe who we are. When we introduce ourselves, write posts on social media, etc. For example, I am an American, I am a designer, I am a traveler, I am an introvert, and so on...*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Eventually, we get so attached to these tags that we cannot view ourselves without them.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*Today, however, I want you to grasp the feeling of your existence without any connection to those labels. Let's do an exercise for that.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;***Exercise:*** *For a moment, try to forget about all the details about who you are. Take a deep breath. Touch your skin. Look around. Repeat to yourself:* ***I am.*** *Take a deep breath again and try to find that feeling of* ***being****. Once you catch it - stay with this idea that* ***you are here*** *for a bit. Smile at the fact of your very own existence.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*This sense of existence is what I want you to start your days with.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*You have to remember - before any of the labels, tags, responsibilities come - you are here.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*You are the process of being.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*We often forget about it and perceive potential risks and situations as the 'end of our lives'.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*For example, if I lose a lot of money, if my boss will fire me, if my girlfriend breaks up with me...*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*But remember, whatever happens -* ***you are still here****.*  
   
&gt;  
&gt;*As long as there is breath, anything is still possible.*  
 

Glad you read till this point:) Hope you still have the energy for some closing remarks.

I have written more lessons like that. Let me know if you are interested in it, so that so I can share more exercises later.

Topics I cover are the ones I've been struggling with most and found some answers for in philosophical texts: meaning of life, freedom, responsibility, anxiety, and many others.

The lessons are based on the primary sources of wisdom from more than 2500 years of history of philosophy, from Plato, Aristotle, Lao Tzu to Albert Camus, Viktor Frankl, and even Nassim Taleb or Jordan Peterson."

When I finish the meditation I go back to life and the drive all comes back, along with the problems. I'm less attached but it's still there.

But if you can meditate all the time, like a Monk, wouldn't you just let go of everything at all times? Then why would you do anything? You'd be okay with doing nothing, or everything. But what motivates you to choose? What do you choose when you're not attached to any option?"

Mqlskdjfhg,2021-04-18 07:52:10+00:00,Breathing/out of breath,"I've been taking meditation seriously for the past 2 years, as it seems to be the only thing that helps me to live with chronic abdominal pain.

I've started with a 10 day Goenka Vipassana retreat, and I've been doing vipassana meditation for the past 1,5 years. The results were discouraging. However, I've stumbled across Shinzen Youngs technique of ""zooming in/out"" on pain a couple of months ago. I've been focussing on and around the pain ever since, and I've noticed the abdominal pain migrating during meditation around my body, almost always from abdomen to chest (which is good, chest pain is highly preferable over abdominal pain in my case).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been experiencing that my breath deepens, slows down, as I put my attention on the migrating pain. Lately however, I've noticed that a conflicting ""choice"" arising: either I put my attention on the pain, either I give in on the rising need to breathe in.   
Now I'm trying to notice what is happening, (all without acting in on them): 

1. noticing the migrating abdominal/chest pain,  
2. noticing breathing deepening, become slower,  
3. noticing need to breathe/have oxygen,   
4. noticing thoughts about ""choice"": do I continue focusing on the pain, or do I give in to the need to breathe? (Note that for some reason, putting my attention on the pain conflicts with/prevents the ""choice"" to  breathe in!)  
5. noticing my hearts starting to beat faster,  
6. noticing my body starting to 'convulse' as it's in need for oxygen,

Eventually, for obvious reasons, I notice that I do breath in, usually a big inhale, followed by exasperated in-and exhales, after which I calm down, and the whole process starts over again.

Now I've been trying to go back to Goenka style body sweeps, and I've noticed the same thing: putting my attention on a bodily sensation conflicts with the need to breath somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal?"

When I meditate I have thoughts that disrupt my focus, I go back to focusing on my breath to be in the moment, but, the entire time I have a 'background thought' which is usually music playing in the back of my head and I cannot make it stop.

 It's like having 2 separate layers of thoughts, one I can control, one I cannot. It feels like it's in the back of my mind, too.

You may wonder why i say this but keep reading and know the truth from my experience. Sadhguru and his yogis enter my body every day and minuplated me in many ways making me feel like a human experimant. They disconnect parts of my brain and connect it in ways to make my mind work against me in unexplainable ways making me anxious for hours. They use this technique and drain parts of my brain making me brain dead and to make me not be able to write about the truth every day. Sadhguru and isha yoga center yogis and monks also minuplate my emotion first by making me happy for minutes but its just a trick, i remember sadhguru saying if you work hard on somebody they can make you believe anything they wish and then they start minuplating my mind with new connections pushing my mind wishing i was dead and attempt suicide then they try to help me and play their trick on me again. One may wonder why i have fallen for this trick but it is simple, the simple answer is they keep disconnecting my mind till it i can't generate another thought and make me forget everything they did so i started writing notes talking about how they minuplate my daily life to not fall for this trap once disconnecting my mind. Sadhguru and isha yoga center use this technique before i meet with people trying to embarrass me in front of others and at my work place making me incapable of living a normal life generating my thoughts with energy and pushing on my brain daily so i had to give up living and had to write this for the world to see. Sadhguru and isha yoga center play also with my physical body as if the mind was not enough, they control my facial expression and my energy in ways any sane person would be startled to hear my story. They kept disconnecting my brain as i wrote this passage so im sorry if by the end of the truth if i am unable to continue but i am trying my best to let the truth be heard. I am a regular person not a guru nor a yogi but once a seeker of truth and tried to protect myself by messaging other yogis and gurus for their help from Sadhguru and Isha yoga centers evil wishing their was an escape but if it doesnt work this message will be sent. Sadhguru and isha yoga center also have minuplated me in a way where they press on parts of my brain making me say what they want. I have learned so much about the mind these past few months they have been killing me as sadhguru once said the best way to kill someone is by keeping them half alive that i can explain and tell everyone everything what they have done to me"

hr0rrik,2021-04-18 01:53:37+00:00,A Mindful Moment,"Today I found myself filled with adrenaline, driving down the highway listening to metal, and re-imagining outcomes of traumatic experiences from my past. I was enthralled with the experience of feeling hate and the anticipation of violence. I played the same song over and over again, reliving this negative experience with an imaginary outcome over and over again. It was only because I had to pause to hit the replay button that I had time to think and even find the insight that I did. As I paused to hit the replay button, I realized the gravity of what I was doing. I was forcing myself to experience this delusion and using music to amplify the feeling and give it weight. I think I always knew this to some extent, but never really acknowledged its significance. 

Today I realized that what I was doing was unfair to myself. In escaping the reality of my experience, I deny myself the significance of the event and the opportunity to grieve for what actually transpired. 

I was also distraught because I realized my relationship with certain music was harmful.

I was sad because I didn't want to give up that music because of the way It made me feel.

I was sad because I realized that my attachment wasn't necessarily to the music but to the experience of anger or hate that music provided for me.

And finally I now feel grateful, because I am aware of this cycle and I am more aware of the need to find catharsis and not give in to escapism."

KundalinirRZA,2021-04-18 01:28:50+00:00,Every cell in the human body emits a unique frequency and your brain puts out a frequency which can be picked up by other brains.,"
It can pass through anything because It basically is the same frequency type that a radio transmitter puts out. 

The frequency that you're transmitting from your brain is smaller, but, it has a unique characteristic, unlike radio frequencies.

Which is that the frequency that your brain transmits can instantaneously travel faster than the speed of light and if transmitted can be picked up the exact same moment by another human brain on the opposite end of the planet. 

(Energy and frequency are the same.) Everything on planet Earth emits a different frequency. A frequency is also called a vibration. It's also called Energy. It is quantifiable and it is measurable. Every atom emits a frequency. Your DNA at the lowest level emits a unique frequency.

So your brain is a receiver and a transmitter a frequency. That's the first concept and the second concept is the Law of attraction. Which says, whatever frequency you emit, That exact same frequency is drawn to you. There will be a magnetic pull.

And this is a scriptural principle. For those of you who are Christians, Jewish, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists. All these books teach very similar Concepts. What you sow, also you reap. 

When you put out a frequency the Law of attraction says it must come back. Law of Attraction says by magnetic pull that has to bring that exact same frequency back. Which is based on whatever vibration you put out Whatever frequency that your brain, emotions, body and electromagnetic field puts out. It will attract and it will defy any physical law.

Self-induced goosebumps, from positive stimulis, allows you to take 100% control of your transmitter by vibrating different parts of your body, and is also able to, as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot) vibrate your whole physical body. 

When doing so, you consciously activate your physical and spiritual body to attract whatever intention, narrative, thought and emotions that are present when
consciously summoning your self-induced goosebumps.

Goosebumps is just the physical reaction, but underneath it, theres a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as Energy.

I've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.

If you would like to know how to activate at will, fully control your Spiritual Chills and how its an important ingredient to the law of attraction, Here's a five minute video explaining just that. [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ddnMkgT9c1g) ."

I've found that this is quite common among people with health anxiety specifically, but what I haven't been able to find is meditation that doesn't focus on the breath.

Zac_Jackson,2021-04-18 00:01:25+00:00,Open and Balance Your Root Chakra and release negative energy into the earth," The [Root Chakra](https://youtu.be/FRv3WWCVP4I) is the oldest of our seven major energy centers and having a blockage in this Chakra can be highly problematic.   

A strong root chakra provides connection with the earth, stability and grounding. Healing your roots will help you simultaneously unblock and energize any other chakras that are blocked or depleted.   From improving creativity to overcoming fear (a manifest product) to an increased sense of purpose, 

unlocking your roots is the first step in achieving balance in all aspects of life.  

You can open your Root Chakra by following this meditation technique:

  1. Sit with your shoulders back and your spine straight. Try to relax all your muscles as you close your eyes and breathe deeply. Inhale through the nose, pulling the breath as far down into your body as you can, and exhale through the mouth.  

2. Turn your attention to the base of the spine. This is where your root chakra is located. Notice any tightness in that area. As you exhale feel the tension releasing.  

3. Visualize a glowing red light at the base of your spine. Notice how the entire area around the base of your spine becomes warm and relaxed. Rest in this sensation for 3-5 minutes.  

4. Repeat these affirmations: 

 (1) I am a child of the Divine nature of the universe.  

(2) I and grounded and have built a solid foundation for my being upon the earth.  

 (3) I am wonderfully and fearfully made. 

 (4) My root chakra is balanced and energy flows through it naturally and harmoniously.  

(5) I am powerful beyond measure and use my unique power with love and humility. 

 (6) I live a healthy and spiritual lifestyle which keeps me connected to the divine nature of the universe. 

 (7) I draw strength from the earth using my root chakra which helps me to release negative and unwanted energy from my body.  

5. When you’re ready, slowly open your eyes. Sit for a few minutes before continuing with your day. Do this everyday for 5-10mins."
esmo999,2021-04-17 23:30:46+00:00,~~Ego~~,"I started meditating last year and it really helped me with my anxiety, health and outlook on life. 
Ego is a feature I like reminding myself about, as my ego was on a good level when having an good meditating routine. I felt one with everything and everyone, no invisible hierarchy.

(I started using Instagram again around the same time when I stopped mediating)

Social media is extremely toxic for me and I know for a lot of people, whether it’s subconscious or not. It’s an addictive app and through scrolling at people’s appearances, social gatherings, opinions etc it feels overwhelming and I (personally) compare myself to ‘prettier’, ‘cooler’ people and so that is why I am no longer looking at it. 

.It’s lame to pretend to be someone you’re not.

I’m grateful for people who are authenticity themselves, it’s inspiring and I shall make an effort to surround myself with those individuals.

I would consider myself fairly, I’d do my morning routine flawlessly, keep my place tidy 99% of the time, never smoked at work, always only after. 

I smoke weed and treat it as my company, I moved to the states to save up for early retirement and move back home. I find weed comforting and calming. Im also a big over-thinker and weed has helped (maybe) a lot to let myself back track and see that everything is more than fine.

But I ask the question as because I find myself at crossroads, if weed is actually a good thing for me or I just convince myself that it is."

Hey guys,

I just listened to a meditation to get a specific person to commit to you.

The thing is I don’t talk to this person and I have had a bad experience with them in the past. I guess I just miss them and I thought that it might help them reach to me.

While I was listening to this audio a voice in my head was like does she want to go on a date. Then a few mins later oh she’s just a plain Jane. I was devastated really I was. I don’t consider myself one at all and I hate the word average.

I have a lot of doubts towards this person I don’t believe that he is that attracted to me. I feel like he makes me insecure when I was around him and I never got to know him as a person. I guess I felt like he was out of my league. 

We mostly talked through text he used to act all charming and compliment me and then we had a fight and one of my coworkers came into work and asked me if I ever heard of a medium beautiful person. I instantly realized he was talking about the guy because I think he was using my co worker as a flying monkey. 

I don’t know if this is in my head. I already had a psychosis episode last year when I thought I did telepathic seduction on him and it back fired and I thought I could hear his voice insulting me and telling me I’m too skinny for him. I’m empathic I can sense emotions I thought before I could hear though from messages but no I can’t because I’ve posted on here and the schizophrenia thread and they said it’s all in my head."

It changed my life and helped me in many ways. I did it mainly for focus to help with my mild ADHD. Just focusing on my breath and letting thoughts come and go. At first I slept great. But as time went by I noticed my sleep getting worse. I would just lie there wired and awake, basically just resting. Also I would dream but in a state where I’m not in a deep sleep. I would wake up mid dream consistently. Dream then wake. Dream then wake. I’ve always been a light sleeper but could get consistent sleep once I’m asleep. I quit meditating for a month now which I’m not happy about but the lack of sleep is taking it’s toll on me. My sleep has gotten only slightly better meaning I’m not completely wired and not sleeping at all but I wake up numerous times a night still. I’ve practiced trying to move as little as possible. Also not being stressed about sleeping just letting it be. I just feel I may be one of those rare sensitive people similar to others who posted the same issue.

And by pursuing this method of relaxation, are you not protecting that needless life? 

Physical exhaustion is understandable. If you work physically hard throughout the day, the body is tired. But when you talk of these methods of meditation and the relaxation associated with them, you are talking of mental relaxation, right? 

Why is your life such that your mind is tired and bored and heavy? Why are you pursuing such a life and such a profession? Why is relaxation necessary at all? It’s man’s natural state to be relaxed.

The body can get tired, why is the mind getting tired? Why are you living that kind of life? If your body is tired and you want somebody to massage you, that’s alright. 

But if you say now, “My mind is tired”, then I will question the life that you are living, not ask you to meditate, not give you a method of relaxation.

Picture the room around you and focus on the fact that you are there alone, relaxing, with no one to disturb you.  You can also just picture an aura/forcefield or a box around you. If any thoughts intrude, practice the Vipsanna technique and observe it.  Don't judge it and let it pass.  This will help reduce anxiety by understanding that most of the things you think of are not real.  Picturing the radius helps you relax and understand that you are alone, that you should be one with your surroundings and the earth, and that it is your space to solely recover.  I've found this very useful as it eliminates intrusive thoughts, reduces anxiety, and also helps with improvement and understanding."

I usually meditate for 15 minutes in the morning, and 10 minutes mid-afternoon if I'm feeling scatterbrained.

I woke up today feeling really depressed and unmotivated. After a 10 minute meditation, my whole mindset seemed changed for the better. I feel dependent on meditating. Anyone relate to this or have thoughts?"
peaceiseverystepp,2021-04-17 14:45:42+00:00,Why we can't accept ourselves,"Have you ever wished that you were different, maybe you felt inadequate in some way or that you’re not quite enough for yourself or for someone else? It can be hard to shake that feeling, especially when things aren’t going to so well in work or in a relationship but we don’t have to be swept away by those thoughts into a negative spiral. 

We would all like to be comfortable in our own skin, but in the social media age it's not easy. There’s a lot of motivational messaging about being the best version of yourself, setting goals, don’t settle etc. This has the potential for creating a great deal of suffering because getting too attached to a goal takes us out of the only time and place where we can be happy, which is here and now. 

So how can we learn to accept ourselves? The first way is giving ourselves permission not to be perfect. Noticing when perfectionist and judgmental thoughts are arising, noticing them and looking deeply into them. Where do they come from, what experiences in our past give rise to us beating ourselves up when things aren’t going so well? Rather than acting on them, we can simply notice them entering and exiting our awareness, returning to the present afterwards.

The second way is to notice what it is about ourselves that we find hard to accept. We sometimes run away from this feeling and distract ourselves with food, alcohol and TV because we don’t want to face what we’re embarrassed about or ashamed of. An example from my own life is that I have social anxiety - for the first 30 years of my life I was really ashamed of that feeling. I fundamentally misunderstood why I was suffering, it was the shame rather than the anxiety that was causing the harm. Accepting the anxiety without judgement allowed me to let go of the shame and with that went the suffering. Of course I still sometimes feel anxiety in social situations but I accept that and can smile to it, saying “there you are my old friend”.  Accepting difficult feelings and being able to smile to them is a big step towards liberating yourself from suffering.

The final step to accepting yourself is having real conversations with other people. Not trying to be someone else, not trying to present a false version of who you are but being comfortable enough in your own skin to be open with who you are. That’s not necessarily easy because our experiences in life may have taught us that other people can’t be trusted but one of the key aspects of a happy life is surrounding yourself with other people that you can truly be yourself around. 

It can feel hard to believe that if you accept who you are that other people will too but people are more attracted honesty and realness than either someone having a grandiose narrative about themselves or self-deprecation.

sowmi245,2021-04-17 14:35:38+00:00,Known and Unusual Benefits of Meditation," Meditation benefits not only your mind but also your body and soul. Meditation Benefits It has numerous advantages that would take a whole book to write about. Here I will mention the most important benefits and the most overlooked benefits that meditation provides.

**The Most Important Benefits of Meditation**

It is very useful to read about meditation benefits if you are still unsure whether you want to start meditating. These benefits will help you decide if meditation can contribute to your well-being and improve other aspects of your life.

**1. Meditation improves your focus**

One of the greatest meditation benefits is its ability to increase your focus. Once you start meditating, you will be able to effortlessly concentrate on any work you do without getting distracted.

That will make a huge difference in your life as you will significantly increase your productivity. You will be much more successful than the average person who cannot sit still for more than 5 minutes.

**2. Meditation makes you aware of your thoughts**

During meditation, you will need to focus on silence. That means that you will be able to spot your thoughts as soon as they come in. This will give you an opportunity to judge your own thinking. For example, you will be able to check if the majority of your thoughts are positive or negative.

You should not be surprised if you find the latter to be true because negative thinking is almost a default thinking for the majority of people.

**3. Meditation reduces stress**

Meditation almost instantly reduces stress as soon as you start practicing it. This is because during meditation your whole mind is cleansed from negative thoughts. You can sometimes even feel the cleansing process whilst meditating. When you feel energy circling in your head, it means that the intensive cleaning process is taking place. It is a very interesting feeling, I must say:)

So when your mind becomes purer, you will have fewer negative thoughts. As a result of this meditation benefit, you will not be suffering from thoughts of worry and fear.

Of course, you will not be able to get rid of all negative thoughts you have (especially if you keep introducing new negative thoughts after meditation). However, if you constantly meditate, your main mental state will remain positive.

**4. Meditation develops patience**

If you meditate daily, you will remain calm and positive during the times when most people lose patience. For example, waiting in a queue will no longer be of concern to you. When you are stuck in traffic, you will feel as good as when you spend your time at home.

**5. Meditation gets you into a state of joy**

Another great meditation benefit is that sometimes you will become happy for no reason. Your surroundings will look magical and you will see everything in different colors. Such a state of joy will usually last just for a minute or so, but with time this will increase.

Being in a state of joy means that you will see yourself as a very happy person. You will perceive your life to be without any problems. Whilst you are in a state of joy, the positive energy inside you will look for ways to express itself. Therefore you will be able to express it any way you wish. You may think of doing something creative, pursuing your goals, or spending time doing something you really like.

**6. Meditation helps you achieve inner peace**

One of the meditation benefits is clearing your mind from negativity. Because of that, you will become peaceful as there will be fewer worrisome thoughts left in you. You will notice a huge difference once you develop inner peace. This will feel like stillness inside you. Even if someone tries to upset you or make you angry, you will not give in because you will be strong inside.

External circumstances and events will affect you less because your main concentration will be inside you, rather than outside. You may still get a bit emotional on the outer level, but deep inside you will remain still and peaceful.

**7. Meditation detaches you from negative emotions**

During meditation, your mind is cleared of useless thoughts. As fewer negative thoughts will be left in your mind, you will experience fewer negative emotions. This is because all your emotions result from thoughts.

Besides that, even if you still feel negative emotions, they will not affect you greatly. This is because during meditation you will be able to observe your thinking. Once you think about something negative, you will be aware that you had a negative thought. The thought will not have control over you as you will spot it before it could overwhelm you with some emotion.

**8. Meditation makes you aware of emotional harm**

This is a great meditation benefit. With the practice of meditation, you will be able to feel what harm your negative emotions do to your body, mind, and soul. This new awareness will make you wonder if you want to get into the negative state again and therefore you will avoid arguments and other harmful situations.

You will also become more sensitive to the energies of other people. You will sense from a distance if a person is angry, upset, or happy. That will benefit you greatly because you will know which person is better to be around. By only being with positive people you will avoid being dragged down into low emotional states**.**

**The Most Overlooked Meditation Benefits**

These meditation benefits may or may not apply to you.  
Meditation Benefits It depends if you are interested in becoming more conscious and aware of the universal laws as well as higher consciousness.

Even if you are not interested in the subjects above, it might be worth reading the rest of the article so that you would not miss out on something beneficial.

**1. Meditation makes you connected with the universe**

This is an amazing meditation benefit. When you practice meditation, you start feeling connected to everything in this universe. You understand not only human beings, but other forms of life, like animals. I do not mean to say that you will understand their communication methods :) However, you will be able to sense how they feel.

You will feel the emotions of animals when you pay close attention to their behavior. So when an animal is scared, you will feel the fear he has. I find this ability amazing because then you can sense when animals are happy and express compassion when they feel upset.

When you start understanding how they feel, you will look at animals in a different way. You will no longer see them as external beings that are complete strangers. You will feel a connection with them at some level. And that connection is the consciousness that we all have.

Because of this meditation benefit, you will understand nature better. You would not tear a leaf off a plant, for example, because you will know that plants can feel the pain.

**2. Meditation raises your consciousness**

Meditation naturally raises your consciousness because you start seeing the true colors of life. You see an abundance of everything rather than lack, you feel that the world is going into harmony rather than getting deeper into chaos.

You start understanding the truth. Instead of relying on media for information (which is almost always depressing and false), you find all the answers in your consciousness.

**3. Through meditation you connect with the universal mind**

That is one of the best meditation benefits that I have found. Once you are used to meditation and you have made it into your daily practice, you will experience the flow of ideas at some times.

For example, you need to come up with some business idea and but cannot think of anything. All you should do is to ponder on that for a while asking yourself 'What are the best business ideas I can think of?'

After that just let go of this thought and meditate at normal times. You will notice soon that you start getting business ideas from different sources. You may read a book and some words will catch your attention and you will realize that this is a great topic for your business project. Such an idea may come in a form of your thought. Or some friend might introduce some idea that you can apply for your business.

The ways ideas from sources can reach you are really unlimited. Just be open to receive them by being aware of what is happening around you.

**4. Meditation removes obstacles for manifestations**

When you visualize and try to manifest your desires, meditation practice will be of great help.

Meditation eliminates most of your negative thinking. Negative thoughts are nothing more but limited beliefs that you kept reinforcing until they became unconscious. So once you get rid of them, they will not block your desired manifestations from reaching you because there will be no external forces clashing with your positive intention.

**5. Meditation raises your vibration**

Meditation benefits you immensely in raising your vibration. After you finish meditating, your vibration might fall a bit, but if you practice meditation constantly, your entire vibration will be raised.

When you get into the higher vibration you become a vibrational match for positive circumstances and events in your life. This is because by raising vibration you change yourself into a more positive, loving, peaceful, and happy person.

Meditation is also the first step towards opening up to different frequencies. This can help if you want to experience other dimensions, communicate with spirits or understand the universal mind better. As I did not reach this level (nor am I trying to at this moment), I cannot be more specific as to how exactly this can be achieved.

**Conclusion**

Meditation is practiced by millions of people because it provides numerous advantages that everyone can benefit from. The great thing about meditation is that you do not have to be an expert in meditation to start feeling the benefits it provides.

After a week of meditation, you will start seeing and sensing first meditation benefits like reduced stress, inner peace, and inner strength. When you keep meditating for longer, you will notice much more benefits including the ones that I have mentioned in this article.

_melbatoast_,2021-04-17 14:24:10+00:00,New benefit for me.,"Not entirely new, but I went through a stretch of non mediation and lost this for a time.

I work in a field that has a lot of employee dramatics and I’ve never been good at navigating these situations. If anything, my attempts to avoid them would always make things worse. Over the last few months I’ve had 4 circumstances where I easily could have fallen into those dynamics but I just didn’t. I saw them happening and just didn’t respond at all.

The interesting thing to me is that it wasn’t that I did something, or added anything to change the dynamic. I just noticed the trigger, made a decision to not participate, thought about what my attention should be focused on, and then moved into that.

Normally I would be concerned about how I look in these circumstances. Would people see my side/sympathize with me? The thought came up and was replaced with a feeling I had no control over that, and the thought left.

There was a pause of time between my decision to not participate and the results to become palpable. I think this lapse exists no matter how I move in the world. Normally it’s a highly anxious time for me, but now I’m just noticing the lapse exists.

I also noticed that after that lapse, my relationships/interactions (as a whole) had a warmer/softer quality to them. It was subtle but noticeable. 

I can’t say I will never fall into these types of traps again. I just wanted to share it before I forget it."

ExamRepresentative10,2021-04-17 13:55:25+00:00,Mysterious overwhelming energy flow in my body I can activate whenever I want,"Hello all!

A few years ago, when I first started meditating, I was deep, deep in a meditation session when a huge euphoric wave went across my whole body and was sustained for some time. Honestly it freaked me out at first, but ever since then I’ve been able to activate the energy whenever I want, easily and without even being in a meditative state.

It feels like my whole body is electric, my muscles twitch often and it’s like it’s controlled through my pelvis weirdly enough. Almost orgasmic? But way too overwhelming to sit with for more than a minute or two.

My question for years - what the hell is it? It’s not unpleasant at all and sometimes even cleansing. I’ve tried google searching so many times to know avail- this last time led me to Kundalini- which feels incorrect. What do you guys think?"

Sisyphusarbeit,2021-04-17 12:20:59+00:00,"""I want to start, but don't have the time.""","That's the most funny thing that someone, who wants to start to meditate, can say.   
Just let this absurdity sink in.

Isn't the whole point of meditation to slow down? To be present and perhaps to even prepare for death?

""Nature Does Not Hurry, Yet Everything Is Accomplished."" - Lao Tzu

Meditation is a tool we use to stay present. To be here, to simply just be. Nothing more.   
Some say the goal is to ""free"" yourself or to become detached. Yet, the goal is to simply focus on the now.

Meditation is not magic, it's not pseudo science, it's a way to controll your consciousness and your doing. By simply closing your eyes and listening to your breath, you start to realize the present moment. There is no higher being awaiting you.

Yesterday I've read a post here about someone ranting that he feels like mediation doesn't change anything for him, that he has tried everything and that it simply does not help him to become ""free"" or ""detached"" and that he's trying for so long.

Well, this person did not get the point of meditation. You don't meditate to achieve anything. You do not meditate and get something in return, understand that. Meditation does not  guarantees you anything. It's not a service you pay for or a promise that anything ever will change.

Meditation is a tool you use to come to realization. With meditation you simply just are."

How do you deal with loss of mother or someone who's most important to you in your life?

My mother got breast cancer 2yrs ago and even tho it was late she was so powerful to deal with it then after taking her breast and getting chemichal treatment which she got extremely in pain for it (like it aged her 20 yrs more) but after getting cured a few months later she got liver cancer was getting chemichal treatment but few weeks back we heard she isn't eating anything and her blood was kinda poisoned from chemichal treatment so she was always in hospital in an extreme pain my siblings were so worried for her and kept  watching over her while i afraid of her death only was saying it's ok and afraid being negative and thinking of her death wasn't visiting her a few times i tried tho but either she was resting or wasn't recognizing me since she was so much in pain and all these time hungry and thirsty.
Probably only once she recognized me and talked while in all that pain until last night my siblings asked me to watch over her in hospital when i went i was so worried since she had all sort of wires attached to her delicate body and was drooling in pain while had to much morphin and definitely was hellucinating the whole time and after a while she was opening her mouth like a fish. You can't imagine how hurting it was for me and worse was how much pain she was in to addition to whatever she was going through in all these weeks. But bastard nurse kept telling me her breath is okay we switched places with my siblings and a few hours later while i checked if shes okay my sister while sobbing told me mother doesn't hv breath and she's under a device. I went crazy and started having thoughts in mind of my sister screaming to me mother is dead. 

I always did my best to not worry since childhood this was my biggest fear but i never talked about it to her or anybody so i wouldn't attract it. So with all the shakes i had last night i kept telling myself its gonna be okay but couldnt rest all i did was prayinh helpless so today early morning my brother told said she is gone since last night.

She was most inportant person to me and sadly i always was so depending towards her. Did alot including coocking for us in this situation i always felt useless not being able to give her a comfortable life i mean we live in a financially awful country but still and all this time wasnt visiting her and couldn't do anything for her kept me with feeling of extreme guilt. After 5 yrs i started getting inspired again to do a project and work again i was really getting a lot of that lately and after almost finishing my first one hoping it would work and wanted so bad to show the good results to her i heard that she is dead

I don't feel like living anymore i feel like i lost everything and everyone. It's so enpty without her and i couldn't even tell her i love her so much i was so crazy about her liver cancer that asked my family to tell the doctor if they could do aliver surgury i'mwilling to give her mine and die but this is worse that dying. I feel like crying all the time can't eat.

Can anyone help me to deal with this?"

lookingforhappy,2021-04-17 03:58:58+00:00,Need some kind of meditation that I can SEE,"Okay I’ve been meditating on and off for about 9 years now. The only time I’ve felt any benefit is when I’ve done it consistently, which I have an extremely hard time doing. I have ADHD and it’s really difficult to sit and meditate for even short periods of time. What’s more frustrating is I only feel like my mind starts to calm down around the 10 minute mark, so if I do any less than that I don’t find the experience very enjoyable or calming (which then dissuades me from doing it again the next day).

The only thing I find helpful, for whatever reason, is these breathing exercises with visual cues (such as breathe in, breathe out, hold). It’s not exactly meditation because it involves controlling the breath instead of just watching it, but regardless...it helps. Are there are other sorts of “visual” meditations like this where I can watch something? Even guided meditations don’t work for me because I can’t pay attention for long and end up daydreaming for most of it. Audio cues don’t catch my attention but visual cues do.

I’m afraid that there are so many hidden gems and benefits to meditation that I’m missing because I can’t get myself to practice every day, and I need a way to make it a little less boring and more engaging for myself. Any advice you can give is greatly appreciated!"

But in the series it talks about animals greeting us as a recently passed away individual, causing us to reach relief or forgiveness of the individual that passed away.  

I was sitting in my garage one day and a meditative state and asked the universe or whoever listening that if my mom's ex-fiance that passed away was still out there I want him to greet me as a cardinal before spring.  I don't want it to be a sign as a cardinal just flew by me I want more. 

Today was 40° and it snowed and rained most of the morning.  This morning it was snowing and two birds landed on the tree outside my window. One a sparrow and one a cardinal.  My first glance I didn't think much of it but it's cold and early in the season for a cardinal.  I literally responded out loud to my wife is that a damn cardinal? As I glanced again the tree has blooms on it.d

Needless to say I was true denial the whole time it was outside my window.  Even though it would dance on that damn branch and stared at me.  

Today I was practicing four rounds of the Wim Hof method and plowing into a deep meditation state asking the universe of nothing, just listening, tell me anything.  

It felt like I was in a circle of stones and I was being danced around by some sort of shaman Indians with fire occasionally behind them, playing some sorts of instruments.  There are no words exchanged at this time but I could feel the presence flashing in my mind of the cardinal intermittently changing to my mom's ex-fiance's face.  I could feel a low frequency drum asking me something but I could not understand.  

I glanced at the snow and said there's no way then glancing back at the bird it would flash back to these people drumming louder as if it was drumming my soul.  It became so loud something said what more did you want?  

I'm in denial at this point because I have so much sorrow when I die I just want the pain to stop.  But all I could feel was a wave come over me of something powerful taking control with this music.  I stopped and raised my voice with these individuals and said no i want the Cardinal to land on my hand! 

The music stopped one of the people stared at me as if it was my wighted blanket caressing my soul and said you've had everything you wanted but you still don't believe.  

I just started crying.  I don't know why I thought of this sub but what or why me? Can't we all just die and sleep in peace? 

I don't know what this means for me or my beliefs or why I'm even telling Reddit. But I thought I'd share my story."

Zac_Jackson,2021-04-16 23:28:23+00:00,Open and balance you third eye chakra. Tap into our psychic abilities.,"When we talk about the energy centers in our body, there are seven major ones: Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Throat, Third Eye and Crown.   

The third eye is located between the eyebrows on a horizontal plane across the face.   It has been called a spiritual gateway connecting us to divine wisdom and higher power.  

 When it's open people have more intuition and psychic abilities; they're better able to communicate their true feelings; they can be more creative; they find solutions easier and are naturally drawn towards what's good for them instead of what makes them feel bad or avoidant of something unpleasant in life.   

How to open your third eye chakra with [meditation and music](https://youtu.be/G32njkkIqFU):  

1. Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight and your spine erect like an arrow pointing towards the sky.  

2. close your eyes. Bring your full attention to the area located between your eye brows. Notice thoughts and feelings as they come and go. Just notice that they are there. Do not attach just notice them and acknowledge them.    

3. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Do this until you feel relaxed then let your breathing begin to happen naturally as you continue to pay attention to your the area where your Ajna is located.  

4. Remind your self that you are a spirit having a physical experience and that. Know that you possess psychic abilities that can be accesses and used to your advantage once your third eye opens. Use these abilities to do good in the world.  

5. Do this for at least five minutes everyday.  

Positive affirmations are also a good way to activate your third eye chakra. Here a few I came up with on my own.  

1. I am powerful beyond measure.  

2. I posses unique and special psychic abilities.  

3. I am spiritually awakened.  

4. My intuition guides me into places where my third eye chakra will stay balanced and open.  

5. My third eye enables me to see the absolute and utmost truth about my spiritual nature.  

6. I am a spiritual being having a physical experience.  

7. My psychic abilities are active and fully intact."

I don't want to further perpetuate these things that I thought were me because I know it they are all born from fear. I do want to cultivate new values, set personal boundaries, and be able to engage people from a place of strength, not appeasing them for my own safety.

However, it seems from my observation that people with the most steadfast values are strongly rooted in identifying with a concept. For example, someone who ""follows a vegan lifestyle"" is probably not going to put up as much of a fight as someone who ""***is*** vegan""

The times are pretty crazy. Finding some footing is becoming increasingly difficult with so much unpredictability and volatile energy flowing into our lives right now. It can be very stressful and unsettling, especially if you happen to be someone who has trouble dealing with it. It may have pounced on you recently with sudden vigor and totally f'd up your sh*t all at once, or you may be in a sustained, slow-burn of situational discomfort.

On the other hand, you may not have anything to complain about and you're just curious about it. It's actually the best time to start! If you wait until you're stressed to the gills and use meditation to pry some relief from the jaws of insanity you'll find it a lot more difficult.

No matter what your situation happens to be, I'd like to share a really great, simple methodology with you. There's no religion in it, no great wisdom. I'm not selling anything and I don't want anything from you at all. I'm not writing a book and have no plans to profit from this in any way other than to experience a little joy in helping people for its own sake.

I've got a background in it that goes back a few decades, so if you want to know about that we can discuss it, but I want to stress the simplicity of this thing. I'm not trying to be your guru and I don't consider myself to be anything more than a bit of buzzing consciousness much like everyone else.

Message me directly here on reddit if you'd like to come by, or you can just walk up and say hello if you can find me out on the beach in the Playa del Rey/Dockweiler area. I'll be there from around 730am until about 1130am. If I'm talking to someone, kindly let us have our time before you approach for the sake of privacy and keeping from disruption.

I usually do guided meditations from Spotify or free apps.  I started meditation to help with stress. My anxiety is generally manageable with 2-3 attacks each year for the last few years.  

I have done a few body scans(head to feet) in the past and really enjoy them.  I've found them to be really helpful in realizing where I'm holding tension and actually letting it go and relaxing.  2 days ago I went to do my daily meditation from an app, did a few minutes of breath focus so was feeling calm and relaxed when it started a body scan. This time starting at the feet and working up. I don't know why but I immediately felt quite upset. Focusing on the feet and legs I felt sort of trapped/almost claustrophobic, By the time I got to hips I felt like I was about to have a full anxiety attack. I didn't, but was definitely quite anxious and unsettled during and after.  It was a short meditation so not a lot of time to process my thoughts during this. 

I'm wondering if others have had similar experiences, is this normal? I'm not sure if it was just because the meditation was a bit different/new and I just need to keep trying it and practicing. Or if its more of a warning/there's things I should process before continuing with that type of practice, or just generally not a bad idea to take a step back?  Am I just completely overthinking it? I still feel a bit unsettled and am nervous to try again.  

Basically looking for any advice for anxiety happening during a meditation."
Iceberg63,2021-04-16 15:23:01+00:00,I experienced Equanimity,"I experienced a great peace in the middle of my usual practice today and it was out of the ordinary.

By the way, i do not qualify myself as an advanced practitioner yet. There are still many ups and downs that i experienced during my daily practice, but i have became very consistent recently.

I began practicing 10+ minutes of meditation along with reciting a handful of Buddhist mantras for around an hour intotal for 5 days a week and whenever i missed a session of practice, i'll re-schedule them for the weekend.

But there are still days where the practice was not adequately undertaken, sometimes when i was tired i'd fell asleep in the middle of the practice or misspelled the mantras or having my thoughts rumbling throughout the practice.  
There are times when i even began to question whether if the practice is at all healthy since i undergo them with a forceful attitude.

But there were also times when the practice brought peace and was undergone smoothly without drowsiness. Today was one of the practice that went smoothly.

And today i experienced a peace that i had never before during the practice. Though experiencing peace is fairly common during practices- the peace that i experienced today was very distinctive. The peace was very ""empty""ing.

In that experience of peace, everything no longer matters. This is what i sometimes experienced whenever i was in a heat situation and saw a glimpse of Buddha statue or thought about Buddha, there's this silent that extinguish everything. It's literally the depiction of the calmness of The Buddha's image.

Sometimes, in the middle of the practice there was this ""voice"" inside me that is telling me what to do and even nags me about what i did that i assumed ""wrong"". But at that moment, the voice no longer mattered.

It last for atleast 20 minutes long while i was reading a long mantra, and it did not even mattered to me anymore whenever i misspelled a word in the mantra (since i usually assumed that it is ""wrong"" to misspell mantras). It felt like i can be in the most heated situation and endure it with a smile in my face.

But it wasn't atall blissful like what many practitioner experienced during their meditation practice. There's not in the slightest a sensation of bliss/euphoria. But somehow the absence of bliss itself is blissful. There's no emotion, no excitement, no happiness, no pleasure and also no sadness, no grief, no anger, no discomfort, no unpleasentness.

I can feel that this is what the practice had come to fruition. And then suddenly i thought, ""This is what they call Equanimity"". I understand now why Monks and advanced practitioner always seem so ""Empty""."

I always felt that those who spoke about experiencing these words are merely bragging.

But after today's meditation, i understood what consciousness is. It was as if ""consciousness"" hit me/dawned upon me for the first time in my life. I experienced it for a few minutes before my mind got diverted. I understood then that consciousness too is a choice, something one should apply to into his life. I hope this is a first step to greater paths."

alanphil,2021-04-16 14:39:43+00:00,Music that Illustrates Focus,"I have had a meditation practice for over a decade and also enjoy creating music. For the last year I've been exploring writing and composing ambient music. I find it interesting how this genre of music can illustrate 'the mind working'.

Here is a track I've created recently. The title is 'from before' and I took the photo I used for the YouTube video on Mount Jiuhua in central China (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Jiuhua) in 2006.

from before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfHuRpy5SQo

How does this example of ambient music reflect the mind working? For the casual listener it may appear that nothing is happening in this music. It seems to be non-changing. If you listen deeply you can hear constant change in the drone-like tone. It is shifting in various ways and the changes that appear are also not constant. So from one side the observer can say 'nothing is changing with this music' but also the opposite is true 'there is constant change'. 

My meditation practice is in the Soto Zen tradition, and we don't typically sit with music playing. I still use this music to practice though - just not on the meditation cushion. I wanted to post this here in this reddit group in the hope that someone finds it interesting or useful to their practice."

Leading-Blueberry-31,2021-04-16 13:15:23+00:00,What are the ways to end loneliness?,"Depression is an indication of present-day times. In Medieval times, connections were less significant in light of the fact that individuals' strict confidence was a lot more prominent. An individual's relationship with the heavenly was a higher priority than human connections. With the decrease in strict confidence, there is a more prominent sensation of forlornness and distance. 

The savant Martin Heidegger said that what people fear the most is nothingness. Individuals dread being separated from everyone else. They dread quiet and void. Be that as it may, isolation can be a chance for otherworldly development. It can carry you nearer to God. Jesus was tried by being separated from everyone else in the desert for forty days. Moses was distant from everyone else on the peak for forty days. 

The scholar Nietzsche tormented by chronic weakness and disappointments in affection would go for long single strolls in the mountains or by the ocean to reestablish his life. It additionally motivated him to compose. The mathematician and thinker Blaise Pascal said man's misery is because of his failure to sit alone in a tranquil space for five minutes. Have a go at sitting alone in a peaceful spot. Close your eyes and stay there quietly for a couple of moments. Sit outside on a calm evening and gaze at the sky loaded up with stars. Free yourself up to the quietness of the universe. Hear God's voice in that quiet. God addresses us in our agony and forlornness.

After a little bit, my whole body felt kind of numb, and I kept seeing a flashing effect with my closed eyes. Then it felt light my body was almost rising from it's position and suddenly my ears felt tight and I heard a sort of ringing. Once the ringing passed, I heard white noise, almost like the sound of waves in the Ocean. I finally opened my eyes and I sort of felt out of breath, and let out a gasp. I thought it was sleep paralysis at first, (I've never experienced sleep paralysis but I've watched videos and stuff on it) but I could move, look around, and I could raise up from the bed. Throughout the entire experience, I didn't seem to dream or anything, in fact it felt like I couldn't let myself fall asleep at all, even though I had completely relinquished control of my body to whatever was going on, the main constants were the feeling of numbness, rising, and the flashing vision.

I've noticed just how subtle my thoughts can be.  When I'm meditating, these thoughts can creep in very quietly - and after a while, BAM, I have my a-ha moment and realise I've lost my attention on the meditation object.

And this is the same off the cushion.  I can slip into daydream mode or I can be made to feel anxious by my thoughts.  It's very interesting to watch this happen - especially the impact on my physical body - I may hunch my shoulders, drop me head or hold tension in my brow when I feel anxious.  This is all when I go 'internal' and am no longer present in the moment.

It's slow.  But it's steady.  This is how almost all change happens.

Few months back, i tried to meditate. From time to time, right before sleep, i placed myself on my back on my bed, relaxing, breathing and focusing on my breath only. Sometimes, i was able to achieve tingling in my feet and hand until i stopped feeling my limbs completely. If i were to continue and not fall asleep, i came to a state where there was pulses in my body. Waves of heat and excitement originating from my feet pulsing through my body to my head. 

It was to my surprise, during my last session, that those pulses were originating from my head and i could control them, holding them like a tension before orgasm and then releasing it with my mind.

I was later discussing it with my father that there is this place in the center of my head (between my ears) which, when focusing on it, i could make this excitement wave. During this conversation, i tried to do this again, fully awake and i succeeded. So every time i want, i can focus on that place and release a wave. If i hold it a little bit longer, i can feel tingling through my whole body.  


This is my question. What is it that i can do? What is this place in the center of my head?

Tired of trying to be wise when they haven't realized anything significant or gained any more peace than the average joe that's ''caught up in the world''.

I went through and practiced all the teachings and techniques of meditation, non-doing, just sitting, vipassana, mindfulness, inquiry. None of them benefitted me. I know what you're going to say, ''it's becouse you're looking for something to benefit you, that's why you etc etc''. Yes, I am looking for calm, I'm looking for peace. I'm not ashamed of that. 

I built up a hyper awareness that's so strong I can't function like a normal human being that's just being in the flow and going about their ''worldly'' business. Now there's an awareness that's always watching what I'm thinking, what I'm doing, and it's very irritating. Now, when doing something, it feels more forced and artificial. There's also more tension in my body. The ''flow'' state is now almost non-existent for me, becouse I'm always vigilant and never just doing an activity without any awareness, wheter it is walking, talking, anything.

My happiest moments are actually being on holidays, being with friends, basically not having a cultivated awareness or watchful eye. Being in the flow, without being guilty of it becouse ''it's inferior to enlightenment/nirvana/real happiness, bla bla bla''.

How would you approach this situation of mine. I know it is very complex becouse I tried and stopped trying everything. Also sorry for my english, it's not my native language."
creator267,2021-04-16 10:09:49+00:00,I have COMPLETE mental clarity and control over my life and emotions and it's scary.,"18M here been meditating for more than 2 years now. Engineering student and have perfectionist tendencies. 

I started out with the fact that I want to be the absolute best at what I study and learn and have complete clarity because I want to be the 'best engineer'. At the same time, I wanted to have the 'best body' because well, perfectionist tendency and it would make me feel good about myself. 

I slowly got into semen retention, chakra meditation where I was in a state of love all the time. Meat started affecting me and I left it and went vegan for a while. 

I started eating lesser and lesser. Now I don't feel hungry anymore. Have immense mental clarity. No attachment to food. But I've also lost all my emotions in the process. 

I don't feel like I live a normal life anymore. I don't get angry, sad, happy or horny. I'm simply emotionless. Yes, I have a lot of clarity. But I've lost my sleep. My mind is racing, thinking all the time about life, about things to do. 

I don't know if I even know who I am anymore. I feel emotionless. Suffering from identity crisis. 

How should  I feel about this?"

I’ve started meditating for a couple of months now to beat my anxiety and be more present. Anytime throughout the day when I notice that I’m thinking of future scenarios that cause me anxiety, I consciously stop the thought and bring myself to the present moment. However, isn’t this the same as fighting the anxiety instead of just passively letting the thoughts go by? Which in turn will cause me more anxiety?"

Z_Birch,2021-04-16 09:13:13+00:00,I had a great experience but I can’t really explain it. Maybe you guys can help ?,"So, I’ve been meditating for a while now. Mindfulness meditation, that is. 

Every morning I meditate in my garden in the sunlight. It’s great. 

I often feel a great sense of peace, sometimes even bliss. But this morning, became so intense.

I felt like some energy was running through my whole body. It was stronger and stronger, joy and incredible pleasure started overtook me. 

Also, I felt like my hands were « misplaced », they were resting on my knees but I was feeling them on the side of my body. 

Same thing for my arms, it’s as if they had disappeared. 

Also, as the pleasurable feeling started rising, I had a huge erection that felt really nice. (I kinda feel weird talking about that but it happened lol)

So, yeah, it was wonderful. But I’m curious as to what happened. 

I would love to have your insights."
chalimar,2021-04-16 08:19:47+00:00,"Something I learned about meditiation that makes it so hard to grasp for many people, including me.","At first glance, it seems logical that in order to gain profound insight, you need to dig deep. Do something special. Become an expert.

The thing with meditiation is that a lot of the profound insights that can be gained are in plain sight. They are right there, at the surface. But it's so alien to us that it seems to be the same as asking a person to ""just understand quantum physics"", even though that person has never heard of it before.

Sure, it probably helps to gain (a lot of) experience in meditation in order to gain those insights, but it's not a necessary requirement."

Although I’ve only been meditating for 2 weeks, I am noticing slight changes in my thinking patterns already. I was wondering if some of you who have been practising for a longer period can share their experience about how meditation affected your reactivity. I consider myself a very sensitive person and I’ve had patterns of reacting to things in the heat of the moment. Although I think I’ve come a long way, I know that there are still times I want to yell or break things or just give up on things completely. 

Has any of you who had similar behaviour patterns benefitted from meditation and like to share?

sowmi245,2021-04-16 07:42:56+00:00,what I have learned in the past 5 years of meditation,"In my personal life, I gain lots of purposes during meditation.

Preferences aside, there are certain benefits that all meditation techniques have in common, regardless of their specific practices. If you want to transform your life through stillness, these are the effects you can expect:

1. You Will Experience Less Stress

… And we could all do with a bit less of it, as judged by the increase in anxiety medication that’s being sold over the counter. When sitting down to do your practice on a regular basis, your brain will produce less cortisol, which is the ‘fight or flight hormone which we experience as stress. Furthermore, meditation allows us to regain control over our own emotions and nervous system by creating neurological pathways which help us center ourselves in the here and now and come back into our bodies when stress threatens to take over.

2. You’ll Crave More of What’s Good for You

Practitioners all over the world report that taking the time to sit down in the here and now has encouraged them to take better care of themselves. You’ll see that the discipline that comes with regularly employing meditation techniques will make you more inclined to nourish your body as well as your mind – which means more appetite for healthy food, less appetite for cigarettes and alcohol, and artificial flavors.

3. You’ll Be Able to Concentrate Better

A study by the journal Psychological Science, led by Katherine MacLean of the University of California, saw 60 participants sign up for a 3-month retreat during which they would spend at least 5 hours a day practicing meditation techniques. Before, during, and after the retreat, their mental performance was tested by means of a boring test that required the participants to focus intensely. Those who had been investing in regular training turned out to score much higher on the concentration front – something which you can also achieve by committing to your practice.

4. You Can Lower Your Blood Pressure

We all know that meditation is relaxing… but relaxing has actual cardiovascular benefits to it as well! It is known to increase the compound nitric oxide, which causes our blood vessels to open and, consequently, our blood pressure to drop.

5. You’ll Be More Likely to Be Happy

Meditation puts you on the fast track to being happy. Studies show that it increases brain activity in the left part of the brain’s prefrontal cortex – a center that is associated with positive emotions – whilst decreasing activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex – which causes us to feel negative emotions. And on top of all the other benefits, it brings you… what more is there to want?

Are you ready to start transforming yourself into a better, healthier, more focused you? Choose a meditation practice today and start feeling the benefits."

sowmi245,2021-04-16 04:57:13+00:00,How to Meditate: 10 Meditation Techniques," *Benefits of Meditation*:

\* Greater clarity of thought

\* More peaceful states of mind

\* Enhanced ability to concentrate

\* Increased creativity and intuition

If you're new to *meditation*, your mind is running around, with thoughts like: ""What should I do? Is this really all there is to it? What am I supposed to feel?""

**Meditation Technique #1** *Be Consistent* Choose one time of day that you can easily work into your schedule. The benefit of meditating at the same time each day is that your biorhythms will naturally adjust to it as a habit, like waking, eating, and falling asleep. Your nervous system will grow accustomed to meditating at a particular time allowing you to enter deep meditative states more easily.

Make sure your phone is turned off. If you have children, set aside a time when they're at school or asleep.

**Meditation Technique #2** *Create Your Space* Create a boundary between you and the outside world even if you're only meditating for ten minutes.

**Meditation Technique #3** *Where to Meditate?* Reserve a special place in your home to *meditate*. It can be as simple as setting aside a comfortable chair or pillow, or an entire room if you have space. Place a candle, flowers, or any special items that have spiritual meaning for you on a table as an altar.

Creating a place that is reserved for *meditation* helps because Spiritual Energies gather in the place where you meditate; making it easier each time you sit in the same spot. Like going to a temple, church, or place of worship, with regular practice, all you will need to do is sit in that place to feel settled, calm, and relaxed.

It can take many months of *meditation* to attain theta levels consistently during your meditation practice. Sacred Ground helps you to achieve those levels sooner so that you can begin to experience the life-changing benefits. Whether you're a new meditator or are experienced, let Sacred Ground take you to your inner world.

**Meditation Technique #4** *Create a Reverent Atmosphere* Invent your own soothing ritual before you *meditate*. Maybe it's at night after a bath, or at dawn before the rest of the world is awake. Light a candle, take a few deep breaths and dedicate your meditation to the unfoldment of your highest potential. Say a prayer, chant, or burn some incense if you wish. A tranquil and reverent atmosphere helps to induce a meditative state. Some people find **Meditation Music** helpful.

**Meditation Technique #5** *Position Yourself for Meditation* Sit with your spine straight. Use pillows behind your back for support if needed. It's important to have your spine straight so energy can travel freely up and down your spine. You may sit cross-legged or on a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor. You can also lie down, placing a pillow under your knees. If you tend to fall asleep when meditating, it's best to sit up so you can stay awake.

Tip: Theta is the frequency of *meditation*. Because theta is right on the edge of the delta, associated with sleep, it's common for beginning meditators to drift into a nap instead of *meditation*. If you fall asleep easily when meditating try using Brain Power. It harmonically layers theta waves with very high beta frequencies to keep you awake and alert.

**Meditation Technique #6** *How Long Should I Meditate?* How long you meditate each day depends on you. A good beginning is 10 to 15 minutes per day. You might find that you naturally expand your *meditation* time by adding five minutes here and there. Another way to expand the time you meditate is to set a goal of adding five minutes each week until you adopt a natural rhythm of twenty to thirty minutes. One of the pitfalls of beginning meditators is to be too ambitious. Trust your intuition and start off with an amount of time that feels comfortable for you.

Advanced meditators usually spend an hour per day in *meditation*. If you can gradually work up to forty or sixty minutes the better your progress will be. Consistency brings remarkable long-term benefits.

The key is to do it every day. The effects of meditation are cumulative. Richard Davidson, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin says, ""Modern neuroscience is showing that our minds are as plastic as our bodies. Meditation can help you train your mind in the same way exercise can train your body."" Therefore, each and every minute you meditate you're enhancing the biochemistry of your brain, building muscles that increase your mental, emotional and spiritual potential.

**Meditation Technique #6** *Sit, Breathe, and Relax* When you *meditate*, take long slow deep breaths. Send the breath deep into your abdomen and then breathe out. Each time you breathe in imagine cleansing energy infusing your body. When you breathe out, ask your body to let go of tension and stress.

Tip: To quiet a busy mind count each exhalation, starting with one going up until ten, then begin the cycle all over again. If you forget where you are, go back to one and begin again. Do this for ten minutes to slow down mental activity. In the beginning, many thoughts will come and go. When you notice you are thinking, bring your attention back to your breath. Linger on the peaceful space that lies between your thoughts. In time-space will expand.

**Meditation Technique #7** *Relax with a Body Scan* A body scan calms your nervous system, releases tension, and helps you feel embodied - sometimes we spend so much time in our heads that we forget we have a body. Practicing this exercise for five or ten minutes is a *meditation* in itself. It's also a wonderful way to settle down before you meditate.

To begin, direct your consciousness to explore your left foot. Feel the physical sensations inside and around your foot. Then move your consciousness up your left leg, to your knee, thigh, and into your left hip. Imagine traveling through the arteries, tissues, and bones. You might come across energy blocks or areas of numbness. You might feel tingling vibrations, as the cells come alive from your conscious attention. Observe the sensations. Experiment with how you can tell muscles to relax and let go simply by directing your will.

Do the same with the right foot and leg up into your right hip. Direct your awareness to the root chakra area - abdomen and buttocks. Next explore your stomach, heart, and chest, traveling up to your throat. Then move down to your left hand, feel the sensations in each of your fingers, and travel up your arm to your left shoulder. Repeat with the right side. Explore your neck and throat; notice how you can relax and expand your throat. Travel into your brain, let your face and jaw relax. Allow the muscles around your scalp, temples, and forehead to soften and relax.

Tip: EEG (electroencephalogram) research has revealed that when the forehead, temples, and scalp are relaxed, theta activity moves more easily into the frontal cortex. When those muscles relax you are able to go deeper into a meditative state.

**Meditation Technique #8** *How to Deal with the Mind* Gain the benefits of meditation even if you're a new meditator. Balance your Chakras, become positive and reduce anxiety; strengthen your immune system, and develop your creativity, just by listening to Deep Meditation.

The first goal of *meditation* is to notice and quite random thoughts. In his book, Learn to Meditate, David Fontana, Ph.D. says, ""By watching your thoughts and learning to identify them as distractions you have begun the path of meditation.""

As you practice *meditation* you'll become aware of how your mind runs around in circles with many different thoughts and memories. At first, your mind will be like a chatterbox, shifting from one concern to another, this is natural. You might catch yourself thinking about work or solving problems. You might worry about something that hasn't happened yet or remember things you forgot, like paying your credit card bill.

**Meditation Technique #9** *Label Your Thoughts* Observe the quality of your thoughts and then label them. ""These are busy, work thoughts,"" ""These thoughts are negative and limiting,"" or ""Here we go again with my To-Do list."" Then gently return your attention to your breath and expand into space between your thoughts.

Each time you identify the quality of your thoughts, you are making enormous strides in meditation that will inevitably unfold in your life. In time you will become a keen observer of your inner world. You'll notice when you've fallen into negative thinking and you'll learn to redirect your attention to thoughts that expand and enhance your sense of self.

The highest level of thought is positive. Positive thoughts soothe your nervous system and encourage states of wholeness and well-being. If negative emotions arise, such as anger, regret, fear, or sorrow, label them and then gently shift your attention to something positive.

**Meditation Technique #9** *Meditate Upon Your Divine Self* A powerful practice is to meditate upon your divine self, the self who holds vast potential and gifts. Use your imagination to discover the magnificent being within. Drink from the well of knowledge that will multiply your joy and fulfillment in life. Exploring and contacting your divine nature is what meditation is all about. Guided Meditations that will help you create nurturing states of being and contact your higher self: Guided Meditation, Retrieve Your Destiny, Fulfill Your Heart's Desire, Living Prayer.

**Meditation Technique #10** *Finish with Feeling* At the end of your meditation session, just sit for a moment, feeling the energies moving in your body. This pause before you leap back into the world allows you to integrate the meditation session into your daily life."

I usually get distracted with those because of noises or because of just getting lost in my thoughts. But with those I’ve never cried or felt like I was about to. 

I tried to do a quick 5 minute meditation in class (this was on my own) because I was pissed off and stressed from the class before. I was about 3 minutes into it and my eyes were getting watery. Somewhat luckily I got interrupted from my friend she was wanting to talk to me. Again I was meditating about an hour ago and I was meditating with Rose Quartz because I want to attract love in my life. The meditation mentioned something about “love trauma” and being hurt from others, I instantly started crying. I haven’t really had much “love trauma” mostly due to the fact that I go through a lot of failed talking stages. I can think of a few love traumas but it’s practically nothing. Any advice?"

&amp;#x200B;

Trinetra Kumbhaka is the breathing technique, as revealed by Paramashiva. This breathing technique helps us to receive the state, space, powers being and superconsciousness of Paramashiva. Trinetra Kumbhaka is the most powerful kumbhaka. Trinetra Kumbhaka awakens your kundalini shakti to the cosmic union with Paramashiva. This rebuilds your body, burns all the bad muscle memory, bio memory — it does everything best *(10 Apr 2021 — Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam)*

Kumbhaka Padhati, Verse 192

सकृच्-चन्द्रेण चापूर्य धार्य सूर्येण पूरयेत् | नियम्य पूरयेन्-नोभ्यां धारयित्वा यथाविधि ॥ त्रिनेत्र-कुम्भकः प्रोक्तस्-त्रि-नेत्रेण त्रि-सिद्धिदः ॥ १९२ ॥

One should inhale through the left and hold the breath, followed by inhalation by the right nostril and retain. Then again inhale the breath through the nostrils, and hold the breath systematically (before exhalation). This is Trinetra Kumbhaka by Śiva, which gives three-fold Siddhis.

# Technique

1. INHALE THROUGH THE LEFT NOSTRIL AS MUCH AS YOU CAN COMFORTABLY.

2. HOLD CLOSING BOTH NOSTRILS WITH THUMBS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN COMFORTABLY. DON’T KILL YOURSELF.

3. WITHOUT EXHALING, AGAIN TRY TO INHALE THROUGH RIGHT NOSTRIL AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

4. WHEN YOU TRY TO INHALE THROUGH RIGHT NOSTRIL, AUTOMATICALLY BODY WILL INHALE A LITTLE. DON’T BOTHER ABOUT IT BUT YOU DON’T CONSCIOUSLY EXHALE.

5. THEN, AGAIN, DONT EXHALE. TRY TO INHALE THROUGH BOTH THE NOSTRILS AND HOLD IT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN COMFORTABLY.

6. WHEN YOU FEEL YOU CAN’T HOLD ANYMORE SLOWLY EXHALE THROUGH THE LEFT NOSTRIL

Mr_Dr_Sauce,2021-04-16 02:55:25+00:00,How do people have such profound thoughts in meditation?,"It makes sense that paying close attention and scrutinizing all your perceptual experiences can lead to some observations you may not have made otherwise. What I’m asking is more along the lines of when someone is meditating and suddenly has some profound realization that clearly requires extensive consideration (ie. ego is an illusion). I’ve been meditating regularly 2 years now (Ik that’s still not much but it’s something) and when I start to think deeply on things like this, I “turn it off” as soon as it becomes intense enough that I realize I’m distracted. I feel like there’s no way I could just realize in an instant that there is no self and believe it without thoroughly thinking through it."

Is this what meditation is like for everyone? I've been doing it a while but am only now dabbling in unguided and it's rough.

But have you ever heard about the throat chakra?

This is one of seven major energy centers in your body that regulate different parts of your life. 

The throat chakra governs communication and creativity. It's also responsible for our ability to express ourselves and share what we have to offer with others.

The throat chakra is the fifth one of seven chakras in the body. The throat chakra, also known as Vishuddi, is related to creativity. 

It's located at the level of your thyroid gland and it has a strong relationship with self-expression.

How to open your throat chakra with meditation and [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idUyCcui5ng):

1. Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight and your spine erect like an arrow pointing towards the sky.

2. Visualize a glowing blue light around the throat area where the Vishudi is located. Notice how it makes you feel then let the feelings subside as you continue to focus on your throat area. Notice any thoughts that come to your mind. Let them pass. Let them go.

3. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Do this until you feel relaxed then let your breathing begin to happen naturally as you continue to pay attention to your Vishuddi.

4. Remind your self that you are confident and that you love to express the uniqueness of yourself to the external world around you.

5. Do this for at least five minutes everyday.

Positive affirmations are also a good way to activate your throat chakra. Here a few I came up with on my own.

1. I am confident and expressive.

2. My unique personality is a gift to the people around me.

3. I use my the power of assertion to stand up for the weak and needy.

4. I speak kindly to myself and to those that come in to contact with my being.

5. I love who I am and what I have the potential to become.

6. I express myself open and honestly.

7. I am protected, loved and honest with my higher self (or higher power).

I have started meditation. It is guided, but I think my question more lies with the premise of meditation.
After focusing on the breath for the duration, you let go of all focus. Upon doing this I start to sway and it feels like I'm shaking involuntarily, sometimes quite a lot. As soon as I start to focus on the weight of the body, it stops. It's not unpleasant, quite nice actually. Just wondered if it is just a me thing.

BTW It's truly changed my life and love this sub!:)

Today I went in to get an MRI Scan of my knee which I have done before. The MRI takes about 25 minutes. You lay there as still as possible while large moving magnets ""do their thing"" 

I've had about 5 MRIs in my life, most of them were brain scans. My point is that going into that tight and VERY loud tube is nothing new to me, but I had a profoundly different experience this time. 

From the time I arrived at the hospital I began to clear my mind, because my goal was to achieve a very deep conscious state whilst I was inside the tube. 

Within a few minutes of laying there those loud banging magnetic sounds began to fade away. Hopefully you know what I mean when I say my body became nothing more than a vessel, and I began to do nothing more than observe every little sensation. 

I felt something odd to say the least. It was like tingling and pulling not on my skin but more like my veins or nerves, or maybe straight down to the bone. 

After the scan I briefly asked the doctor why I seemed to feel something possibly the magnetic field? He laughed and said it's impossible to actually feel the magnetic waves from an MRI... maybe he's right but I feel like meditation has the power to open up senses that science doesn't quite understand. Or maybe I'm losing it haha

How do you meditate when there are really heavy work or personal life related thoughts are occupying your mind and dominating your attention? Meditating for 10mins or 20mins becomes very hard to do in real life in those situations.

Examples when it is really tough:

- Working on a very demanding job where even after you switch off from work... you are not really switched off as the work problems dominate your mind.

- Personal life matters. E.g. Events around the family or the loved ones that causes a lot of friction which is hard to get away from.

- Days when you frankly ""feel"" rough. Actually this is one thing where meditation has helped because I detach myself from my feelings and thoughts and realise ""this too shall pass"" and keep trying to do good things to return to a better state.

I am learning quite a lot so thought to ask you for any tips in this situations."

PoliticalNerdMa,2021-04-15 18:17:04+00:00,Feeling of euphoria normal? ADHD,"I’m really new to meditation from headspace. My school presumed its better to buy an app than try to change the schools behavior that was causing mental health problems.

I had one question, but here is some context:

I have adhd.
Now despite this being a disorder that has hindered most, I’ve been able to use that hyperactivity to hyper focus on learning my career topics which is really helpful.
However, the longer I’m in that mode, the more hyperactive my adhd symptoms crank up.

I need to constantly have stimulation if I’m in that cranked up mode. I need to be listening to some music, or reading something interesting. If it gets too high, it’s so bad I can’t get out of bed because I need a lot of stimulation to get out of bed and get off my phone.

Usually I had turned to prescription drugs, but those all stop working after a period of consumption.

Then I found meditation via the app.

A 10 minute session actually reduces that need for stimulation incredibly. And the effect lasts along time if I don’t keep doing it . Although, I’m trying to do it daily to build up my control over the adhd.

I’ve been doing it for 2 weeks now. In the middle of the session i experience something akin to ... idk a blast of euphoria . It actually feels very similar when I use to receive pain medication during my major operations. It produced a calming of my adhd and a bunch of “feel good” sensations.

Is that normal? To feel a sense of not just calm (works wonders for that as well), but... almost like a feel good chemical rush?

I couldn’t get this at the beginning . But the more I do it, the more I get that feel good rush, and the more addicting it becomes. So I keep doing it to feel that rush.

Anyone willing to tell me: is this Normal?What is this feeling? Will it eventually go away like the effects from medication that make me feel like this?

I’d love to learn more about this amazing process.

Because the more I know about a topic, the more interested in continuing in that topic I become. And I really want to keep this habit going . So if you do answer, you are helping me combat my adhd . 

Thank you"

I never get the feeling of waking up from being lost in thought, or unaware, is it because of progress or is it because of how forceful I was when I first started 2 years ago, I worry that I'm simply unaware of not being present and the mind just comes back to the present by itself.

Very rarely while going to sleep I've felt kind of like my mind has wondered off somewhere but theres no manually bringing it back it just comes back by itself.

I dont understand where to go from here, I understand the aggregates and non duality very well I believe that my lack of understanding of how the 'I' thought defiles every other phenomina arising as conciousness is the only thing that keeps me in bondage.

How do I study the self? Just sitting watching phenomina arise and pass away, I dont see how this will do the trick, because I feel that I need to understand how the self relates to the 'outside world' and I believe this combined with my knowledge of what non duality actually is could bring about the great awakening. 

I dont see how just watching can achieve this because theres so much phenomina happening every moment.

I feel I need to analyse what just happened instead of just being aware.

sowmi245,2021-04-15 15:21:34+00:00,Meditation: A Beginners Guide for Everyone," 

Meditation was originally used for spiritual growth, to become more open to and aware of the holy and the guiding presence of the holy. Today, though, meditation has become a valuable tool even for those people who do not consider themselves religious. It can be a source of peace and quiet in a world that is seriously lacking in both.

It can be used for healing, emotional cleansing and balancing, deepening concentration, unlocking creativity, and finding inner guidance.

When you begin your meditation, put your expectations aside, and don't stress out about the 'right way to do it. There are many ways to meditate and there is no fixed criterion for determining the right meditation. What works for you is the right method for you. And finding out what works may require some experimentation and adjustments. I list a number of different approaches below.

There are, however, a few things to avoid when you start meditating:

Don't try to force something to happen.

Don't over-analyze the meditation

Don't try to make your mind blank or chase thoughts away

Remember, there is no one ""right"" way to meditate. Just concentrate on the process and find the best way for YOU!

To start meditating, choose a time and a place where you won't be disturbed. That in itself may seem like an insurmountable task. Unless you are a hermit, there are probably people in your life demanding your time and attention. You may want to tell these people that you will help them find their socks, get the gum out of their hair, listen to their rants about the people at work, or whatever AFTER you've had a few minutes of peace and quiet. Let them know that this is something that you need to do for yourself but they will also benefit because you will be more relaxed, more energetic, and more loving.

When you are starting out, you only need 10 or 15 minutes for your meditation session. This is plenty of time when you are beginning and it may well be that this is all the time that you feel you can pry out of your busy schedule for yourself. That's fine - it's much better to spend a few minutes a day meditating than to put it off completely.

Over time, you may find your meditation time so beneficial that you want to increase the amount of time you spend in a meditative state. That's completely up to you. A good goal is to work up to two 20 minute meditation sessions each day. Research has shown that spending this amount of time meditating leads to better health and can help reduce the stresses and strains of daily life.

The process is helped if you can make it a habit to meditate at about the same time each day. Some people find that meditating first thing in the morning works for them. Other people meditate the last thing at night before going to sleep. There is no exact time that is best for everyone. Whatever works for you is good! Just make sure that you practice on a regular basis.

The actual place where you decide to meditate is again up to you. A few people set aside a room in their house as their meditation room but if you're just starting out, that's probably a bit too extreme. Instead, you may decide to meditate in your bedroom, the lounge, the kitchen, or even the garden - wherever you are least likely to be disturbed. It is, of course, better if you don't try to meditate in the living room while the rest of the family is watching TV. Other than that the exact place where you meditate doesn't matter - it's much more important than you actually start practicing meditation.

If you find that the original place you chose isn't working for you, don't be afraid to change it. The same goes for the time and the method that you chose. The ultimate benefit of meditation far exceeds the precise method of meditation that you use to reach the benefit.

One of the easiest ways to start meditating is to use a guided meditation. This is a CD or MP3 that contains all the instructions you need to achieve a state of meditation. All you need to do is to find somewhere that you won't be disturbed, sit or lie down and play the audio file. Soundstrue.com has many such guided imageries as well as meditation music.

There are many different types of meditation. We'll cover some of the more common types below but if none of these suit you, you'll find many more to explore on the internet. Feel free to experiment with some of the different types of meditation explored below until you find one that works well for you.

Centering

Centering is meditation in action. Within you is a space that is always calm and at peace. This space is often referred to as your ""calm center"". Being centered means remaining in your calm center amidst the busyness of everyday life. Being centered means not allowing your inner light to be overshadowed by stressful circumstances or negative thoughts and emotions.

When you are centered, you are in a state of clarity, focus, peace, and balance. When you are not centered, you are unclear, unfocused, stressed, and off-balance.

A good centering technique will require only minimal attention, allowing you to keep some of your attention on the activity at hand such as washing dishes, folding laundry, or gardening. Be aware, though, that your family may be more tempted to interrupt if they see you doing something. Just explain to them that you are also meditating and that unless they want to help you do dishes, fold laundry, or garden, they should leave you alone for a few minutes. Here are some quickie-centering techniques.

Simple Breath Awareness

While involved in whatever you are doing, bring some attention to your breathing for just a few moments... it needn't be your full attention... just enough to bring you back to your calm center. Breathe naturally, or perhaps just a little more slowly and deeply.

Reclaiming Your Energy

When you are feeling stressed and scattered, take several slow, deep breaths. With each in-breath, imagine you are pulling all of your scattered energy and attention back to your inner self... your calm center.

Letting Go

This centering technique combines breath awareness with the phrase or mantra, ""Let go."" It is especially helpful when you are tense and/or fixating on a stressful situation or a negative thought or emotion. As you inhale, say (silently or aloud), ""Let"". As you exhale, say ""go""... while letting go of all that is stressing you.

Relaxation Meditation

This remarkably easy and relaxing meditation makes use of a little-known secret about the eyes. Allowing the eyes to rest in a soft downward gaze has an instant, automatic relaxing effect.

Relaxation meditation provides a great deal of stress reduction and can be used as a quick 2 minute relax and refresh break almost anywhere (but not while driving). You will also realize a heightened sense of alertness.

Sit comfortably with your spine reasonably straight.

Allow your eyes to rest comfortably downward, gazing softly, but not focused on anything.

Without closing your eyes completely, let your eyelids drop to a level that feels most comfortable.

Continue gazing downward... the act of gazing is your primary focus (rather than the area at which you are gazing). You may notice your breathing becoming more rhythmic.

It's OK to let your attention drift a bit. If your eyes become very heavy, it's OK to let them close.

If you notice you've come out of your relaxed space, simply bring your attention back to your relaxed downward gaze.

Breathing Meditation

In this meditation, you will be focusing on your breath. This is probably one of the easiest methods of meditation, to begin with.

Start by adopting a comfortable position. When you sit to meditate, sit comfortably, with your spine reasonably straight. This allows the spiritual energy to flow freely up the spine, which is an important aspect of meditation. Leaning against a chair back, a wall, headboard, etc. is perfectly all right. If, for physical reasons, you can't sit up, lay flat on your back. Place your hands in any position that is comfortable.

Once you're comfortable, close your eyes.

Start to notice your breathing. We breathe so often that we tend to take breathing for granted. So take the time to notice your breathing.

Notice the air filling your lungs.

Then notice as you breathe out and the air leaves your lungs. Repeat the process of noticing your breath.

As you do this, you'll find thoughts coming up. They might be about family, friends, work, or absolutely anything else. That doesn't matter - it's all part of the process and it is perfectly normal to continue to have thoughts whilst you are meditating.

But once these thoughts come up, let them drift out with your next breath. Each time your thoughts drift, bring your mind back to focusing on your breathing.

Walking Meditation

If you find it difficult to sit still and keep your eyes closed whilst meditating, then walking meditation could be good for you.

There are four components to a walking meditation:

Becoming aware of your breathing

Noticing your surroundings

Being conscious and attentive to your body's movement

Taking some time to reflect on your meditation experience

Become aware of your breathing in much the same way as you would for the breathing meditation process. Notice each breath as you breathe in and then breathe out again.

Become conscious of the air filling your lungs and use each exhalation to send out any distracting thoughts.

When you start noticing your surroundings, you'll likely be amazed. We take lots of things for granted in our everyday life and much of what is around us goes completely unnoticed. When you are walking around, notice the different colors that you see.

Don't just notice colors. Listen for sounds. There may be bird songs, road noise, or the chatter of people or animals. Consciously tune in to these different sounds. Notice the different tunes sung by the birds.

If you are in an urban area, pay attention to the different traffic noises. Each car's engine sounds slightly different. So does the sound of wheels on the different street surfaces. You'll find yourself hearing things that have merely passed you by before.

There are also smells to fill your senses. Maybe the aroma of freshly mown grass or the sweet smell that occurs just after a shower of rain. There are plenty of smells in the atmosphere and the chances are that most of these have slipped past your consciousness.

Tune into your body's movement. Start to notice the light pressure on the soles of your feet as you walk. Be aware of the airbrushing of your skin, whether it's a calm day or a windy one. Pay attention to your body's movement as you walk around. Feel how your arms swing. Notice how you hold your head - is it upright and attentive or a different position? Switch your attention to different body parts as you are walking and you'll be fascinated at what you find.

Once you've completed your walking meditation, take a small amount of time to come back to your normal world. During this period, mentally run through your thoughts and feelings that you experienced during your meditation time. Think about what you can do to enhance your experience even further next time you choose to do a walking meditation.

Gradually come back from your peaceful site to your regular world.

Universal Mantra Meditation

This meditation comes from an ancient Indian text called the Malini Vijaya Tantra, which dates back about 5000 years. It is a very easy meditation, yet very powerful in its capacity to quiet your mind and connect you with your Essence or Inner Spirit.

This meditation uses a mantra as your object of focus. A mantra is a word or phrase that has the power to catalyze a shift into deeper, more peaceful states of awareness. The mantra most use for this meditation is Aum. Aum does not have a literal translation. Rather, it is the essential vibration of the universe. If you were to tune into the actual sound of the cosmos, the perpetual sound of Aum is what you would hear.

Although this mantra is sometimes chanted aloud, in this meditation, you will be repeating the mantra mentally... silently.

Before we get to the actual steps, there are a few important points to be aware of:

One of the keys to this meditation is repeating the mantra gently or faintly in your mind.

The power of this technique comes from letting go and allowing your attention to dive into the deeper realms of awareness.

Therefore, even though you will be focusing on the mantra, staying focused on the mantra is not the aim of this meditation.

Trying too hard to stay focused would keep your attention from descending into the deeper realms. Instead, you will be repeating the mantra with ""minimal effort"", and giving your mind the space to wander a bit.

Resist the temptation to make something happen, and allow the mantra to do the work.

This meditation easily produces a shift into deeper, more peaceful states of awareness. (The degree of this will vary from session to session.) It increases the flow of energy to the brain and clears away a good deal of physical and emotional toxins.

Because of this detoxification, it is best to keep this meditation to 10 or 15 minutes a day when first beginning. After a month or so, it can be increased to 20 minutes, but that should be the maximum for anyone who does not have quite a few years of meditation experience. Also, it is advisable to drink a lot of pure water.

Finally, mantra meditation accelerates spiritual growth as you achieve a state of relaxation and self-awareness.

Sit comfortably, with your eyes closed and your spine reasonably straight.

Begin repeating the mantra gently in your mind.

Repeat the mantra at whatever tempo feels most natural. There is no need to synchronize the mantra with your breathing, but if this occurs naturally, it's ok.

Allow the mantra to arise more faintly in your mind... repeating it with minimal effort.

Continue repeating the mantra faintly, and allow for whatever happens.

If at any time, you feel that you are slipping into a sleep-like or dream-like state, allow it to happen.

If and when you notice that your attention has drifted completely off the mantra, gently begin repeating it again, and continue with minimal effort.

After 10 or 15 minutes, stop repeating the mantra, and come out of your meditation slowly.

After any meditation technique, allow yourself a moment to savor the sense of floating and calm that surrounds you. Take a deep breath, gird your loins (figuratively), and venture forth into your daily rounds with renewed energy and a deep sense of peace."

chinagpsi,2021-04-15 12:56:50+00:00,Meditation and understanding one's nature,"Hi, this is probably going to be a long one. Skip to the end for the TL,DR. Also, I'm from switzerland and not a native english speaker. I hope my grammar won't distract you too much.

Since some time I am feeling deeply unsatisfied and detached from my job. Objectively it is a really good job: Reserch and developement, many different tasks, loads of freedom in my decisions and a very nice boss. I just can't feel and be engaged with it. It took me quite some time to understand this and fully acknoledge the fact that didn't want and didn't like to be an engineer.

Right after I got my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering I got my first job as an engineer. One year passed and I was feeling unsatisfied from that job. I decided to look for a different company and I quickly found the position I am in right now. At first I thought:""that's it! That is what you were looking for!"". one year passed and the novelty effect started declining, so I was feeling progressivly less involved in my tasks, working more and more superficially, and doing just the bare minimum of what I was asked to do.

I started noticeing that something was off, but I didn't listen to that feeling. Instead I focussed on my hobby (climbing) to compensate for the lack of fulfillment. This strategy worked fine. I was doing my job and wainting the whole day to get to climbing or do something else after the day of work.

When the lockdown came, the climbing gyms closed and the compensation wasn't working anymore. The unsatisfaction from my job became unbearable. So I decided to see a psychologist, to understand what was going on.

After a couple of sessions I was made aware of my inner working mechanism. The psychologist told me I should give more importance to what I want to do, and less to what the others want me to do.

Alright then. **What do I actually want to do?** Since some time I've been asking myself this question.

Right now I am thinking about switching to a life in agriculture. slower, simpler and more conscious life.

I've done some meditation in the past, mostly guided with an app, but never been very strict with it. I think I managed to meditate for 10 days in a row at some point, but then I abandoned since I wasn't seeing any effects. Now, with my newly aquired consciousness, I am willing to pick up meditation again with an open mind and an open heart and try to be consistent with my practice. I started a MCT (Mindfulness Compassion Training) hoping to get a deeper understanding of meditation and mindfulness.

Is mindfulness and meditation something that can help me?

Do you have any advice for my new jurney in meditation?

I would be very pleased to hear if anyone has ever experienced a similar professional change, and what they would advise me to do.

TL,DR:  For my whole life I have ignored my feelings and have always done what my parents/ society told me was the right thing to do. I am an unhappy and unsatisfied engineer (27 yo). I recently picked up meditation to understand what my real nature is and what I wanto to do in my life. Do you belive that meditation can help with that? Any advice to put me on the right track? Have you had similar experience?

Peace!"

When I meditate, it's usually 20 minutes per session twice a day.  I also know the whole practice of ""let your thoughts come and go freely"".  

I more or less want to know how people handle the certain sessions where it's nothing but angry feelings and thoughts.  I just had 10 minutes of it and I decided to stop.  However, I feel like I should continue until I calm myself down.

found myself standing mouth agape before a grand vestibule in which stood a single desk.  behind the desk was a man of gaunt framing, frowning at his Stenotype.

i asked him what this place is and he waved me off.  i slapped my wabajack on the table and again asked him what this place is.  he apologized for the confusion and assured me this is just the message post, but the real work happens down that hallway (gesturing behind him).

i asked him if i could have another wabajack and he told me those wabajacks were down in gear depot f7.  so i went to gear depot and got me one of them upgraded wabajack models with the buttons and stuff.

upon return to the grand vestibule i found the attendant to be slightly more hospitable.  he told me there was no need to slap my wabajack on his large metal table as it was quite old and i apologized, citing the fact i've become increasingly irritable lately over certain circumstances currently beyond my control.  he then pointed to the spot on the table where my wabajack had smacked and asked if i had any polish in my backpack, to which i responded that the only polish i carry usually is for shoes and it is indeed quite black.

he told me not to worry about it and that everything will work out as it should in the end as he directed me toward the exit.  on the way out i learned his name was Peter and that Peter was in fact quite Jewish.  

damned evil jews /s

oh, and on the way out he dropped this so i figured it was something important

I recently started planting.

Started planting happy little seeds.

&amp;#x200B;

A smile on the subway, a door held open, a 'Thank you'.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

It wasnt a heartfelt 'Thank you', neither an honest one.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont even think that it was realised as something other than noise.

&amp;#x200B;

Best case scenario: not annoying noise.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

But you know what it was? A happy little seed.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasnt happy planting it, but the thing itself was happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Happy that I tried.

&amp;#x200B;

And thats what it was. A genuine try.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started planting those. More and more, very little, here and there, but more and more.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

And you know what. It didnt take too long and I was looking back on fields of flowers.

&amp;#x200B;

And that felt good and I could let it go. Keep moving forward, planting happy little seeds.

&amp;#x200B;

And what came next started being less important, but I did keep an eye open for fertile ground.

&amp;#x200B;

Not for me so much, but for the happy little seeds.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

And looking back on flowers, even if its just one, that never gets old.

&amp;#x200B;

And before you know it you will realise that you have been your own happy little seed all along.

&amp;#x200B;

And you will see that you have been surrounded by fertile ground the whole time.

&amp;#x200B;

And then you will bloom as the beautiful flower that you have always been.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

I cant wait.

&amp;#x200B;

I love you.

3. When a thought comes up, don’t be so quick to return to your breathing awareness.
4. Instead, become aware that you are thinking (you can quietly say the word “thinking” in your mind) and stay with the thought/thought process for a bit, detach from it and observe it, free from judgement and opinion.

Sviat-Hni,2021-04-15 11:58:48+00:00,Meditation lesson from a former slave. How to make good decisions and don't waste your time on crap.,"Hi fellows! I'd like to share with you a meditation practice from a stoic philosopher Epictetus (who lived in Roman Empire) that helped me to become way more productive and make better decisions. I've framed it from his perspective, so he is a teacher here. Wish you a good read!

# -----

Hi, I am **Epictetus**. I was born a slave in the Roman Empire and was crippled later on in life. This was terrible fortune and not of my own doing.

But neither the shackles of my enslavement nor the limitations of my body made me feel limited. This might seem very strange to you, but let me explain.

Some things are within our complete control, while others are not. Within our control are judgment, desire, aversion, and whatever is of our own doing.

Not within our complete control are our body, our property, reputation, and whatever is not of our own doing.

That's because there are many external factors involved: illness, misinformation, and the impact of other people on us.

However, judgments and desires are internal to us, as we learned in the previous lessons.

But how should we deal with things like our health or our reputation? We can't really stop caring about them, but we can't guarantee that these things will turn out the way we want either.

We Stoics believe that we can't really fail in those things, as long as we are doing everything possible within our control. If they still go wrong, like due to you having an unexpected disease, it was not of your doing, so it's not a failure.

**Now, think of the last time you were afraid of failing, for example, public speech. How did you feel? How did it play out? Did you feel that you have complete control over the situation?**

We control far less than we might intially think, and we likely have mistaken ideas about what we control.

The problem is that by pursuing things that are not under control, we can't really control our happiness.

Let me give you an example.

It is like planning a sea voyage. What can you do? You can choose the captain, the sailors, the day, the right moment. Then a storm comes upon us. At this point, what are your concerns? Your part is done.

So choosing the captain was under your control, and weather conditions were not. So why would you even be bothered by the failure if it was not under your complete control?

What can you do in situations like that? Shift your goals from the external to the internal: repeat yourself that your objective is not to have a safe voyage but to do the best that is within your power to make it safe.

If you redirect your attention and desires in this fashion, you can't get disappointed that easily.

So let's do a quick exercise.

**Think of an important event you have soon. It might be a date or a public performance. What is under your control within this event? What is not?**

**Great. How can you focus more on things you control and pay less attention to something you can't?**

We should focus our energy and resources on affecting what we can control and turn away as much as possible from what we can't.

This boils down to the notion that we are in charge only and exclusively of our deliberate judgments, our endorsed opinions and values, and our decisions to act or not to act.

Nothing else.

I highly recommend doing this exercise daily, looking at specific events in your life. As you continue practicing, you'll internalize what is really under your complete control and what isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------

P.S. If you liked this exercise, I have written more lessons like that. Just in case you are curious to explore more: [**https://alter-ego.app/newsletter**](https://alter-ego.app/newsletter)

The themes I cover are: getting disciplined, reducing anxiety, learning about your life values, decision-making, the art of happiness, and being present in the moment.

The lessons are based on the primary sources of wisdom from more than 2500 years of history of philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Lao Tzu, Carl Jung, Stoics, and many others."
blackplotinus,2021-04-15 11:43:01+00:00,The Two Powers Of The Original Mantra And Its Perfected Breath,"The Original Mantra certainly isn't ""om"" like we boomers were told in the late-ish 1960's; and ""aum"", though much less wrong it fails us in much the same way. 

As such, had ""aum"" become the preponderant representation of the Sanskrit instead of ""om"", it too is every bit as likely to have engendered the same veritable oceans of understandable and **well-meaning embellishment, invention and personalization** .

The Original Mantra defines one particular phenomenon - the auditory cycle of a single, perfect, full and circular breath. It's the sound one deep exhale and its resultant inhale. It mimics that. 

It's what you hear in your head \[anyway\] when those two processes are taking place, it's easy to make the mantra the only thing you hear in your head and then to forget even the mantra until your alarm buzzes.

The Original Mantra is so perfect for meditation that it's ridiculously easy to explain. Ridiculously, astoundingly easy.

DancezWithMoose,2021-04-15 00:32:49+00:00,Three Things I've Learned in Two Years of Meditation,"Hi r/meditation. Long time lurker here, first time poster. As the title said, I’ve been meditating daily (~10 mins) for about 2 years now. Committing to a meditation practice has been one of the most positive life changing decisions I’ve ever made, and just wanted to share three of the most important insights I’ve learned in this time. 

1)	I am not my thoughts, and I think if you pay attention, you will realize that you are not your thoughts either.

If you’re like me, your default setting is to walk around completely absorbed in a continuous internal monologue. Most of us believe that this monologue is actually “us” in the first person sense. When you start to pay attention to your breath, and pay attention to thoughts as they arise, you quickly realize that your thoughts do just that: arise and pass away. They don’t have any more intrinsic meaning than any sight, sound, or smell that arises and passes away. Through meditation, I’ve finally paid attention to the fact that I am actually the space behind my thoughts, again in the first person sense. There is a deeper truth about the nature of consciousness to be discovered here that I won’t go into now, but suffice it to say this realization has allowed me to cut through many negative thoughts about myself and other people I have all the time. 


2)	Kindness, compassion, joy, and love are skills, not personality traits. 

I tend to be an introverted and melancholy person at baseline (again these are just thoughts I have about myself), and I have spent a lot of my adult life jealous of people like the Dalai Lama, Fred Rogers, and Bob Ross. People who walk around with a seemingly boundless capacity for optimism and joy, and who successfully dedicated their lives to spreading the joy they found in themselves. Through meditation (specifically metta, or lovingkindness meditation) I have learned that these are actually skills you can practice, not personality traits. Modern psychology tells us that happiness is both the 1) experience of positive emotions 2) sense of living a fulfilled life. Lovingkindness meditation has taught me the skills to improve my relationships with both the people closest to me and complete strangers, which has greatly improved my sense of a fulfilled life. I think we are taught by consumerist society that happiness is something to be obtained somewhere else, whereas through meditation I’ve learned that happiness is an intrinsic expression of undistracted consciousness. Which leads me to the third major lesson I’ve learned.


3)	The peace you feel during/after meditation can be felt ALL THE TIME. 

This has been a revelation for me. When I first began meditation I loved how calm and peaceful I felt during the practice and shortly after. Nearly two years later, however, I have come to know that this peace is actually the way our minds are when free of distraction, free from that continuous internal monologue. I believe this experience needs to be practiced to the point of stability, but all of us truly possess the capacity to live lives drastically free of unnecessary suffering. Ultimately, the point of meditation is not to become a good meditator. The point of meditation is to live a good life. 


If anyone is just starting on this journey, I implore you to continue your practice. Really the principles of mindfulness are based on a set of simple, testable, reproducible, and importantly experiential truths. Both the books Ten Percent Happier by Dan Harris, and Waking Up by Sam Harris, as well as their associated apps have been absolutely essential to helping me make this a sustainable part of my life routine.

I wanted to ask about meditation in the context of the grieving process. There is this tendency in my mind after this loss, I think, to seek distraction whenever possible. To sit in silence invites the heartbreak to pound around in my head more than I'd like, but I also recognize that this is also a part of it all.

If possible, I would like to hear how meditation has helped (or possibly hurt?) you when it came to great loss in your life. Are there specific methods which are more beneficial under these circumstances?"

I put some relaxing music to drown out the sounds of the household and tried focusing on my breathing first. Since physical senses affect me deeply, and I couldn't hear myself breath, I was unable to. However, i then switched my focus to the spot on the center of my forehead. I could feel it throbbing, spinning, like a galaxy. Even though my focus, at first, was still all over the place, I eventually started feeling lighter, as if my body slowly became more and more etheral in nature. I'm very proud of this, of being able to sit still and focus even if for just some minutes, since i suffer from anxiety, depressive thoughts and constant insecurity.

I would like some advice from the veterans in this sub on how to continue with the habit, what thoughts and ideas to cultivate so I don't quit, and if I actually am doing it right.

Tyratata,2021-04-14 18:49:04+00:00,"New to meditating, meditation brings me to my own personal hell","So I started meditating as I have suffered from uncontrollable anxiety for five years now and I also realized a lot of it comes from untreated adhd and also complex ptsd from my childhood. I also suffer from intrusive thoughts, since my anxiety ever since it got bad it has been manifesting itself through different themes all the time; health anxiety, emetophobia, fear of dying, fear of fainting, fear of psychosis, not being able to eat food because I thought I would choke everytime I swallow etc. Basically everytime I would naturally overcome an anxious thought, my mind would jump to new things to have anxiety over. Now, it is a fear of my own mind.

It's always derived from the same core issue, fear of losing control. Since my anxiety has been here for so long and seems to really want to be seen it just doesn't give up by trying to make my life as hellish as possible. So I get intrusive thoughts where I invision my own personal hell and I imagine shit from horror shows that has scared me. My anxiety and constant feeling of doom wants to be manifested through something always, and finds a ""host"" in a way. And the fear being of my own mind? It's horrible.

Often when I meditate (I use headspace, Andy's voice is the most reassuring thing ever) my mind takes me to those places. I try not to fight the urge to escape though, and I focus on the sensation of my breath while i let my mind think. Often it goes to my own personal hell, terrifying, sort of as if you would trip on psychedelics. 

Is this normal? Will this go away eventually? Any tips?"

At about 15 minutes it is quite strong, and it does not seem to disappear with more time.

I believe it has something to do with the position of my body, since I remember it appearing sometimes also when trying to sleep on a plane. I can not really meditate lying down, since I get sleepy quite easily. In my everyday life I never really have headaches, they only appears when meditating.

Doctors and Mystics alike have written and spoken about the benefits of Meditation and have given you many reasons to begin this Practice. In my small way, I have also tried to explain why in previous blogs.

I thought that I knew the answer.

But…

It is only right this moment as I drink my coffee that it hits me. The real reasons why I Meditate. The real reasons why you should Meditate.

As I drink my coffee, I find myself looking more and more forward to my morning Meditation. Actually excited. 

This surprises me. 

Yes, I have been meditating for over 30 years and love it but It came to me this minute that  I always saw it as a box to be checked in my day. One more thing done. A positive “thing”, a productive “thing” but just another “thing” that I do in my busy day. 

But my mind is blown as this minute:

I realize...

What a Luxury it is. What a Privilege it is. What a Gift it is. 

Time.

I realize that it is made even sweeter because it is a Luxury and a Gift that I give myself. A Privilege I grant myself.

I realize that it is the greatest act of self love and self care that there is. 

Time. 

A Time to Stop every day for just a little while, a Time to step off the Merry-Go-Round. A Time to learn about ourselves,  A Time to become intimately acquainted with ourselves, A Time to become and be our own best friend. 

A Time that belongs to Me.

How beautifully and gloriously Selfish."

I'm a bit bummed because I tried to get off my antidepressant but went into severe withdrawal and had to go back on (was tapering but turns out I needed to go slower). I've been meditating here and there for 2 years but decided I wanted to go harder. So I'm trying to do 2x 20 minutes a day during the week and 3x 20 minutes a day on the weekend. 

When I stopped by antidepressant I felt sheer terror. Now back on the meds I feel as though a heavy blanket has been thrown over it. I can still feel in my chest that it's raw. I've kind of always felt that way. I've been practicing loving kindness the last few days  trying to comfort that part.

What I want most if the achieve a higher baseline than just OK. I want to really enjoy life. I want to feel my feelings of sadness and joy.  I want to be able to reach the fearful part and comfort it. 

Can I really realistically receive the benefits of meditation while I'm sort of blanketed by the meds?"

Compassionate_Wisdom,2021-04-14 14:49:31+00:00,Meditation taught me how to find center all day - Here is my mental process:," · **Posture:** Spine straight and elongated as if string is holding up the body. Head tilted forward slightly looking out of the middle of the forehead. Tailbone tucked. Feet gripping the earth. Feel the energy radiating from your hands. See the full rainbow body in your mind’s eye and really feel it. Good posture allows the energy to flow better. Even when you cannot have a straight spine, at a minimum be fully aware of your body. Imagine you are breathing in and out of every pore of your body at once really helps, as it forces you to follow your breath. 

· **Relax the mind:** In the above posture, start to follow your breath as you breathe in and out slowly from your nose. Keep the focus on the breath as long as possible, coming back to it when thinking is not absolutely necessary (I am not convinced it is ever necessary, as the right answers just come to you in this state). Practice breathing deeply through the nose regularly. Be sure to keep the focus on the middle of the forehead. You will notice a tightening occur in this area. Allow it, you want it. 

o If you are unable to follow the breath without thoughts invading, **repeat this mantra:** Om Mani Padme Hum. 

o **Meaning:** To purify the body, mind, and speech through a combination of compassion and wisdom. Repeat this mantra using Sanskrit, it works better. 

· **Relax the body:** In the above posture, do a body scan and start relaxing everything from your hair to your toenails, checking every location. Get your body super loose. Stretch and do yoga in the morning. Stretch throughout the day as needed. Stretching will release stagnant energies from your body. 

· **Be Nice:** Think only in positive emotions and feelings. If this were the perfect scenario, how would you feel? Turn up the intensity (think “turning up the sexual intensity” but without the sexual, breathe deeply and get stoked to be alive – but remain centered and calm). All negative emotions are simply framing issues. Do positive things. High vibrational activities. The nicer the better. Always remain calm and centered, though. Excitement and anxiety are too sides of the same coin and will cause you to lose sight of your goal. 

· **Note**: Being “nice” means being nice to you too. You are the most important aspect of your Universe. You cannot help anyone if you cannot help yourself. So, make sure you put your personal growth, wellness, and happiness before all others. You are important to this Universe and worthy of many great things. But we all are important to the Universe. So, be nice to you while being nice to others. Win-win solutions are always possible. Losers are not a requirement in this Universe. Not considering your own or someone else’s feeling is a VERY LOW VIBRATION. 

· **Examples**:

o Motivate and inspire people to be their higher selves and achieve their dreams. 

o Tell the truth. Do not make up stories or exaggerate. 

o Help other beings. 

o Do not cause suffering under any circumstances. 

o If in an argument somehow, put yourself in their shoes. Deescalate. 

o Find win-win solutions.

o High vibrational foods only and basically just water. Lots of water. 

o Allow people to be who they need to be without judgement.

o Tell the Universe “I allow you to unfold for me.” 

o Listen to positive affirmations at 528hz. 

o If anxious &gt; tell yourself something positive and relax

o If scared &gt; reassure you are an eternal being and relax

o If addicted &gt; assure yourself of your divinity, you have been sober before and relax. 

o All feelings come and go with time. Transmute those negative energies. 

· **Intention/Focus:** What do you want? Its easy to lose focus if you do not know what you want. Figure out what you want. Admit you want it. Then take action to get those things. Write down what you want and tell yourself you have it with affirmations. Write it down, put it on your wall so you see it everyday. This will program it into your subconscious. 

o **What do you want?** Peace, love, and joy. Right? As long as you have those, you are happy. Stop worrying about what other people have.  

o **How do you get it?** Incorporate it into every aspect of your life. 

o **Repeat the mantra:** Om Mani Padme Hum

**I call this process**: Relax and Be Nice (or do high vibrational activities). You can use it in all situations. It works to improve every situation. Anytime you feel tense or uneasy &gt; relax and be nice. Feel free to DM if you want the full guide to this process, its free, but I wrote it for fun so please, use it as a resource, but always continue your spiritual education as this Universe is constantly changing, which means you need to always be present to see those changes."
Standard_Produce_410,2021-04-14 14:27:28+00:00,Awareness/energy below chest,"Hi ! 

I have been meditating for over a few months now and I think I am starting to get a glimpse and a feel for what the practice is about. I have been using the waking up app created by Sam harris, he does a great job in steering you in the right direction through his guided meditations. 

I know I shouldn’t be conceptualising too much but I am intrigued to know what I am experiencing currently and if it is a sign of progress. I am able place my awareness away from my thoughts to just below the centre of my chest bone and in doing so my inner monologue and thoughts are drastically reduced and I instantly feel centred, peaceful and present. If I notice I am lost in thought I simply ‘let go’ and place my awareness back in this place just below my breast bone.

Since I have been doing this I have been able to feel more and my senses are heightened. It almost feels like a home I carry with me, an inner peace that I can always place my awareness in and feel perfectly happy warm and fuzzy where ever I am. When my awareness is here it feels as though life is unfolding exactly as it should be and nothing needs to change. 

What is this? do I continue to place my awareness in this place in my walking life ? 

Thanks !"

That a vague depression is fine because its temporary but truly feeling and sitting within your emotions is bad.

Today, I listened to a sad song and sat by a stream. I admitted to myself that I missed my ex and that was okay to miss someone you will never see again. Like the stream, everything flows.

I have felt or made to feel less of a man for having emotions all my life. For the past few months, I have felt less of a meditator/Buddha, even if that wasn't directly taught , that's what I gleaned.

It's okay to feel anxious. 

It's okay to feel sad.

It's okay to miss someone.

It's okay. It is a part of you. Don't make meditation an excuse not to feel your emotions.

Sviat-Hni,2021-04-14 11:37:40+00:00,The only practical meditation you need to make better decisions. Lesson from a former slave.,"Hi fellows! I'd like to share with you a practical exercise in a form of meditation from a stoic philosopher Epictetus. It helped me to become way more productive and make better decisions. I've framed it from his perspective, so he is a teacher here. Wish you a good read!

# Dichotomy of Control Exercise

Hi, I am **Epictetus**. I was born a slave in the Roman Empire and was crippled later on in life. This was terrible fortune and not of my own doing.

But neither the shackles of my enslavement nor the limitations of my body made me feel limited. This might seem very strange to you, but let me explain.

Some things are within our complete control, while others are not. Within our control are judgment, desire, aversion, and whatever is of our own doing.

Not within our complete control are our body, our property, reputation, and whatever is not of our own doing.

That's because there are many external factors involved: illness, misinformation, and the impact of other people on us.

However, judgments and desires are internal to us, as we learned in the previous lessons.

But how should we deal with things like our health or our reputation? We can't really stop caring about them, but we can't guarantee that these things will turn out the way we want either.

We Stoics believe that we can't really fail in those things, as long as we are doing everything possible within our control. If they still go wrong, like due to you having an unexpected disease, it was not of your doing, so it's not a failure.

**Now, think of the last time you were afraid of failing, for example, public speech. How did you feel? How did it play out? Did you feel that you have complete control over the situation?**

We control far less than we might intially think, and we likely have mistaken ideas about what we control.

The problem is that by pursuing things that are not under control, we can't really control our happiness.

Let me give you an example.

It is like planning a sea voyage. What can you do? You can choose the captain, the sailors, the day, the right moment. Then a storm comes upon us. At this point, what are your concerns? Your part is done.

So choosing the captain was under your control, and weather conditions were not. So why would you even be bothered by the failure if it was not under your complete control?

What can you do in situations like that? Shift your goals from the external to the internal: repeat yourself that your objective is not to have a safe voyage but to do the best that is within your power to make it safe.

If you redirect your attention and desires in this fashion, you can't get disappointed that easily.

So let's do a quick exercise.

**Think of an important event you have soon. It might be a date or a public performance. What is under your control within this event? What is not?**

**Great. How can you focus more on things you control and pay less attention to something you can't?**

We should focus our energy and resources on affecting what we can control and turn away as much as possible from what we can't.

This boils down to the notion that we are in charge only and exclusively of our deliberate judgments, our endorsed opinions and values, and our decisions to act or not to act.

Nothing else.

I highly recommend doing this exercise daily, looking at specific events in your life. As you continue practicing, you'll internalize what is really under your complete control and what isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Old_Buffalo_3595,2021-04-14 07:56:49+00:00,The Truth About Sadhguru and Isha Yoga Center,"The truth about Sadhguru and Isha yoga center 
Sadhguru and his Yogis at isha yoga center are minuplative people, they shape an image of them being trustworthy people but the truth is otherwise. You may wonder why i say this but keep reading and know the truth from my experience. Sadhguru and his yogis enter my body every day and minuplated me in many ways making me feel like a human experimant. They disconnect parts of my brain and connect it in ways to make my mind work against me in unexplainable ways making me anxious for hours. They use this technique and drain parts of my brain making me brain dead and to make me not be able to write about the truth every day. Sadhguru and isha yoga center yogis and monks also minuplate my emotion first by making me happy for minutes but its just a trick, i remember sadhguru saying if you work hard on somebody they can make you believe anything they wish and then they start minuplating my mind with new connections pushing my mind wishing i was dead and attempt suicide then they try to help me and play their trick on me again. One may wonder why i have fallen for this trick but it is simple, the simple answer is they keep disconnecting my mind till it i can't generate another thought and make me forget everything they did so i started writing notes talking about how they minuplate my daily life to not fall for this trap once disconnecting my mind. Sadhguru and isha yoga center use this technique before i meet with people trying to embarrass me in front of others and at my work place making me incapable of living a normal life generating my thoughts with energy and pushing on my brain daily so i had to give up living and had to write this for the world to see. Sadhguru and isha yoga center play also with my physical body as if the mind was not enough, they control my facial expression and my energy in ways any sane person would be startled to hear my story. They kept disconnecting my brain as i wrote this passage so im sorry if by the end of the truth if i am unable to continue but i am trying my best to let the truth be heard. I am a regular person not a guru nor a yogi but once a seeker of truth and tried to protect myself by messaging other yogis and gurus for their help from Sadhguru and Isha yoga centers evil wishing their was an escape but if it doesnt work this message will be sent. Sadhguru and isha yoga center also have minuplated me in a way where they press on parts of my brain making me say what they want. I have learned so much about the mind these past few months they have been killing me as sadhguru once said the best way to kill someone is by keeping them half alive that i can explain and tell everyone everything what they have done to me"
lumut1993,2021-04-14 06:59:37+00:00,I feel gratitude when being present in my daily tasks,"For example, before going to bed I undress, close windows, unfold my bed sheets... I used to do it the fastest I could because I used it to achieve a result. The result was being warm inside my bed.

&amp;#x200B;

As Echkart Tolle say, feel every moment and enjoy it, so I gave it a try, and I have no thoughts and feel gratitude while doing it. 

For example, when I'm unfolding my bed and touching my sheets, I feel gratitude for having sheets and also for living in this house. That gives me hapiness.

Also for example, taking a break in my remote job. I used to go to the kitchen, drink water, perform some stretching and then come back fast to work again, but going to the kitchen, feeling free to take a break, to work remote or even thankful to have a good job gives me hapiness.

I know this post is not about sitting and meditating, but I think meditation can be done everyday in every forms.

Thank you."

I was in a convention and there was a meditation event going on so I went inside and sat down. I eventually laid down on the floor underneath the chair and relaxed. The sounds of the people talking in the room and the guy who was reading out the script for the meditation had completely silence from my mind and I was in a state of being conscious and unconscious. I could only see darkness and I could hear my own breathing and I stayed like that for quite a while. Whenever my friend woke me up out of the state, I looked around and everyone in the room had already left and we were the last people in the room. My body was ice cold as if I had been dead and I had a small/mini Hershey’s bar in my pocket which was melted before I went into the room and it was completely solid afterwards."
yvchawla,2021-04-14 04:29:10+00:00,Meditation is concentration of whole energy which is dissipated in seeking relief from compulsion of work or other irritations of daily life. It is the fusion of compulsion and relief that is the key to Fundamental Understanding.,"Living has become more and more a multi connected process. As you are using goods and services, almost everything produced by others. You have to work as compulsion to live, to procure goods and services you want or require. 

When you work as compulsion – you have to essentially seek relief through family, entertainments, religious-spiritual activities, ideas.

It is the fusion of compulsion and relief that is the key to Fundamental Understanding.

Whatever you may do in the name of spiritual practices or following any philosophies and so on, it all becomes a seeking relief device to cover up compulsion of work or other irritations, uncertainties you experience in daily life.

 One becomes so much attached to ‘relief’ offered by holidays, entertainment, religious and spiritual activities that one’s other days, other activities automatically become ‘compulsive’. This divide does not let one see ‘what is True’."

Years ago we used to be in school, our only worry for the following day to complete our homework. Once done, you can relax and play happily and enjoy the evening with you friends in the garden or park.

The garden has disappeared from my life, just because I wasn't letting my mind take a break.

Slowly, I am becoming more aware to be present in the moment, in the reality rather than be in my virtual thought world.
And I understand why meditation requires practice and patience, you need to build it up. Your thoughts can be more organized. 
Rather than worrying about things constantly, you can throw them in a time frame and tame them. Rest of the day, you relax.

I never intended to get any superpowers from it, this is more than super for me, for a stressful person who wasn't able to realize what was wrong with him. Hopefully it'll only get better hereon.

endotronic,2021-04-09 19:08:08+00:00,Beginner that could use some advice,"Hello! I am a beginner to meditation, and I could use some advice. I would like to warn you that this post may require some patience. If you aren't feeling patient, please just disregard this.

I suffer from anxiety, and my partner, friend, and therapists are very often recommending I start a meditation practice. Everyone I know who is into meditation loves it. So, with these things considered, of course I feel like I should have a meditation practice.

The problem is that I try guided meditation every once in a while, and every time, I absolutely loathe it. Trying to slow my mind doesn't just seem impossible, it feels contrary to my entire value system. Additionally, the narrator in any recorded guided meditation frustrates and annoys me after just a few minutes. I find the tone of their voice very off-putting in my struggle. The one thing that does work for me is to focus on a single sound or motion, such as the sound of a fan or my own breathing. However, I can only focus on this for about three seconds before I have lost focus, and getting myself back on focus usually feels wrong, as the train of thought I just embarked on feels much more satisfying and much more important. When I do experience some success, it is quickly replaced by an anxious feeling that I must be forgetting something important.

There are some ""meditative"" practices I have that I enjoy. I spend a long time every morning making the best espresso I can, and since I have only one per day, it is a highlight. I have read that some people find showers to be meditative as well, but mostly when I shower my mind is flooded with embarrassing memories and self-loathing.

If anyone has struggled to get into meditation in this way, I'd love some advice. Thanks in advance."

axolotl91,2021-04-09 18:52:03+00:00,Now is the only time there is,"Time as an illusion didn’t sink in until recently. I was lying down thinking about something and whoosh came in a thought. It was very clear. It was a thought with a time label attached to it. That is, the thought itself had no labels, but another mini-thought came in and labelled the thought as past.

In that moment, I understood what the meditative traditions have been saying about psychological time. It is not real. It only exists when you think about it. When I remember the past, it comes into being. I’m the one giving it any semblance of life. I cannot touch, feel, play and dance in past or future. It only exists when I label a thought as past or future. The thought itself has no time. It is the remembering that the event occurred in the past that reifies time.

When I look at my plant, past only comes in when I remember it was shorter a year ago. When I eat ice cream, time only comes in when I remember how it tasted before. When I see my nephew, time only comes in when I remember how much he’s grown since the last time I saw him.

Essah01,2021-04-09 14:45:39+00:00,do you guys think meditation can be stressful?,"First of all I am not new to meditation, just so you guys know that I have a basic understanding of it. I would do it from time to time and these days I am doing 2 or 3 sessions which are around 15 minutes long. I certainly enjoy meditating and it helps me to be present, as I am a daydreamer and have frequently spontaneous thoughts which are quite distracting.

As much as I like meditation it certainly feels like mental calisthenics.  I find myself distracted while meditating and bring my attention back to my breath. I accept those thoughts in my mind and I just watch the passing by like the clouds in the sky, so I dont suppress anything or lets rather say I try.  As I meditate this happens quite frequently, which is presumably normal I would guess, but I feel a bit stress or mentally exhausted one can say during the meditation after a while. Once I am done I feel pretty relaxed and calm most of the time.

so my questions are am I overdoing it? or is there even something as overdoing it if we talk about meditation?

What do you guys think about it? What is your guys understand of it and did any of you experience something similar?"

“Infinite Silence is absolute, before time, before space, before concept, before the universal beingness of I AM.

It is made manifest in Infinite Variety. Your form is like a facet of a diamond. You are the facet and the whole diamond at once! Infinite Silence is that which YOU truly are! Your divine essence. It is absolute and the animating principle of All that IS. IS = Infinite Silence”.

PuddleCreek,2021-04-09 09:28:41+00:00,"How do I - a person with acute anxiety and depression, stop turning away from the light?","Hi. I've been struggling with acute anxiety and depression for a year now. I had - and still have, but to a lesser degree - mental issues and was unintentionally harming myself. I tried my best to resolve life and health issues which I had and still have and became a neurotic and obsessed with order and discipline - I tried to control everything, as much,  as I could. I forced myself too much, I resisted too much. Underweight and with 147\\97 chronic blood pressure, I felt how life slowly leaves my body. I felt that I will give up soon, but neurotic part of me resisted. 

One important thing is that while I was obsessed with order and control, I didn't have bad intentions in mind. I was sure that my goal and my attempts are noble. I always kept others in mind. I just wanted everything to be alright. So I pushed myself to work hard to achieve this. And one day, 2 months ago, mother nature has taken care of me...

There's a story in the Bible about a man who was warned by God that his town is gonna burn down and God told him to follow him and not to turn back on burning town or he will turn into stone. ""Follow It and don't turn back or you are a stone..."" - popped up in my mind. I froze. I sat on the floor in the hallway unintentionally and saw everything unfolding in front of my eyes - thought by thought, action by action. I was pulled out of hell and brought back to life, step by step. Now I knew the meaning of almost every Buddhist, Taoist and Christian passage that I read. Now I knew what ""The Matrix"" and ""Mr. Nobody"" were about(I'm aware that I'm ignorant though).

I'm trying to follow it since then. But if someone asked me how to achieve this, how ""to enter"" here, what would I say? - Give up? Stop trying? Stop resisting? I can only loosely explain this and that's the problem - ""It"" is not always with me.

As I said, I'm suffering from acute anxiety and depression. I have panic attacks and then I'm going around seeking for the ways to feel better or to hide from it, not to let terrible thoughts to come in. Being in that state - of ""following it"" - to me is the only way to exist. I know that you will advice me to take my time, to be patient etc., - and that's a good advice, because just 2 months has passed. I know that mistakes are unavoidable and I'm learning bit by bit. But since I'm anxious, every mistake costs me 100 fold.

I want to describe it in more detail. I have samadhi every day and in that state everything is fine. Sometimes I can remain in samadhi for day, sometimes It's just a couple of hours. Now I'm in it and I use this opportunity to write this post in a calm and concentrated state of mind. I know how to get there intuitively, but I keep ""forgetting""(I hope you know what I mean by forgetting.) And when that happens - when I forget - I feel that hell slowly comes again at me. Every trivial thing seems like a monster to me - like an unbearable burden. It all accumulates and I'm overwhelmed by that. I'm in chaos. Then I wish I could escape, but I realize that I can't escape from that, because It's always inside of me - and this thought strucks me really hard. So I have samadhi throughout the day, I go to bed and in the morning it usually disappears(I know the relation between sleep and loss of samadhi). Then I just have to ""wait"" it to come back - some 2-3 hours, but those 3 hours are as I described. And there's always a chance that I lose it somewhere in the middle of the day(when I made a mistake) and It happens again.

I address experienced practitioners - how to prevent myself from forgetting or to ease those panic attacks at least? 

I'm seriously inclined to follow It to the end and this anxiety and health issues are just obstacles which I want to overcome. Help me do that, please. I can provide additional information about myself if needed. Thank you for reading."

It has long been known that meditation can lower blood pressure and helps with depression and anxiety. In addition, meditation clears the mind and releases resistance, which in turn allows your desires to start flowing more naturally to you. As a bonus, meditation creates a fertile state for imaginative ideas to flow from inside.

There are many types of meditation practices. A comprehensive description of the types of meditation would take a great deal of time. Instead, I will talk about some simple meditations that a busy person might use in this article. I will also present a simple mindfulness meditation that can be used.

Mtl2003,2021-04-09 03:32:37+00:00,Powerful Benefits of Meditation.,"Meditation is the art of silencing the mind. When the mind is silent, concentration is increased and we experience inner peace in the midst of worldly turmoil. This elusive inner peace is what attracts so many people to meditation and is a quality everyone can benefit from.
we provide five interesting facts about meditation.
01. Meditation makes you happier.
02. Meditation helps you manage anxiety, stress and depression
03. You needn’t be a religious person to meditate.
04. Meditation helps you fall asleep.
05. Meditation sharpens your memory.

Apart from enhancing your happiness and improving your overall well-being, meditation also helps your memory stay sharp and your concentration remain steady. With mindfulness meditation, you train in remaining aware of the present moment in a non-judgmental manner. Consequently, distractions are less and less likely to sweep you away. This is another reason why you should meditate."

It's more pleasurable than painful but not exactly that either. It definitely doesn't feel like an adrenaline rush either.

When I meditate I used to get this super clear headed feeling with this euphorical, peaceful, everything is alright type of buzz. Now after I meditate it just feels normal. Tbh I feel much happier but also withdrawn in a sense. It's not dissosaciation either. Like I'm aware what everything is and it feels the same but I just don't know how to explain it..... I've thought about posting this multiple times but I can find a way to describe it. It's like I can get to this state normally where I have no judgment but also no personality. I'm never stuck like this and I can function and act normal but it's just diffrent. It's also weirdly peaceful at the same time. 

Also I feel like my heads up my own ass more. What I mean is that when I talk to people I feel like I can be condescending. I don't know if I was always like this and now im just more aware of it or what. But I have noticed most people who get into spirituality tend to be the same way."

Why would I want to generate more thoughts and take my mind away from the present moment? It doesn’t make any sense to me and no matter how many times it’s been explained to me it never will

After performing this exercise, I feel amazing. Very clear minded &amp; peaceful.

A thought came to me after completing the exercise today. I was recalling the enticing mild closed eye visual patterns I was seeing midway through, &amp; thought of how, ordinarily, I would not be viewing this marvelous experience as I was during the exercise. I compared this to how, while crossing the eyes, one would not be able to correctly perceive with their vision; the sight would be imbalanced, &amp; so dysfunctional. Similarly, I think this might explain why I was able to see these hallucinogenic patterns of light &amp; color while balancing my breath &amp; subtle movements by harmonizing with these tones which represents the frequencial resonance of chakras within the body. Imagine that the bodies energies are misaligned, or else, ""cross-eyed"". So long as this is the case, inward perception will operate dysfunctionally until the energies are focused into more accurate alignment. 

Well, I hope I can encourage some of you to try this for yourselves, but I don't expect much. Take care."

The ""thought machine"" was particularly active that day and as I was tracking the breath and observing said thoughts, I noticed that they started to take a curious form. At my girlfriend's behest, she and I have been watching a lot of Grey's Anatomy lately, and I noticed that every cycle through the breath, my mind would form a random scene with Grey's Anatomy characters. There was no cohesion to it, simply a character would pop up and speak some incoherent line to another character. Then, I would focus on the in-breath, and by the time I was breathing out, my mind had formed a new scene with different characters. This went on for a while--there are plenty of characters to work with on the show. I think eventually it shifted to characters from House.

I couldn't help but chuckle internally, like ""This is the mind that I listen to all day? The one that plays dress-up with TV characters and speaks gibberish just to avoid the silence?"" Anyway maybe some of you might enjoy this little anecdote, especially if you've seen the show. Peace!"

Meditation is an excellent and profound technique which, of course, can benefit people who suffer from anxiety, high blood pressure, etc. One way to improve our health is to keep up our exercise routines and stay physically fit.

## How to Get Started

Now some of you have never taken a single step in your life that you were not positive about before, you know you have it figured out and always get the answers you need before asking your partner. And others of you are living proof that becoming the top spot on the pyramid is not an easy task, and that it takes determination and effort, it takes a tremendous amount of effort, stamina, and knowledge to get to the very top. And not only is the top spot at the top the only one that can grant you happiness but you know that each day, every single day, that you find that peaceful and relaxing spot you are an untouchable entity.

## Meditation Techniques

I find that not only is meditation wonderful for improving your life, it helps you strengthen your mind as well. Here are 3 ways meditation can improve your life: First of all, meditation can improve your sleep. There are a number of studies showing that those that meditate have lower amounts of deep sleep, which is crucial for maintaining the health of your brain. And your brain does a lot of things during deep sleep, from processing new information to clearing out toxins, and all of this is done with ease through meditation. The most beneficial meditation style is still the most basic, just sitting and watching your breath while you think about nothing in particular. Meditation has also been found to improve your memory.

Now it's all about you to decide how you want to use it for your life, and how can you put it to the best possible use."
lordofthstrings,2021-04-08 17:24:41+00:00,Voluntary vs involuntary thoughts: am I either?,"A lot of the spiritual teachers I like espouse the idea that we are not our thoughts and emotions in some way, shape, or form and I do believe that. I believe that we are the God Self, spirit, soul, consciousness, awareness, whatever you want to call it. The spiritual teacher Mooji sometimes calls it the ""isness"". However, there seem to be two types of thoughts, or at least there are for me. The involuntary ones that make up the river of thought that runs through my consciousness and the thoughts I'm thinking as I write this. Thoughts that seem as though they are directed and focused by this consciousness. So then my question is am I these focused thoughts? Are they part of that ""isness"" or merely a tool used to express conscious intent?"

Sokolowskierj,2021-04-08 14:08:35+00:00,A quick case for sticking with it,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to share my experience and recent breakthrough with meditation.

I have been meditating for about two years now, most consistently over the last year with the Waking Up app. I stuck mostly to 10 minute guided meditations prior to bed, 4-5x/week. While I feel like they helped me relax at times, I never really 'got it'. I would just continually get lost in thought, and every time the guided meditations had me focus on something related to 'finding' the self, or lack thereof, it never clicked. I thought this was all mediation had to offer me and I was OK with it.

This morning I had enough time (20 min) prior to work to meditate. On a whim I did a timer only vs a guided mediation, so it was both longer and open ended. The first 10 minutes was the usual - lost in thought, trying to ground myself with the breath. Then something amazing happened - without really trying - the boundary between my body and space had completely dissolved, 'I' was no longer a cohesive entity, but one with my surroundings, sounds, sensations, etc. I was in this state for about 5 minutes but it felt like an hour. 

When my timer went off, I felt like I had just come out of a strange trip, and I still have this nice 'glow' about myself. 

My takeaway from this experience is to stick with your practice, even if you don't think you're 'getting it'.

I'm posting this to request your help in moderating our community. Since I joined the team here two years ago, the subreddit has more than doubled in size. We now average approximately 2 million page views per month, with about 600 new subscribers every single day. I'm incredibly pleased that we are able to reach such a large audience, however, with growth comes growing pains. As any regular reader will know, spam and hostility remain large issues in our community. Despite our best efforts, myself and /u/theturbolemming sometimes feel like we're drinking from a fire hydrant. We need your help to prune our little tree of a community and help it to grow in the right direction. 

I've written a short questionnaire that I'll link below. It should take you about 20 minutes to fill out, but there is absolutely no rush to finish it quickly. As the subreddit implies, I would very much appreciate your thoughtful consideration and reflection rather than a hurried response. 

https://forms.gle/x6iLWd8o4PeAvzBx6

I'll leave the form open until the end of the month so that everyone who wants to apply will have the chance. Please be sure to include your reddit username and the time zone that you live / will be moderating in.

Thank you once again for making this a wonderful community, and for your help in keeping it that way. 

P.S. My apologies for anyone who doesn't like the Dogchen/Dzogchen joke. I think it's hilarious."

With that said on to the question. I find that I have fairly intense performance anxiety and part of the work I'm doing with my instructor is to improve my mental focus while I'm playing so that I am more objective and less emotional when an error occurs. My goal is to ensure time is not wasted on emotional response in the correction of the error. I'm curious if anyone has any meditative practices or tricks they have found that have helped them improve their focus and reduced their emotional investment when mistakes occur. Thank you all in advance for your help!"

When I put any pressure at all on it/him/her I get nowhere.....

But as soon as I stop EXPECTING it to do/be something or waiting/ watching - **BINGO!** 

I suddenly find myself being acquainted with my soul/God or whatever you want to call it.... 

So - my conclusion is this:

I cannot meditate with any goal in mind (which is counter-intuitive for a human).... but the soul seems to be reward me when I want **NOTHING FROM IT! : D** 

**So - I think this means don't meditate for a result, but meditate for love and the journey will take care of itself...**"

Creators are living and walking these planes within the enlightened sanctuaries of their hearts. 

There is no right and no wrong in a world where you are releasing vibrations of patterns that don’t serve the whole. The Light of God peaks over the horizon. Warmth floods into your being from beyond. 

The human mind can’t comprehend the invisible infinite. 

The heart soars to the voice of the Angel That you have come to know as your soul. The calling is so strong that lives change. 

The empowerment of Source comes when unsuspecting souls embrace the beauty of Love. The Heavenly pastures are not a dream, they are where you come from. The soul finds home with every loving heartbeat. 

Every flush of anger tears you away. 

In this infinite ocean the world is born. Don’t forsake your calling over the pettiness of other people’s minds. They don’t control you, they are animated by the same wounds that brought you here. 

Awaken. 

Wake up the God within. 

Source has no bounds. 

Feel the immensity of every Sun. 

You are the reason this world exists. 

It will flash out of existence. Arise. 

Ignite your heart to the infinite of everything that is.

Ok_Cellist_2410,2021-04-08 11:17:29+00:00,Space opening up in my 'head',"This is the best description I can give to describe how it feels when meditation is 'working' - both on and off the cushion.

When I am in judgement mode, or self conscious it is like my attention is narrower in a small 'ball' in my head - between the brows.

The opposite to this - when I sit, it is like a more open expanse in my brain.  Like the boundaries are breaking down.  And this goes for when I am off the cushion too; I feel less anxious, I identify less with negative feelings, and am more absorbed in what I am doing.

Just an interesting thought."

paralysisofchoice,2021-04-08 10:03:53+00:00,I had an anxiety attack while meditating and I’m too afraid to meditate again,"Title says it all. I’ve been meditating daily for about 3 months and had an anxiety attack a week ago. It was reminiscent of a feeling I experience pretty consistently - what’s known as ‘fast feeling’ or Tachysensia. There’s a subreddit where those who experience it gather r/fastfeeling

I experienced the regular ‘fast feeling’ as well as a dry and almost brittle feeling on the skin all over my body. I tried to ride it out and simply explore the feeling, but it was too much and my heart began racing so I had to stop. To end it I usually call my dog in to pat or have a drink. It’s the first ever time I’ve done it while meditating - I can usually do it by reading or during night terrors. I’m certain it isn’t an impingement on a nerve as I’ve experienced it while both sleeping and sitting. I think it’s purely psychological.

Does anyone have any tips on how to avoid it? I’ve been through a pretty bad depressive episode and meditation provided one of my only respites."
ihaphleas,2021-04-08 09:33:47+00:00,"How I used to ""meditate""","I used to meditate by listening to my breath, by counting my breath, by looking at a wall ... various ways ... letting thoughts and emotions come and then going back to my breath.

However, reading The Disowned Self, I realise that I have a lot of repressed emotion. I have used meditation, and other subconscious techniques to try to escape the pain of some of my emotions ... and even consciously tried to feel less emotion in general for a while.

What I have not done is sit and let myself feel, not just ""let the emotion/thought pass away,"" which was really me pushing the thought away, but to let it stay. To allow myself to actually feel it, to realize that there are no evil thoughts or emotions (though there may be evil acts), to fully accept my emotions and then allow myself to examine why and move past it.

Do some of you do the same? Is your ""letting the thought pass away"" actually repression of emotions you refuse to confront, perhaps something you consider ""evil"" within yourself?

Do some of you allow some of your meditation to be a listening and feeling and accepting and examination of your emotions?"

I'm just interested to hear from anyone elses perspective.

I have been meditating on and off for a couple of years now and it has very much helped me with letting things go and flow a lot easier. I had mental health issues in the past and meditation has come a long way to alleviate them.

Now, I am a manager at work who needs to be assertive and put their point across in a no BS way. I struggle to feel the anger to feed into assertiveness, especially if it's some I need to bring up with my team on a future date. This can make me appear too laid-back and passive. 

Does anyone have and insight on how to balance the zen of a meditative life and needing to hold onto feelings for the benefit of work or any other walk of life.

I don’t know if I even do it right but this time was different than others. After sometime into it I was able to observe my thoughts very clearly. Some of my thoughts are in words, most were in images that quickly go away after I spot them. I tried bringing my focus back to my breathing but my thoughts kept coming back so fast that I get lost in them, forgetting to focus on my breath.

One thing I that’s new is that I noticed something I can’t describe too well. Best I can say is that it’s either my intuition or something like it. There were no words or images to those thoughts, just a clear feeling.
I forgot what those thought were though(Bad memory/ADHD).

I haven’t felt any emotions while meditating.
Or maybe I did but I’m disconnected from them.

I could be saying/explaining this wrong. Or not know enough information to make my experience any clearer.

I’ve been meditating for about 8 months now. I had always done it lying down since I found I could relax a lot easier. I had never really fallen asleep in the process until recently, my work loads been getting heavier so I’ll pass out almost 10 mins in. Decided it was time to switch over to the legs-crossed-apple-sauce style but it’s killing me. My back and ankles gets sore, and I find I’m so focused on keeping a good posture that it gets in the way of actually “letting go”. 

*Anyone that knows me personally knows that my normal posture makes the hunchback of Notre dame look like a total amateur. Definitely saw switching as an opportunity to change that around.*

Naturally I’m frustrated that I can’t get anywhere near I could when I used to lie down, but I’m slowly getting better. I know the answer is practice, practice and more practice, but I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience when changing positions. 

Thank you in advance

It’s brought me calmness and all the expected benefits, but it wasn’t until today that I felt like I had a serious breakthrough. I was meditating and suddenly had an extremely vivid vision of me giving myself a hug. I hugged myself so hard and said “it’s going to be ok.

I wept during it because I just felt so loved and so comforted. This may sound crazy, but it was just so so so beautiful and I wanted to share it here. Keep going."

And also as I remembered everything happened in childhood got a very intimate/close/intense feeling with me that makes me connect deeply with them, so it may contribute to a better memory.

(And the old ""the questions are irrelevant"" deal.)","I know, I know, people say ""meditation teaches you the questions are irrelevant?"". I've searched old posts in this sub. This might be totally the wrong place to ask for that reason.

And I see that most nights when I go to sleep too. I go to the real world, and there I think ""Why am I so stressed out about that world that isn't even real? Why am I so desperately trying to see the light in that world, and get answers to my questions when it's not even a real world?"" 

Problem is, down here in this lowly not-real world, that doesn't mean anything. It doesn't help. I'm still trapped down here for 16 hours a day. I know the whole time this is not real (I really go my whole days with this knowledge), but that doesn't mean I can control it. That doesn't mean I know how to override the game. My world is a prison where money is the thuggish warden who rules my life. 

The old ""the questions are irrelevant"" doesn't help when my landlord's kicking us out, selling the house, I can't afford to rent my own place, and the only options that have presented themselves are  a joke to me. It doesn't help when I fear I'm going to be jobless soon due to a ridiculous working situation where something's gotta give?

This might be a not-real world, but when the man comes to cut off your electricity, you can't just say ""I know you're not real. Don't touch that box. I banish you from my existence!"". Or can you? (The people I live with twice thought they could not pay their share of the power, thinking I'd somehow sort it. I was worse off financially than them, and actually going slightly hungry at the time. The power got cut off a second time before they saw ""you really have to pay for power"".) 

SO, can we put aside the condescending ""I'm so spiritual"" talk to discuss things you've found that help when you need answers? Especially methods that don't require discipline.

For little things I find I can put it down, let go, confident the answer will come, and it does, because I have no serious attachment to it. If it's not money/food/shelter, it doesn't matter so much. For big things, they swirl round my head in anguish, and I just can't seem to let them go.

There's always one default, no-decision option that stands out among all paths for me, and that's the one I always take, short of answers. It doesn't give me an easy life."

But the past 2/3 weeks have been very consistent almost twice a day 5/6 days a week. 

Today I just finished a 15 minute session whilst feeling extremely tired. The way I practice meditation is by keeping god in mind and being grateful for his guidance. I usually chant ""Waheguru"" in my head repeatedly until the minds voice gets tired and can no longer say it.

So I got to a point where there was just emptiness (about 10 minutes in).. No noise just light awareness , a few moments of no thoughts just being present and basking in nothingness... As soon as i realised what I was experiencing a few seconds later my upper spine literally rolls forward a couple of centimetres and it felt as though I shifted into a completely different reality. Time literally felt distorted and it felt almost like 30 minutes. 

Can anyone explain what happened? It was so blissful and pure and felt so right like that moment was where I am meant to belong. Its almost like a high i want to chase again!"

nothinglasts43v3r,2021-04-07 21:51:10+00:00,Can meditation help heal trauma in ways that are similar to psilocybin?,"A few months ago I took 4 grams of mushrooms. This wasn’t my first time but it was a pretty nice experience. The come up had me thinking I was going crazy and it was filled with anxieties. Tre trip itself was an introspective one. During the comedown I felt super blissful as if all my worries were healed and melted away. I felt lighter and realized that stressing over the things that have already passed is pointless. 

Everyone has trauma. It doesn’t have to be heavy trauma such as being the victim of a robbery. It can also be someone being made fun of in front of their classmates. I believe it becomes trauma when we don’t allow those experiences of what happened to pass through. Instead, we constantly think about them and make the experience out to be more than what it was. We cling onto that idea, which then causes suffering. 

After my trip was over, I felt like my trauma was healed. I felt goofy and lovable idk how else to explain it really. I felt like a kid. 

Here’s the thing though. I’ve been wanting to get sober for awhile now. I meditate everyday but somehow I feel like I’ll never have another experience like the ones I’ve had on shrooms. Part of me wants to go sober but use shrooms as a therapeutic treatment only. But if I can get to that same place of healing by only meditating then I’m all in. Can any advanced meditators relate or offer advice?"
ShouldBeInMySpace,2021-04-07 21:48:49+00:00,My experience meditating for the past two years,"Hey all, here’s just a spontaneous write up on how meditation has made its way into my life, and how profound it is as a ‘thing’ to do. Some days I meditated for hours, other days mere minutes, but I have kept myself consistent in doing it.

I started in January 2019, and I can confidently say I completely embodied change as a ‘person’. The ebbs and fluctuations of my thoughts and feelings I constantly observed whilst meditating made me aware of these subtle changes I tended to ignore in every day life. Whether it be feelings or thoughts or perspectives, I began to really feel ‘myself’ as a malleable thing, not a concrete entity carried over from day to day. It changed my perspectives on everything. Food, drug use, personal opinions, dispositions, love, hate, academic work, materialism, literally everything. I found myself becoming way more honest in conversation and being with others. Before I found myself overthinking how to ‘be’, like I needed to rummage through a guide for my ‘self’ for certain situations. I now feel I can put in real effort in just ‘being’. In ceasing the effort to be ‘myself’, I seem to be more ‘myself’ than I ever have been in my life. I am not transcendent whatsoever, but time now feels like water flowing through a river which I try to swim with, not against. 

I turned from atheism to Buddhism and now simply have a much more profound respect for life. I feel myself less at odds with what is around me, and instead embraced by it. Even if what is around me is so different to me, as I would not be a certain way if other things were not a different way. I kicked awful habits, yet judged others less as I judged myself less. I can finally say I am ‘happy’, and I try my best to be aware of what I am attached to, and what sufferings I am lead towards.

I encourage everyone to meditate now because of how much it ‘changed’ me. Though, in retrospect, it feels like nothing changed in a way. It simply feels like I started existing instead of trying to exist. I truly believe this extremely simple action is what makes us all feel ‘better’, yet we will possibly all realize there is no better or worse, there is just all."

I know there’s many benefits and wisdom gained from meditation, but I have an interest maybe some of you have too. To be able to astral project/ OBE experience, any of you reached this stage? If so can you describe as best the “stages” from your experience before reaching this high level?
I know it’s normal to hear that high pitch sound (consciousness?) I hear it almost every day, but is it more common among conscious/spiritual people? 

This was the end, lastly i’m sharing a nightmare I had yesterday so read if interested. I’m a college student.

So I went to a new school, not sure if I failed or graduated the school before. However this school was different, there was a ranking system of abuse, teachers and top students could do whatever to others. Students weren’t allowed on the phone, only 15 minutes a day with supervision. When I wanted to go home, they made it very clear I couldn’t but I still tried. I got caught outside school, got beaten and brought back. So it was 9pm bedtime for all, still no phone allowed. I almost fell asleep but I noticed something happening. Two teachers were trying to enter my mind or something, her hand was on my front head and doing some movements I could feel it’s effects. They were surprised since it failed. The next day, everyone got work and if your not sufficient enough you’d get beaten. Eventually at the end of class, I saw a black cat (it looked like the one I have irl) I picked it up and walked outside. Weird how none noticed me, when I got out of the gates. Then they noticed me and I had to bolt. First a weird long human came after me and I managed to get rid of that one (not sure how). Second came a army of tactical teams, I felt the dream adrenaline. I felt hopeless and the only chance I had to escape was by taking them out. Using their own weapons and body’s as shields, they all got taken out. Lastly, a strange like horizontal portal appeared and clones of strange non-human evil clowns started popping out and started chanting some shit. Not sure what I did, but I finally escaped and woke up."

At one moment I felt effortless, my body reacted precisely to the curves, ups and downs, adjusting the center of gravity of my body and the angle of the bike, how much should I turn the bike, knowing how fast or when to break to keep up with my friends, all of this automatically. The cold wind hitting my face, I felt completely free.

For me, I can say that meditation helped me reach this flow state. Do meditation and flow states have any correlation?"

As you think, so shall you become. Like many of us, I thought that life should change from outside. I thought that I should bend the external situations and circumstances of my life to comply to my desires.

In reality, we have little to no control over outside circumstances. Once you understand this, it is liberating. We do have some form of control in the world within and that is huge.

When you change the world within, the world without will change. You might think it is a contradiction but it is not. Neville Goddard used to say that we are the Gods of our own realities. Through our imagination and awareness, we shape our world.

Might be useful for cessation programs to consider some breathing exercises / relaxation techniques rather than just focusing on replacing the nicotine/ tapering off less harmful forms of nicotine ingestion. Might provide some mental/physical benefits that prevent or reduce relapses in smokers."

That was an unfortunate translation of the Sanskrit. ""Aum"" would have been wrong as well, but less so in a significant way.

When used correctly the Original Mantra can be best thought of as a ""password to the meditation app inside us all"".  Used correctly, it's so perfect for meditation that the description of how it works is without doubt the **simplest description of a meditation practice ever**.

In the world of philosophy there's a tenet called Ockham's Razor, which states that the shortest, most direct solution to a philosophical, mathematical or a scientific problem is the best.

needvisuals,2021-04-07 11:23:24+00:00,Meditation as an emotional flush,"Been meditating daily for at least one year, might be 2 years by now. I used a timer and sat for 30 minutes, but very recently I stopped using a timer due to an excellent post I read on this sub. Without the timer, my focus has changed to soley feeling what is happening in my body. I spend much less time spinning around with my thoughts now, and I think that's because subconsciously I'm no longer trying to run out the clock. So interestingly enough my strategy now is to do an emotional flush on my body. I start with breathing into each chakra from root to crown. I breathe in breath and energy ""through my heart"" and exhale loving intention into the chakras. Interestingly enough it seems that each chakra has some kind of issue that will volunteer itself for me to feel and breathe through. This is a much more active meditation than before, I'm not simply focusing on the act of breathing. It's more like I'm trying to clear out the emotional clutter for the day. I was doing something similar to this before, but it's much more focused now. 

One question I would pose is this: I've heard that meditation should be simple focus on breathing in and out until the mind stops and peace is achieved - I've also heard the meditation is an opportunity to ground the energy of the body and power up the toroid field, whatever you want to call it. I do a combination of both, does anyone else do that?

I can see my goals of meditation - the intention to release tension when it arises and return to the breath when I lose track of it.  To let go.  To just be.

But this physical tension is my current default state.  I am more aware of it than ever, and it is gradually releasing.

But what is the tension?  What is the benefit of it?  Is that something that can be answered?

Or is it a continual journey of just noticing and releasing - both on and off the cushion?"

I live close to Atlanta, Georgia, which seems like a big enough city to find somebody, but I have no idea where to start. How does one begin finding a meditation teacher?  Just googling “Atlanta meditation teacher” does not feel like a reliable way to go for a number of reasons.  Any help is incredibly appreciated."

MrsKHall,2021-04-07 04:51:30+00:00,Used mindfulness that I learned while meditating to navigate a tough conversation.,"I had a tough conversation today that I had no way to prepare for and also had no advance notice it was coming. Instead of reacting with overworked emotions like I normally do, I used mindfulness that I learned during meditation to help me navigate it. Overall what I learned helped me get all of my feelings out without getting overly defensive. It's the first time meditation practice had a positive impact on everyday events."
Javyev,2021-04-07 03:47:14+00:00,Can you give yourself permission to forget?,"When I first started meditating I had this impression that it was about getting the mind to change in some way against its will. This isn't said explicitly in most meditation guides I've seen, but it is a kind of background ethos in meditation: you must surrender your will, you must let go, try to clear your mind, pay attention to this or that

But I think the real breakthrough for me was realizing meditation is a conscious choice you make. It's not a methodical practice that chips away at some barrier or a fundamental transformation of the way the mind works. When I sit down now, or even when I'm not but I want to put some meditative effort in, all I do is give myself permission to forget about protecting myself.

Stress comes from the desire to be safe. It's a tension that comes directly from vigilance. You are watching for problems and trying to protect yourself. When you make the conscious choice to *forget* about protecting anything, it feels very wrong, like you're being reckless and abandoning your responsibilities. This sense of wrongness is the only thing between your current state of mind and perfect bliss. It can even invade meditation itself, ""I have to meditate better/harder/faster/stronger in order to escape these horrible feelings I have!""

This means all of our stress is a choice we've made. We create it to remind ourselves to do this or that in order to stay safe. We are more afraid of being exposed to the world without protective walls than the horrible feelings our fears create. Removing those walls is not about force, it's about giving up on your perception of safety in exchange for perfect contentment. You can work out logically that you'll be perfectly safe forgetting all your problems for the next 30 minutes, but you'll never actually forget until you give yourself this permission. You can try as hard as you want to focus on your breathing or recite a mantra, but without this willingness to recklessly abandon your own protection, thoughts will continue to arise like the emergencies you think they are.

It's the feeling you get when you finish a horror movie and have to go down to the basement to get your frozen dinner. You know there's no one down there, but that doesn't change how you feel. You have to decide you know better than your own instincts. Once you're on the other side, you'll laugh at your own fear and wonder why you spent so much time holding on to it."

ikolpi2000,2021-04-07 02:19:35+00:00,Emptiness is an illusion,"When you can perceive something with your senses, you think it is empty. But in fact, it is always empty of a certain thing but full of others. A cup is empty of water but full of air. The black hole is empty of light but full of voidness. Nothing can be empty. 

But also, even when there is full water in the cup, the cup is also full of air (you just can't perceive it). Air can't come from anything. It is always there. It just needs the right condition. Just because it is in a cup, doesn't mean it is disconnected from everything else. Same thing with your sense of body. Similarly, you always say you are lack love, happiness, etc. But it is always there, you just can't perceive it. There is no need to seek it."

ikolpi2000,2021-04-07 01:55:29+00:00,Your mind and body is like a hotel,"In your mind, you have all kinds of visitors. You have a monk, Satan, a thief, a lawyer, a woman, a man, etc. You become whatever you think to identify yourself with. Something cannot come from nothing, it just needs the right conditions. And once you decided that you are a certain thing, you limited yourself to that role. You act out from that point of view. But your true self is the one who watches everything (in fact, there is no self). As a watcher (not really a watcher, just use it to explain logically), you become too emerge to the flow of thinking that you think it is you. For instance, when anger comes, it acts out a certain way, and you see it, you start to think you are the anger. 

As we grew up, we got more attached to the body, and we think it is our body. But it is just the makeup of the 6 elements: space, the knowing, earth( hard stuff like bones, tissues, etc), water, wind (oxygen), and fire (heat). Everything (living) is pretty much made of these things but in different amounts. The water in your body is not yours. It is no different than the water outside your body. And once it dies, you think you die. You become depressed. You might lose your memory, your knowledge, etc. But none of that is yours, you just borrow them (they are illusions anyway). Again, how can something come from nothing? We were never born and we will ever die. Most of us just start to play another role and got to emerged to it. 

Then you might ask, who you really are if you are not the body. You are the being. You have no identity. You change in every moment ( assuming time exists).  If you identify an object as a tree, in this moment, it might be make-up of these certain water elements, cells, etc. But a minute late, it is not make-up of those same particles. It creates an illusion that you think it is still the same tree. Everything changes. Your thoughts, feelings, identity are changing as well. 

Now, in terms of meditation, when anger comes, you don't resist it. Even if Satan comes, and you don't resist him, you identify yourself as someone who is good. But still, you got too emerged that you start to act from the view of a good person. You are limiting your power by doing this. If that good person got hurt, you think you got hurt, and become depressed. The right thing is to watch, without getting attached to it. Just like watching a movie, don't start to think that you the main character."

I have been doing meditation for around 72 days i have been using insight timer set on a 30min timer i cant seem to do guided courses as i cant see anything they say i should

when they say for example you are walking down a green field you feel the grass under ur feet,
i am like no i dont see or feel anything, so i gave up on guided meditaion after a month of trying.

I Decided to just do a 30min timer and see were my mind takes me but its not been easy, 

i count my breaths 1 to 10 to try help to have focus and i just let my mind wonder really and  try not to take notice of it just leave it to do as it wants.

i have found that i seem to be falling asleep at least i think i do, i am also sitting up not lying down. 

Within maybe 10 mins of starting I find my thoughts get messy and before i know it i seem to be out

i seem to come around 10 or 5 mins before the insight timer bell goes off and seem to be 100% alert as if i had a nap but have none of the drowsiness that comes from having a nap thats why i am confused i seem to be 100% alert instantly when i come out of it

Do i fall asleep or am i potentially reaching a deep meditation state which is my main goal      

 i am thinking of changing insight times to try something else, but if i am making progress here would it be wise to change it i am torn between sticking with this setup and changing to see if anything else happen as dont want to lse progress i have"

NoahBoombox,2021-04-06 22:42:02+00:00,31 consecutive days of meditation: here's what I've learnt.,"To start with, I'd like to clarify this post isn't to feed my ego or set expectations for anyone else; generally I'd like to establish some conversations, discuss tips, and thank the sub for its continued motivations.

So, meditation. I've tried in the past but never stuck to it. But since watching the Headspace show on Netflix, I figured I'll give guided another shot as it contextualises many techniques. Since then, I've been using the packs, Basics currently, to establish a routine and meditate every evening for 10 minutes.

Here's what I've learnt:

Some sessions concentration comes more naturally, other times it feels frustrating and distanced. I hope for this to improve over time.

I've picked up a voice in my head, one that narrates my mindset, or how I practise a session. It always is translating image or actions into mental subtitles.

I still ""think"" rather than ""notice. And this thinking comes hand in hand with my internal monologue.

When body scanning, my eyes physically reposition depending on where I'm scanning. My eyes are closed too.

Sometimes I fall asleep. I don't fight the sensation, I go with it. I like to think it's because my body is so relaxed that the learned reaction is to sleep.

Some days I'm more anxious than others. The anxiety of which comes from projections and predictions of the future, of which I occasionally pick up on and try to centre myself in the present. This is the key to levelling with my anxiety.

Thanks to everyone for reading, and to all the positive, personal stories I've read this past weeks. Any comments are appreciated, and I'll look forward to when my two month transition passes."
omargoldV,2021-04-06 22:40:20+00:00,Is there a specific type of meditation for reducing default mode network/intense anxiety/panic,"My biggest 'problem' in life is my nonstop rumination and self awareness. I generally just do objectless meditation since it is really the only thing I can do (cannot focus on one specific object), and a fair amount of the time my mind does quiet down. But it's also very difficult at times since it basically allows the network to go crazy and at certain points it's too intense, I just have to stop completely and go distract myself. And I don't sit down with the goal of calming my mind down or reducing activity (thus would make me panic if unable to), it's moreso that my mind is just too intense at times to meditate at all and I'm at a loss of what to do.  I'm looking for something either that is more active (if such a thing exists), or something that specifically works best to reduce default mode network activity (even if it does mean sitting with the whirlwind in my head).

I probably didn't explain perfectly so if you have questions please ask."

BOUMAIL,2021-04-06 21:22:09+00:00,Deep meditative state.,"March 12. I've marked down the date as I was writing effortlessly that note on my computer the whole time. It ended up being one the longest text I have ever written. 

A little context probably will help understand this experience a lot more. A month prior to this date, I had gone with a friend to Vancouver where we were staying with his friends. That night, we decide to all have mushrooms which a shit ton of it was stocked in one of the rooms in that apartment. It was sort of the first serious amount ingested by any of us. From there, I won't bother describing the trip as it's not the subject of this post. Personally, calling the experience highly intense would definitely be an understatement. As readers who have had mushrooms before will probably attest to this, a trip on shrooms has underlying effects, or should I precise more accurately, leads to a significant shift of perspective. The following days that prolonged into weeks up until the first week of March were very overwhelming. It peaked one day I was with friends of mine (of course by this time I had left Vancouver and went back home). This peak manifested in such a big emotional outburst ! 

This latter outburst I mentioned, to this day has left a big mark on me as I now undoubtedly consider it as the most important relief I felt in my life (I do not choose my words lightly). After this day, I quite literally have felt so much lighter. It happened on March 7. Five days later, I experience what will make the main subject of this post. The meditative state. 

Those days were swamped with profound emotions to say the least that sometimes would awaken spark moments of fear but then I would just absorb the overall benefit that I KNEW this whole period was and continues to be for me. This day, March 12, I am alone at home, I sit in my desk for hours I certainly do not even feel are passing. Probably was distracting myself with a multitude of Youtube videos mostly of discussions relaying experiences that people have gone through that I could relate to. I decide again that day for to write the rushing thoughts in mind for the God-knows which time that day. I started tirelessly transcribing all those thoughts, the initial one, just before the one that would criticize that first, just before the third that would crack up a joke, just before, just before just before ... I went on and on and couldn't stop nor did I want to. (I needed a little refresher her of what I was writing about so went on and got back to continue here) 

My ears were hissing constantly. I remember realizing that I was not peaking at my keyboard to type my words which I normally couldn't do as well as I was at that moment. I had the feeling that the typing was becoming out of my control and became robotic. All that I was writing about, were things that my mind was revealing to me and it just so happens that I was listening and transcribing it better that I have ever before. Isn't that what the definition of meditation comes down to: listening to your thoughts. I challenge here the common perspective over the state of our body when meditating (eyes shut, deeply relaxed and breathing) because I was experiencing at that moment a deep state of out of body experience having my eyes wide open ! No conditions on its definition right people ? By then, a sudden rush of wanting to pee at that moment hit. You would think that this is where a reattachment to my body would occur and yet it certainly did not happen. I was feeling very light. The bathroom is close to my room so I didn't have to travel for long to get there. I remember the feeling of the door knob when I turned it to get out of my room. I was very aware of the material I was touching (the doorknob) and felt it very vibrantly and yet subtly as if it wasn't me who was doing that. I was moving very slow the entire time. I get to the bathroom and stand up to pee and remember having noticed that I held myself exactly the same way every time I would pee and I was standing just like that at that moment of course. All of my movements felt mechanic and almost as if I wasn't the one deciding on them, my pulsions. Then comes the instant while washing my hands where I see myself in the mirror. I could see what my eyes were seeing in front of them. My vision was of course (and I had to look up how to say this just now) squinted. I wasn't aware of the word. Most of you who have had similar experiences like this before might be able to understand what I mean. We can consciously decide to jokingly squint our eyes. That's how I was seeing at that moment. I returned to my seat in my room and moments later i was gradually returning to self and remember my roommate coming in which sort of marked the end of that state i was in. And that's a wrap ! 

Stay well peeps :)"
skeleg0re,2021-04-06 21:14:10+00:00,Trouble with Posture and Focus,"Hi everyone!

I have been trying to do meditation more in a sitting up right position. I used to do it laying down and I often have problems with remaining focused. So I have two things that I want to address.

The first one being that I have neck and back problems mostly attributed to having very bad posture. This makes it difficult for me to sit normally without my whole neck and shoulders slouching forward. I try my best when meditating to sit up straight, but this causes me pain in my back and neck from the strain of sitting up straight and makes it harder to focus on meditating. Anyone have any suggestions that may help alleviate this or is there another way I should try sitting?

My second question is regarding my focus in a different way. I've been finding that it's a lot easier for me to clear my head and stay in the present moment if I keep my eyes open while meditating. But, I don't know if this technique is recommended or if I'm just stunting my own progress by doing this. I just find that it helps me stay in a grounded, present headspace if I am able to just sit in one spot with my eyes open just staring forward blankly. Any thoughts or suggestions here?"

So for the past six months, I have been studying and practicing mindfulness meditation and hypnosis, as well as dabbling in astral projection and prana breath work. It is a life saver. It feels like these practices are slowly re wiring my brain. I am triggered less. I get angry less. I am not as sad. My anxiety is not as severe (barely experience heart pulpitations anymore). Also, I have always had vivid dreams, but now they are on the verge of being lucid. My concentration has improved. Im getting back to me.

Even my breathing comes under control. Maybe on another post I'll talk about what I've actually felt.. but yea, the most important technique is SURRENDERING....

I guess that ALSO means if you cannot let go then techniques can only help you to a certain degree."

DandelionPG,2021-04-06 11:56:59+00:00,About Prerequisites To start a non-Ego type of meditation,"The development of consciousness is a complex and spontaneous process that takes place through the daily practice of some type of non-Ego meditation. Starting to practice this type of meditation requires a number of prerequisites, the most important of which are a highly developed level of consciousness achieved during all previous incarnations, especially at the mental level, positivity, empathy, intellectual curiosity, formal or informal education, lack of desire to control and manipulate people in relationship or during social contacts, detachment from material values, money and positions of power in society ... and the like.

Of course, these are, say, ideal prerequisites for engaging in some type of non-Ego meditation, but that doesn’t stop others from trying the effects of the non-Ego type of meditation as well.

The preparation process itself requires attending spiritual seminars during which the meditation instructor makes requests to the spiritual consciousness to heal all meditation participants, gives them instructions on the basics of self-healing technique with hands and chakras, strengthens the energy part of their nervous system ... and the like.

Only after that, to those who have shown success, is the text of the petition to be sent to their Soul communicated. If this goes well, then their Souls respond with a healing effect in the form of drops of golden rain that descend on their auras, penetrate them and begin the healing process. 

This begins the process of healing, later and the development of the meditator's consciousness."

blackplotinus,2021-04-06 11:12:50+00:00,"Philosophical Meditation, Henosis, and The Original And Best Mantra","The philosopher Plotinus is credited with founding what is arguably the most influential school of philosophy in history, Neoplatonism. He was well known for his ideas concerning ""awareness"", and more specifically - not ""unawareness"" but ""nonawareness"", which the philosophers referred to as ""henosis"".

If you google the word ""henosis"" you'll probably read that it means something like ""union with what is most fundamental in reality"". That sounds vaguely glorious and perhaps like some kind of enlightenment. 

However, when asked by his biographer how one might achieve henosis, Plotinus simply said, ""Take away everything"". 

According to his biographer, student and constant companion Porphyry, Plotinus only claimed to have achieved a state of henosis four times in his whole life. Plotinus wanted to go to India to study their philosophies and religions but major regime change in Persia meant that that as far as he made in his journey before he had to turn back.

Had he made it he may have discovered the Original Mantra and untangled how to use it. 

I've created a very brief, 3-Step untanglement exercise for my eight-year-old grandson.

If one starts resembling the app itself then you are not going on a path of meditation but being gamified in some way.

There's something disruptive and agitating about them, which makes me want to seek out a further sense of peace away from these sorts of sensory inputs. Perhaps my physiology has updated, perhaps they stress me out more now, perhaps I feel increased guilt on ""wasting"" time on these things, perhaps I'm just more aware or something that was already there, I'm not sure...

I do a sitting meditation in silence during which I try to focus on nothing and open up my mind. I already had great experiences, even one where I felt my mind lifting from my body (its difficult do describe ;) ).

Now I have two questiones:

1. Am I doing it wrong if my back is not completly straigt? I get better relaxation and better ""results"" if I dont focus too much on sitting perfectly upright...

2. I noticed while meditating that the left side of body is not as relaxed as the right side because I have a cramped muscle on the left side of my shoulder. That results in my whole left side being more tense. That sometimes during meditation makes me feel like my body is tilted to the right, sometimes by as much as +45° and that can be very irritating. Has anyone of you ever had that same sensation and how did you get rid of it?

Thanks for all answers already."

deineMuddaJunge,2021-04-05 23:11:26+00:00,What do you think about the Healthy Minds Program App,"Hi all,

I just discovered the Healthy Minds Program app. 

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.healthyminds&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.healthyminds&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=US)

It was mentioned in a german Podcast and I think it's just awesome.

I used for a long time Headspace and I liked for the beginning, but after a year or so I felt like that the things were repeating and I missed some deeper explaining content.

After that I used the Waking Up App. I like it is the more deeper covering of the subjects, but I have problems with the guided meditations. As a none native speaker it's not so easy for me to follow along with instructions. They are also too fast and little bit mumbled. I am also a little bit lost with the different tracks and I feel like should I try now the meta way or the stoic path? A little bit guidance would be nice.

&amp;#x200B;

Now with the Healthy Minds Program so fare, what I really like is the clear voices, but also the good combination of theory and meditations.

One is more guided and does not have to combine theory and meditation themself like in the Waking Up App.

Also the stuff is delivered in the right speed for me. What is stretched over 3 weeks in Headspace, like with the relationship meditations, is just handled in one sitting here.

What is also cool that you can do every meditation passive and active.

What do you guys think about the app?"

Glam-data62,2021-04-05 21:46:04+00:00,"Meditating to nikola Tesla frequency hz music, causing depression?","Hear me out, this really isn’t well put together but for a generalization before you decide not to read it all. I’ve been meditating to the 369 hz frequencies tones or whatever. And the next day I wake up feeling actually like mentally depressed like an unbalance in my brain. These could totally not be correlated at all but I also think maybe it could be and this is my frequency and vibration going out of wack before pulling itself together and I also think it could correlate to the stages of spiritual awakening but idk enough about it. I think like maybe it could be how those crystal girls experience Moldavite and it is doing something similar maybe? I hope I don’t sound crazy I don’t really know how this Reddit is usually I just joined it and I also just started to get into these things. I know it’s really long I wish I was better at making these posts. -Basically started listening and meditating to certain frequencies, got depressed stopped for a few days, did it again felt depressed. Before doing these things my purpose for them is that I really felt like I lost myself and was disconnected w myself and my emotions and the universe. I learned to handle my stress and emotions to the point where I barely felt stressed or many emotions. I wanted to regain those connections and feel stressed so I can care about things again and reconnect w the universe and myself.- ok im not gonna make this any longer, if you have any guidance, similar experiences, tips on next stages and management, or just think I’m crazy and trying to find correlations, lmk!

So i just started meditating to some YouTube videos that play sounds and music to certain frequencies that are suppose to have abilities to affect your frequency and vibration and what not. This was brought to my attention after becoming slightly fixated in Nikola Tesla (adhd procrastinating) and I learned about his 369 obsession and thing w frequencies relating to 369 or something. I’ve noticed there’s been a correlation of depression in me since I have started. I wanted to see if anyone has experienced the same or if there really is no correlation here and it’s other factors making me depressed. Also when I say depressed I really do mean like neurologically I feel actually depressed liek I just woke up one day in an intense depressive state my brain was just sad and my entire body and being was just sad and I couldn’t explain why. It felt like just a unbalance in my brain.

Ok I wrote how my experience of it this past week to see if someone has experienced something similar but I also have been researching Like “spiritual awakening stages” which I know sounds corny but it does also could possibly align w that stuff. But I feel like it wouldn’t happen in the course of a few days. I thought maybe someone could share their thoughts. 
I’ve only done it a hand full of times in the last week. I listen to particular frequencies after researching their each of their meanings. And the first time it was only for like 20 minutes max and it was just difficult for me to keep meditating w out getting distracted. And I tried again the next day and was able to for a little longer w some bumps in between then I tried to do more of it that night and fell asleep w the music on throughout the whole night like it was still playing when I woke up. I also did the 369 manifestation method as well (I figured I should go all in even if it doesn’t end up working) And the next day I was insanely insanely sad. It felt like one of the worst mornings ever. I have experienced episodes liek that a few times but honestly jsut around my period or on birth control or something so it’s not the most out of the ordinary thing for me to experience but it wasn’t that this time and I have really only had episodes liek that maybe 3 times throughout my whole life. This was on Friday and on Saturday I kinda gave it a break I was feeling a little bit better but it felt more like a sad hangover not that I was sad sad and on Sunday (yesterday) I wasn’t really sad anymore but i did sleep like all day. I gave it another try last night and I ended up meditating for over an hour and a half w very minimal interruptions and distractions. I also not to be corny I did have like a spiritual talk w myself and tried to connect in that way. I woke up today still a little sad afterwards. Not nearly as sad as Friday but considerably unnormally sad and to wear it again felt like my brain was unbalanced I really am jot sad about anything in particular and I have asset and ruled most outside factors out. 

I also am really not usually a sad person I have learned to manage and stabilize my stress and emotions very well. But I have been talking to this guy and I was telling him I learned to manage and stabilize my emotions so well that it is now a negative feature of me. Like I won’t even care or be disappointed if I fail at something. I have also been struggling w my adhd this year and have been trying to get a grip on it for so long. But I felt like not feeling those emotions was a factor keeping me back. And I was telling him how I wish I could feel them again and reconnect w those emotions. I just felt like I really lost sight of myself or really jsut lost myself entirely and I felt disconnected w my emotions and myself and the universe. I also use to have this kinda power w the universe and I KNOW ima sound crazy but the people in my life validated it and saw the crazy synchronicities that happened way too often. So anytime I would verbally complain or cry usually out of frustration about something the universe would INSTANTLY respond. This would resonate most or at least in the most validating way when I would lose things I would search everywhere and wouldn’t find them then as soon as I would complain or cry (yes I lost things to that point I have adhd leave me alone) they would appear in a spot I knew I had checked and within the same minute. This happened in other factors of my life too. But then I moved to college and just learned to handle my stress to the point where I wouldn’t react that way and now I don’t react at all, and I feel like I have lost touch with myself and the universe in that way and I have lost that synchronicity and I miss it. I started doing these things to try and reconnect w my emotions in that way and the universe and really just regain that connection and synchronicity. So that’s why I also think they could be connected and this is a blockage I have to go through before. -in my opinion, the universe did not have to do it that intensely, I personally would have picked a different method but to each their own."

ikolpi2000,2021-04-05 19:49:24+00:00,The logical mind is stupid and evil,"As we grow up, we reprogram ourselves with a bunch of useless concepts. When we are learning new materials, we tend to bring old concepts to judge and compare them to what we knew. This is why adults learn new things much slower than babies. 

We learned about history that certain groups were racist to others. But now, even when we have nothing to do with a person, we still hate them because of what we have learned. Same thing with the news, etc

Languages are meaningless but why would we give them so much power. When someone calls you stupid or threaten you, why would you react in a certain way? It is no more than a sound. We programmed ourselves too much that we are willing to kill/hurt others over language.

We should see things as they are. Once we speak or conclude (filtered through the logical mind), it is wrong. For instance, we call this flower sunflower, but in fact, it is much different from other sunflowers. We then formed an illusion of sunflower in our minds. But truly, there is no sunflower. It is what it is. Similarly, we name everything that we see differently. This is why we are limited. When someone talks about a sunflower, we formed an illusion in our mind because of past experiences.

A logical mind makes us greedy. We are so calculated that we would kill more animals for food than we needed. We would fight over lands even when the lands don't belong to anybody. 

We created an illusion of self. This is my body, and if you hurt it, I will kill you. But in fact, it is made up of animal meat, water, minerals, etc. Nothing is yours. The air (oxygen) inside you is no different than the air outside of you. Why do you think it is yours?

We so stress over the amount of time that we have with this body because we learned that we will die at some point and everything will be gone. We were taught to cry when someone we loved passes away and that they will be in heaven.  But what dies is our logical mind. We are more than just the logical mind. We were never born and we never die. What dies is this illusion of the body created by our logical mind. 

The logical mind is very limited. It can't escape the idea of duality. For it, things must be either good or bad or a certain way. But truly, things simply be ..."

ikolpi2000,2021-04-05 19:01:06+00:00,Flow state is the result of meditation,"Do you know that great scientists like Albert Einstein, Nikola Telsa, etc rediscover their great inventions in the flow state?

Flow state is when you let go of your ego-mind and logical mind. You just simply flow with your thoughts without judging them. It is the flow of the universe. In this state, you don't care about if you die or not, you don't care about if the world is going to disappear the next day. You are fearless at this moment. You are freed from your past and future. You are in the now. 

Example: 1) you have been thinking hard about how to solve a problem. But then you decided to take a shower ( you give up the trying), then the answer pop-up in your head. 

2) you trying so hard on your test to solve a complete problem, but then realized the answer after taking the test.

3) Athletics perform their best when they don't care much about losing and winning. 

4) many great ideas came up when you are calm

5) artists develop great songs when they are in nature (careless about the world)

The logical mind is dumb and limited. It can't function without space and time. It has to identify everything as good or bad. It comes up with a name for everything. It is a ""tool"" that trying to take over us. If you can't stop thinking logically, it took over you. Since it is a tool, we should be able to use it and turn it off when not needed. We do this by meditating, sleep, taking drugs, drinking coffee, take a cold shower, sex, etc 

How to get into a flow state?

Be faithful with what you are doing. Watch every motion, emotion, thought at its fullness (without try to resist). Give it your best.

Example: when washing dish, you watch how you moved your hand. You watch the sensation when water touch your skin. Do not direct your attention to a certain object. Be as a mirror. Reflects whatever comes up. 

You should not care about the results, the consequences, (free from the future). Don't care if you will die or not. Don't be calculated. 

You should not think about what happened a couple of minutes, hours, etc ago ( free from the past)

You should not think of other things ( not attached to the now)"

I’ve been meditating for 20-30 minutes daily for the past 3 weeks, and am starting to see some changes to every day life. I focused on being present during Easter church, and it was the most powerful mass I’ve been to. I’ve also been more relaxed when socializing, and am beginning to take in more from lectures.

On the flip side, meditation has made me painfully aware of social anxiety, slightly depressed, and resurfaced memories of things from my past that I regret. I’m concerned that continuing down this path could have a net negative impact... Are negative feelings from meditation normal? Is this something I should be worried about? And should I pause the practice?

Note: I’m a graduate student, working 14-16 hour days on weekdays so this is a stressful time - I initially started pursuing meditation to be more relaxed, go with the flow, and help with ego."

Back when I discovered Wim Hof and his breathing exercise, somehow I understood the method in a wrong way. Instead of emptying my lungs after 30-45 breathing in and out, I did the opposite and took a deep breath and held it as long as I could and it actually felt great.

I've been doing it like this for a long time and recently I realized that I was supposed to empty my lungs before holding my breath. Even though I've been doing wrong, I can hold my breath for almost 5-6 minutes and I feel like I'm achieving a state of mind that resembles calmness and something close to a psychedelic experience.

Do you think doing this distracts me from actually focusing on the meditation or did I find a method that actually works for me? Or, will holding my breath for a long time harm me in any way?"

StarRoadExits,2021-04-05 15:32:58+00:00,A Guide to Meditation," **Introduction**

Meditation  is the act of focusing our  attention in a specific way and holding it  as a mental exercise. This is  considered a mild alteration in  consciousness. Meditation has been used  in various forms throughout  history; sustaining focus on an intention  in mystical practices can be  considered a form of meditation, for  instance.

Meditation  has been the subject of significant  scientific investigation, which  has validated it as a psychological  construct and with tangible  applications and benefits. Engaging in a  regular meditation practice  can lead to measurable benefits, like a  reduction in anxiety, a  strengthening of one’s attention capacity,

**Single-point Meditation**

Single-point   meditation is one of the simplest forms of meditation. In single-point   meditation, you focus your attention on one single point to the   exclusion of all other thoughts and sensory perceptions. The subject you   choose can be whatever you want. It’s easy to pick out something that   catches your eye in your immediate environment and focus on that. You   could focus on a yellow floor tile that catches your eye, or feel the   texture of the blanket on your couch. You could focus on something you   visualized inside of your head.

Many  people enjoy focusing on a  repetitive physical sensation like  breathing. They feel air flow into  their lungs, and then feel the air  leave as they exhale. Anytime they  feel a distracting thought, they  focus their attention on their  breathing and let go of their thoughts.  Some people close their eyes and  imagine their breath as colored whisps  of smoke, glowing blue as they  inhale and then red as they exhale,  flowing in and out.

Pick a   comfortable position; some people like sitting or laying down, others   like to stand. Set aside twenty minutes of time where you won’t be   disturbed, and plan to repeat this exercise several times a week. The   key to experiencing the full range of benefits from meditation is to   practice regularly; multiple times a week is preferred.

Begin   by focusing on your chosen subject. Focus on your subject and allow   your thoughts to slip away. Allow your worries and present concerns to   slip away, turning your thoughts back to your chosen subject each time   something distracts you. It is okay to lose your focus and be   distracted; this will happen many times, and it never really goes away.   Anchor your entire existence around perceiving your subject; if your   subject is breathing, allow your focus on that action to fill your   entire perception of reality. Eventually, you should enter a calm state   of mind where you are completely centered in the present, focused on   your chosen subject.

**Mindfulness**

In  mindfulness meditation, we focus on  thought itself. Whenever a thought  arises, we disengage from it and  return to focusing on our thoughts.  In many respects, we are focused on  the act of disengagement from  thought.

Engaging in  mindfulness  is incredibly simple. Pick a comfortable position and set  aside twenty  minutes of time where you won’t be disturbed. Consider  using a timer so  that you aren’t preoccupied with keeping track of the  time.

Focus.  You do not need to close your eyes. Rather,  allow yourself to focus  without a subject. What is demanding your  attention? Sensory details,  thoughts. Accept and disengage from each  thought and environmental  circumstance. Accept all thoughts and feelings  without judgment, and  let go of them without further engagement. Over  time, your thoughts  will begin to quiet, leaving you with a temporarily  quiet mind free  from anxiety that is completely anchored in the present.

Practicing   mindfulness can lead to the development of a mindful mindset. In other   words, the state of mindful acceptance provoked by mindfulness   meditation becomes chronic. This helps aid an individual in managing   mental health symptoms. People become used to letting go of thoughts and   feelings, even difficult ones. The practice of nonjudgmental  acceptance  allows people to accept their thoughts more easily.

**Mantra Meditation**

Mantra  meditations are very popular.  Transcendental meditation is a form of  mantra meditation. Many different  types of mantras except, conceptually  speaking. A mantra is a  repetitive phrase, action, or idea that we  focus on to the exclusion of  all other thought. Because of the  repetitive and cognitively exhausting  nature of the mantra, it  overwhelms our psychological defenses in a  distinct way.

Choosing  a mantra is simple. It can be anything  from a word that means  something to you to a nonsense string of letters  and numbers. Pick your  mantra, and begin meditating. Focus on the  action of repeating your  mantra under your breath to yourself. If  necessary, you can repeat it  in your mind (as opposed to out loud) for a  similar effect. Focus on  repeating your mantra for the duration of your  meditation session. The  repetition of your mantra should be the sole  focus of your meditation  session, all other thoughts should be ignored  and drowned out with your  mantra. Your mantra will very quickly drown  out your thoughts, leaving  you with a calm mind.

**Open Monitoring**

Open  monitoring is a very useful form of  meditation. In open monitoring, we  watch our thoughts without judgment.  We let our thoughts play out  without intervention. Clearing our mind is  not the goal of this form of  meditation.

Begin meditating.   Look at your thoughts, your imagination, your mind’s eye. Immerse   yourself in this mental place, focusing solely on your thoughts. Do not   engage with or judge your thoughts. Allow them to exist without   interacting with them. Be an observer to your own thought processes. If   you find yourself judging, engaging with, or otherwise interacting with   your thoughts - step back and let go, then re-focus your attention on   your thoughts.

Open monitoring is  very useful for detecting  the origin of trains of thought. If you  watch your thoughts when  something triggers an anxiety or PTSD  response, you can see the train of  associations back to the original  memory (or something related to the  original memory) there. You can see  more mundane connections between  everyday ideas when you monitor your  thoughts. The way the mind is  associatively connected is revealed to  the person who learns to  chronically watch their thoughts."

The gist of it being we all experience pain, be it physical or mental or spiritual, which was referred to as the first arrow, and illustrated as experiencing being pierced by an arrow. Ouch, right? The conversation then went on to explain that suffering is the second arrow, and while we can’t control the first arrow, we can choose to suffer or not suffer. 

I am curious to know how you work through or deal with your own suffering? Furthermore, how does this show up in your meditation? Are there any mantras or affirmations that are helpful for learning how to accept mental/spiritual/emotional pain but not suffer because of it?"

No thoughts, no worries, anticipations, etc. a good analogy is if you think of your thoughts like clouds. On a normal day, it’s sunny outside and you’ll see clouds of different shapes / sizes passing along all throughout the day. Some days it’s a hurricane, some days there are a lot of clouds.

panda42042,2021-04-05 11:58:46+00:00,Cutting out sound with meditation,"Short question: 
          I have heard that there is a way to cut out sound and noises without using headphones, but rather by meditating. How is this achieved?

Long question:
          My mother is a former primary school teacher and a very religious person at that. She taught English in Japan in the early 90s and had to go through studying methods to calm students down by making them meditate. As a Christian, she does not have a high opinion of meditation and believes that it is a form of evil, however, one time she decided to try out a meditation tactic that was assigned to her. The meditation was supposed to eliminate sound from her surroundings by focusing on them intently (that's all the details I have). She tried this out in a crowded and noisy environment on a Japanese train on the way to work, and to her amazement, it worked. She eliminated all sound from her surroundings and was left in complete peace. At this moment, she heard a deep male voice saying ""it's quiet here isn't it?"" This both shocked her and creeped her out at the same time, and she decided never to do it again due to its close connection to the devil.

This is the story that she told me, she wasn't the type of person to lie to her children so I'm guessing she actually heard the voice. It's been year's since she told me this, and she refused to tell me anything more about it (she thought she sensed that I was interested or something I guess).

Has anyone heard of this meditation style? Does anyone know the steps you take to get to this state?"

I started meditating about 4 months ago, and have been using the app ""waking up"" by Sam Harris.
The first 2 months was great and helped me be alot more mindful through my days. But the last 2 months ive encountered a problem.

It started out as a fear that maybe im not meditating the right way, i started overthinking the practice and became a little obsessive about it. Now i find myself constantly thinking about my experience and analyzing everything during practice, sometimes during the rest of my day also. This has made me alot more distracted and somewhat cut off from the people around me, because i find myself lost i thought  most of the day.
Im much more distracted now than i was when i started, kinda the opposite of being mindful.

Im thinking alot about how things ""should"" be during meditation. For example: When i notice that a thought is present i try to let it be and watch it until it passes, when it does, i think ""it passed"" and i watch that thought and it goes on looping. I get lost in thought after every new sensation i notice also. I have tried to ignore it, tried to accept it, observe it. But it just goes on. 
Im gonna give it a last try this week but if nothing works i feel i need tp end my practice. Its not worth it, being so lost in thought all the time has made me somewhat depressed, cut off from the people around me, and flat emotionally.

So if anyone got some tips for me i would really appreciate it, maybe someone have experienced something similar?"

Two weeks ago, my dreams started shifting and becoming more lucid, and I dreamt about a wolf. Last night I went into my garden, candle in water, sage burning. I sat on the ground and tried to summon the wolf to speak to it. As the wolf and I reached a clearing and I pet it, a strong gust of wind blew the candle out, I felt electricity surge through the base of my spine and burst through the top of my head. My whole body was pulsing and burning and I was overcome with emotion and memories. The wolf was telling me, ""We were always alone, remember? Remember. Remember."" I sobbed and ugly-cried for a good minute.

When I told my friend this, she said that might have been a kundalini awakening. I'm not well-versed in kundalini at all.

beamoflight42,2021-04-05 08:44:32+00:00,I finally understand why it's important not to stop practicing,"So it finally happened, after a bit over a year and a half(?) of meditating daily. Though I would argue the time it takes isn't important. 

In the midst of a semi-panic attack, it finally clicked. 

This time instead of resisting, I simply accepted the fact, like I had many other panic attacks, that I was going to (what felt like) die. But this time instead of worrying I started only focusing on each breath, deep conscious breaths. 

I put on a (what felt like) random Metta meditation by Sam Harris, can't hurt to practice some love if this is my final moments was probably along what I was thinking. 

But this time something completely different happened, instead of the panic attack gradually disappearing, something just snapped and I got this overwhelming sense of love, understanding and that everything was okay. 

I can't really explain it, and it probably does sound quite strange but I know that many others have probably gone through what I did (as I've definitely seen on previous posts here) and I just wanted to share this happiness. 

If anybody can give some simple advice on how to proceed forward apart from just continuing meditating that would be highly appreciated. Maybe some advice on interesting topics to look into related to mindfulness (buddhism, hinduism etc, anything really I love learning about everything and anything)

Right now I'm just focusing on taking each day and moment as it happens, there's of course still a lot of unsolved challenges in my life but the main thing that's changed now I would say is I never lose hope in the same way I did before, and so far I don't feel bad (sad, anxious, worried) in the same way as before, and just trying slowly to meditate a little more over time than I have been (initially when I started it was 10 min, then 20 min each day but then I lost priority a little and it went back to 10 minutes), though I think what is important isn't how long you formally practice but that you really do try to practice being mindful in each moment of daily life too (which is really difficult but I'm quickly seeing progress)"

I'm a complete novice to meditation but I've been familiar with it my whole life, my mom used to take me to her meditation seminars and they usually had like a parallel kids seminar, where they would teach us a few things, but I was never too interested until now that I'm an adult.

I've always felt a tingly sensation in between my  eyebrows, a lil up towards my forehead, whenever I pray, concentrate on something or try to meditate, it has always happened to me as far as I remember, so I was wondering if someone could tell me what it means. The only thing similar that I found online is the third eye but like I said before, I'm not training meditation, so I think that's such an advanced concept should not apply to me.

I also have a lot of trouble emptying my mind so any tips would also be appreciated."

Jax_Gatsby,2021-04-05 04:35:12+00:00,"Except for silence, everything else is your imagination.","I'm sure some of us have experienced a deep silence and stillness while meditating. That silence is the only reality, everything else that comes up (thoughts, imagination, hallucinations, visons and so on) these are of the mind and therefore they are not real, regardless of how beautiful they may be. The psychological mind isn't to be trusted because it is deceptive, it builds you up just to knock you back down, that's the nature of the egoic mind. Only silence can be trusted because it is not an illusion or a dream, and everything else is born out of it.

In silence we are one with existence, but when thought comes up and we identify with it we fall back into the illusion of separation."

Sometimes only once, but mostly at least two times a day. It's absolutely incredible that it has had so much of an effect on me. I have less anxiety and stress and because of that, because of lack of neurotic thinking, I have had more energy to take on each day with a different perspective and a better out look. I still get mad, still get sad, frustrated, and lonely, but these emotions don't stay with me throughout the day. They don't drag me down and leave me feeling worse anymore.

PrettaaayPrettyGood,2021-04-05 02:40:33+00:00,First time meditation retreat suggestions,"Hi all, I am looking for some suggestions on weeklong meditation retreats for beginners. I am graduating from college in May, and post-graduation feels like the ideal time to do my first meditation retreat before nursing school.

I’ve only been meditating for several months now, but I’ll provide you with a bit of background. My meditation journey began once I finally convinced myself to start using the guided meditation app, “Waking Up” by Sam Harris. I have been a huge fan of Sam Harris for over a year now, and his app has shown me how life-changing the practice of meditation is. I know that he has been on multiple silent retreats, including one in China that lasted an entire year, which is inspiring to say the least.

I am looking for a weeklong retreat—preferably in California, but I’m also open to other options. I’m fully vaccinated, so I’m hoping all of these retreats aren’t still shut down due to COVID. 

Do you think a Vipassana/silent retreat might be a little too intense for my level of experience? If so, what other suggestions do you have for a first-timer? Any advice is much appreciated!"

Deep-Procedure-6759,2021-04-05 01:42:09+00:00,My first meditation experience,"Hello, I have been working through depression and anxiety for the last year and today I decided to try meditation. 

I closed my eyes and was just focusing on my breath. After a while I got to the stage where I was in a half asleep but awake. I kept a tab on how my body was feeling and I could not feel my hands (they were together in a praying thing but fingers intertwined if that makes sense. They felt like they were one thing and not two separate things. 

After 15ish minutes I started to feel like I was away from my body. Like It was just my head and I kept moving farther and farther back from my body. 

I also kept seeing this pictures in my head, there would be a golf ball that started swirling into a hurricane and then be gone in an instant, I would see weird shapes and green eyed babies and toddlers. I also kept seeing anime characters and unrecognizable faces. 

My eyes kept opening on their own and if I concentrated on keeping them closed I would lose that out of body experience so I taped them shut. 

After around 30 minutes of this I went to go have dinner and I felt as high as a kite. In such a blissful relaxation that I only felt after smoking an intense amount of weed. The highness slowly went away but 2 1/2 hours later I still am feeling ridiculously aware, calm, and slightly sleepy.

Let me know what you think because I am royally confused and curious. Thanks!"
BITTAH99,2021-04-05 01:15:23+00:00,Funny meditation experience,"Earlier today I went to a beach in England called Durdle Door that is surrounded by tall cliffs and huge hills everywhere. I found a nice big hill overlooking the ocean and saw a bench and decided to sit down and meditate. So I sat down and began meditating and focusing on my breath and just being present. I focused on the wind hitting my face and the sun on my skin, then brought the attention back to my breath. This continued for about 10-15 minutes before I decided to end the meditation. I opened my eyes and immediately gasped, yelled “WOAH!” and fell down to my knees and for about 5-10 seconds I had no idea what was happening. I got so deep into my meditation that I somehow forgot that I was sitting on top of a huge hill at a beach. It was probably the strangest meditation experience I’ve ever had but it was pretty funny once I calmed myself down."

ikolpi2000,2021-04-04 22:35:45+00:00,For those who is trying to seek true peace.,"True peace/happiness is not about trying to supress your emotion. Many people think that sitting down and meditate will solve all the problems, but it is not true. All it does is supressing that emotions by creating an illusion of peace. But once you lose that peace, you will return to your original state. Meditation like that is similar to doing weed or masturbating, but healthier. The way to achive ""unshakable peace or happiness"", you must let the emotion rise naturally and simply watch it (do nothing else). Once you completely sympathize (watching it without trying to supress, change, etc), you are free from it. You must watch your thought, emotion, body throughout the day (be watchful of it and do nothingelse). Watch it even when all the nasty thoughts arise (like you trying to kill someones, etc..). As long as you watch it, it does no harm to you. If you practice this well, even when someone yelled at you for no reason ( you would sympathize with them since you developed the wisdom). As a result, you will achive ultimate bliss even when you are in a big crowd. Nothing can change the peace inside you, nothing."

KundalinirRZA,2021-04-04 21:49:58+00:00,"Our physical and spiritual bodies, can hold trapped negative energy. That energy can be seen as trauma stopping us to act and feel certain ways.","

Chakra is a Hindi word meaning 'wheel'. The ancien Indian mystics saw the chakra centres of the body whirling, wheel-like vortices of energy. There are seven as major chakras or Energy centers and many minor or lesser ones. The minor chakras include the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet.

When these energy centers are clear and aligned, the Energy flows freely up and down the spine and through out the nervous system, resulting in a feeling of peaceful well-being. 

I've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force and many more.

Since we express ourselves through these Energy centres. They can, as well as our physical and spiritual bodies, hold trapped negative energy. Once tension, trauma, fears and anxiety are released from these Energy centers, the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual bodies also end up healing.

If you want to learn how to really tap into these centers with an effective method to heal them here's a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/vjV75hRXxDY) for you."
cookies19056,2021-04-04 20:42:10+00:00,A present day thanks to thought-writing,"This morning I woke and meditated in bed for a while. Then I remembered that some time ago I spent a morning writing down any thoughts that came, and I decided to do it this morning. So I carried around a pad and pen and wrote as many thoughts as I could whilst I went about my day.

They were mostly negative, which didn't surprise me, but what was good was that I started to try and have longer gaps between thoughts, so I'd have less to write. And the more the day went on, the better I felt. I became less scared of the thoughts and more accepting of the anxiety. I remembered to be mindful when washing up, and I had a great conversation with my mum on the phone. 

I'll try this tomorrow too. It was funny because a lot of the thoughts were along the lines of ""this is only working because I had a good sleep and it's sunny today, it won't be like this another time""

triplecyclonegames,2021-04-04 19:55:17+00:00,"Zero energy expenditure technique. ""I have zero energy available for mental resistance""","Hey friends! In the last days I've experimented with a new technique - I want to share it with you.

As you probably know most of the time mental struggle causes the most pain. It's not the anxiety or the feelings or the intrusive thoughts. It's the mental resistance we put up, the fight that prolongs and increases the misery.

So I figured - it takes energy to fight feelings/thoughts. What if you weren't willing to spend any more energy on those useless things? Because it takes ACTIVE energy to put up the mental struggle. Even if you're conscious or not about it. 

Following this train of thought I had the attitude: 

""I don't have energy available to spend fighting sensation/thought X"". 

""I'm not willing to spend any energy on fighting useless internal mental struggles"" 

and my favourite mantra that goes with it:

**""I have zero energy available for mental resistance""** 

Upon adopting this attitude consciously (along with the mantra above) I observed that some internal battles  died down. This resulted in a observable physical feeling of relief, especially in the chest/abdominal area. 

I made a note of this technique and I'll incorporate in future versions of Gamitate (no links but you can google it or click on my profile, it's a meditation game). Yay :) 

I have a couple more novel techniques and mental attitudes which seem to make a difference (which are not included in the Gamitate yet).

I'll share some of those as days go by, as not to overload you and give you time to practice! 

**TLDR: Internal struggle requires mental energy. Consciously withhold the energy (pretend you don't have any energy available for that) and the fuel for struggle will die down. Repeat the mantra: ""I have zero energy available for mental resistance""** 

Try this now if you feel like it! And please, let me know how this works for you in the comments!"

asksomequestionsing,2021-04-04 18:17:34+00:00,Reason for the lack of “progress”,"Hi all,


Just want to share something I noticed in my meditation today. I’ve been meditating regularly for about 5 months now, averaging around 25 min each session.


Today I sat for about 45 minutes and noticed the reason why I haven’t been able to move deeper into meditation: dissociation.


The first layer of dissociation that I had to move through were the distracting thoughts. I maintained awareness of my breathing and body as I moved through these thoughts. It has taken me some months to get past this layer, today.


Then I hit the layer of sensory and emotional dissociation. What it feels like is suddenly being dropped into a warm, silky bath where the outside world, including the senses, are tuned out. What tends to happen now is a shutting down of focus. By the time I become aware of my focus, I’m already 5 daydreams away, deep into some imaginary scenario.


So the tuning out happens concurrently with the daydreaming, which makes me believe that that was my primary defensive response to certain past events.


I noticed at some points today when I was able to get under that warm dissociative bath by bringing awareness to my chest/emotional centre (as much as I could), I would feel bits of fear, disgust, and panic bubble up. Then I would space out again and float back up to the layer of distracting thoughts.


That’s all that I have to share, thanks. Let me know if you have similar experiences!"

I tried picking a different spot to meditate in. I tried encouraging him to sit in my lap while I meditate. Sometimes this works; most of the time he insists on sitting just out of reach and then starting to meow as soon as I close my eyes. Choosing a different time of day, like during one of his naps, seems to be the best course of action. It's just slightly difficult remembering to do that as soon as I see him snoozing.

It has gotten a lot worse this last year because of extremely loud neighbors who blasts loud ""techno"" music almost everyday. I've done what I can (talked to them, left nice notes, filed a complaint). I'm trying to find another place to live, but I can't afford a more expensive apartment and I'm very low on the waiting lists on the cheaper ones. One day I'm getting a house in the country with sweet sweet tranquility.

But for now, I'm stuck. I can't control what happens in life, but I can control how I perceive and react to it. Therefore I'm trying to meditate everyday and when their music is louder than my own soft music, I put on headphones and try to focus on my own music or a sound book. I know it's a proces but it's so hard not to get sucked in and get anxiety attacks, worry about if the noise is there when I get home etc. But I'm trying my best.

If anyone has any advice that could help me get better at focusing on my inner body and not outer noises I would highly appreciate it. Today I just broke down and cried."

Recently I have been practicing the meditation where I would spend 10 minutes focusing on my breath only and trying to get rid from all other mental activities during those 10 munutes.

By googling I learned that this kind of meditation is called a mindfulness meditation and that its purpose is to improve attention and calm down emotions when doing a mental work. Also, I found out that there are present different from the mindfulness mediation kinds of meditations. And those different kinds serve different purposes.

Now I am curious to know all the basics of meditation including all its kinds. For that I would hope to find a well structured books which would introduce me to basic ideas/approaches one by one in a consistent manner."

I found it SO easy to just go completley mindless and really fall into my past emotions/trauma, within 5 or so minutes my eyes began twitching and tears streamed down my cheeks. I mentally faced my abuser of 6 years with fearlessness in early abusive scenarios and a huge rush of even more tears and emotion rushed over me. I know it may sound dramatic, but the experience seriously felt like I had just won a ""war"" with peace and conquering this ""trauma bond."" I had invisioned myself as a warrior, telling myself positive phrases reliving my past experiences.

My question is, what the HELL did I experience? and is this normal for a first timer? I'm honestly overwhelmed at how positively doing this ONE time has done for my mental health and I've already began looking into Buddhism!?"

The first step is called ""Right view"" which involves seeing the reality as it truly is, as described by the flawless wisdom being called the Buddha. Aspects of right view would include a belief in reincarnation, realms, that karma makes reality and gods and randomness do not exist, that freedom from suffering is possible and that the Buddha is the true  sage, superior to all others who peddle half-truths like Christianity or HInduism. Without right view all  meditation is going to do for you is lead to delusion.

melniqoff,2021-04-04 07:06:43+00:00,What makes the brain suffer?,"Hello, my friend. Today, I would like to share my findings with you about the brain and suffering. How does the brain make us suffer? Does the cure even exist? I've spent some time researching these issues, and I have found a lot of stuff that might help you to find answers to these questions.

I'd to say that **I am not a neuroscientist or psychologist,** but I am keen on these topics and dedicate much of my time to them.

### 

### Three brain networks

There are three main networks in our brains: the default mode network, the central executive network, and the salience network:

1. The central executive network is in charge of goal-oriented activities and cognitively demanding tasks. It is essential for problem-solving, decision making, and maintaining attention. So, when you pay attention to something, this network gets activated.
2. The default mode network is responsible for a lot of stuff but is mostly known for mind-wandering. It activates when you do nothing. Self-referential thoughts, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, judging people who have acted unfairly to you, the DMN is responsible for all of these. And by the way, **people with depression or ADHD have increased activity in the default mode network. \[1\]\[2\]**
3. The salience network is much unknown but responsible for switching between the default mode network and the central executive network.

The central executive network and the default mode network are anti-correlated. When one of these networks is activated, the other one deactivates. You cannot use them simultaneously. It means that if you are focused, you cannot ruminate anything in your head. You are free from this mental suffering. On the other hand, if you are not focused or mindful, you invite this self-referential stuff into your mental world.

### 

### The healing power of mindfulness

According to what scientists have found, in order to suffer less (or to be happier), we should reduce the DMN activity. In order to reduce the DMN activity, we should engage with the world, we should pay attention to things.

Let's take a look at mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness encourages us to engage with the world around us and pay attention to everything that arises in the present moment. When you start meditating, you pay attention to your breathing. The central executive network is activated. When you get distracted and start mind-wandering, you don't pay attention to anything. The default mode network is activated. Therefore, by meditating, you train your brain to live using the central executive network more and more. You are kind of creating a new default mode for your brain. On a psychological level, this curiosity, openness, and acceptance of the present moment help us to be connected with the world around us rather than with our thoughts.

Some people might say that it's not necessary to meditate since I can engage with the present moment when I am washing the dishes or driving my car. But from my experience, it's impossible to become **STEADILY** mindful without building a strong daily habit of meditation practice.

### 

### Problem-solving, decision making, and planning

Some people might also think: 'Well if my self-referential thoughts disappear how is it possible to plan the future, solve complicated problems and make decisions?'. As far as I can tell, real thinking is a hard process that requires our attention. When it comes to mind-wandering, it doesn't look like real thinking, it looks like a mental fart. I think that your own experience tells the same, but we can also refer to what some scientists talk about it:

1. **Gary Weber** is a scientist who has practiced more than 20,000 hours of meditation. He claims that more than 90% of the time he has no self-referential thoughts. Problem-solving and decision-making become much easier and more spontaneous (creative) for him than before since there are no such distractions as self-referential thoughts. \[3\]
2. **Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi** is known for the state of flow. \[4\] The most successful businessmen, scientists, and artists reported that great solutions come to their minds after intense concentration. When they get to the state of flow, they act spontaneously, without any efforts as if there is no self, no separation between them and their task. It's kinda short-term enlightenment, so to speak.
3. **Raichle Marcus** is known for the discovery of the default mode network. He said in an interview that when we talk intentionally, activity in the DMN is decreased. \[5\]

So, don't worry about planning, problem-solving, and decision-making. These things are getting better if you are mindful and focused.

### 

### Final words

I would like to say that there are many unexplored things about how our brain works. So, don't consider these videos, researches, and articles as the ultimate truth. It's an ongoing process. Nevertheless, from my experience, it seems solid. I meditate regularly, and it has changed my life a lot. I hope it helps and inspires you to start meditating or keep practicing. Have a nice day 🙂

My stress got so bad I decided to just sit down for 30 minutes and breath. My brain absolutely loved it!

I'd never felt such relief and for so long.

If I do 30 minutes in the morning, I'm usually good for the rest of the day.

I am finding often that I am cutting my sit time short, simply because it feels over. I am doing well with keeping my attention on my breathing, but it doesn't seem that interesting. My mind does wander, but I do my best not to engage my thoughts. Instead, I bring my attention back to my breathing. It just feels like breathing in the dark. I guess this is called dullness. So that's it. I will keep doing it. I am reading *The Mind Illuminated*, and it says the first step is to establish a routine. Keeping my sit time short is helping me to keep doing it everyday, so I guess I am doing that part right. I have done some longer sits, but it still just feels like breathing in the dark."

I never thought I would be able to detach myself enough from my thoughts and bodily sensations that I could passively sit through something like that.

Suspicious_Plant4231,2021-04-04 01:54:38+00:00,How do you guys feel about music while meditating?,"I've read and heard that music while meditating isn't the most ideal way to meditate. It forces your mind to multitask and all that. That said, today, I listened to music while I meditated and I can't tell if the result was helpful or not. 

I had a playlist that was literally called ""peaceful meditation"" on in my earbuds, and I sort of started daydreaming, but it seemed more intense. I completely forgot about the external world (which hasn't happened before) and focused on this daydream. It took place in a nice stone area in a lush green jungle-like biome. I was leading a group of people who were likeminded and had similar goals as I.  We all meditated and traveled together. There were four statues, three of them on each side of the area. At the back was a lion, fiercely looking up and roaring at the sun. Statues of a goat and snake that faced the inside of the area sat on either side of it, both looking straight ahead at the other. There was a forth statue, but it wasn't clear what it was. 

These three animals, when put together, form the mythical creature Chimera. It's sort of a symbol for me, as I often contemplate how each person has different parts of their being and their life, and they must be balanced (Like yin and yang, order and chaos). I tell myself to ""be like a Chimera"" because it's a fierce creature that is comprised of different parts, yet they all come together to create a force to be reckoned with. It may be dumb, but it helps me. 

Anyway, I saw what I wanted to happen in the future. I want to travel the world and gain a deeper understanding of myself. I want to meet people from all over, but most of all I want to meet people like me. I want to see different places and learn all I can from each place. I want to continuously better myself. This daydream, or whatever you want to call it, gave me more insight on what I want from life. That said, it could've just been a silly fantasy. 

So, what do you think? Does music help you meditate, or is no music more beneficial? Or both?"
sosmeditate,2021-04-04 00:41:32+00:00,What Does it Mean by Spiritual Awareness?,"**The Ancient Greek aphorism “Know Thyself” invites us to self-reflect; to look at ourselves and to understand our true nature, and having done so, to live our true nature. But what is our true nature? Are we simply the body that we come into this world with, that ages with time and withers away after death? Are we the mind that grows astute with intellectual pursuits only to evaporate at the time of death? Are we our emotions that change as frequently as the weather? Or is there much more to our “selves”? Is there something more constant, more powerful that defines our true self?**

 **Saints and spiritual Masters, since time immemorial, have come to remind us that we are much more than the body that we see with our physical eyes, much more than our mind or emotions. They tell us that our true self is the spirit or soul. They tell us that the soul is a part of God, the Creator and that it is the Power that enlivens the body, that animates us, that makes us tick. When this Power leaves us, the body becomes motionless, and we are proclaimed dead. Saints also tell us that there is a way for each of us to experience our true nature. It is not an intellectual pursuit, but one of practice, wherein we can have a direct experience of our true self.**

**Currently, we are asleep and ignorant of this truth. To become** [spiritually aware](https://www.sos.org/spirituality/spiritual-awareness/) **is to awaken to our true nature as spirit, to experience our true self. Spirituality is the process of discovering our true self. We normally think that perception is possible only through our bodily sense organs. Nevertheless, when we become spiritually aware, we recognize that we can perceive with the spirit.**

**An empowered soul** **is a soul that has recognized itself and is aware that it is** **the essence** **of** **who we really are, that is the guiding power behind the body and mind.–**[SANT RAJINDER SINGH JI](https://www.sos.org/sant-rajinder-singh/) **MAHARAJ**"

Some things i’ve read recommend for beginners to set timers and try to stretch their meditations from five minutes to ten, to twenty, to thirty, and so on.

Additionally, in the rare case that my meditation is interrupted by some external cause (someone opening the door/entering the room earlier than expected), I’m extremely jarred and can’t help feeling frustrated and upset, which very quickly negates the tranquility I was experiencing only seconds before. 

I know not much can be done for the latter other than trying to find a more private place where potential interruptions will be eliminated, but can anyone advise on how to retain the calm and not quickly feel frustrated/disappointed?

I've been curious about this subject, while searching online I could find some information on how to do it but I still have some questions. I'm interested in learning from someone that can do this already, if they could answer about some of the most wacky claims about khechari mudra. 

I do believe that it can trigger intense subjective experiences due to the nerve endings there are in that region, visions and hyper hemispherical synchronization. That part makes sense to me as it is something that has been demonstrated to exist for sure. And it's something that can be done in regular meditation as well. No mystery there.

 But I wanted to know why is it that yogis will say the nectar from khechari mudra will make it so that ***you no longer need to eat and will become immune to snake bites, disease, decay and death.***

That part is the point of this post, is this some sort of metaphorical text or figure of speech that everybody adopts?

I mean, it can't be literal otherwise we would see 500 year old yogis walking around, so what does this mean really to become immune from decay and death?"

For those unfamiliar with the film, the basic premise is that Adam Sandler's character has a remote control that allows him to fast forward through the parts of his life he doesn't want to experience, e.g. sitting in traffic, fighting with his spouse, being bored etc. Eventually, he fast forwards far enough into future only to realize that his life is in shambles. His marriage has fallen apart and he's utterly disconnected from his friends and family. During those times when he was in fast-forward mode, he was essentially on autopilot. He was there physically, but not *present*.

To me, this is the perfect metaphor for being lost in thought. When we're lost in thought, we're essentially on autopilot. We're having a conversation, but not really paying attention. We're laughing, but not experiencing the joy that laughter brings. We're with our family and friends, but not really engaged. 

I think about this movie often and remind myself to take the time to appreciate the fact that without meditation, one day I could look back on my life and notice that so much time has been spent consumed by thought that opportunities to enjoy the nuances of life have been missed. 

Remember my friends, every moment we're alive is a new moment  to be truly present and enjoy the things that are happening in the moment."

soniiiety,2021-04-03 15:44:45+00:00,here is my ways of meditating. the power of perseverance.,"First think of everything that is your thoughts and that is like negatives etc and accept and acknowledge  and then visualize it and let it pass through you like air.  


do not surrender to those thoughts, but become aware, once you have done that, direct it, to where it needs to be/belongs, then you can move onto using elements, like fire to cleanse and refine.  


visualisation is key to create some certain changes, next you want to ask a question or create the intent of what you want to create, empower it, then you can also visualize a cyan light from the center of the mind and move it downwards into the hand and feel it, breath  into it, breath out from it, then from one hand to the other, up back into the mind and into the subconscious, energize.  


from there you could gain a little insight from visions from daydreams, it could be a situational awareness thought, like what if? this happened etc.   
Done.  
whatever happens from there I wish you peace and vigilance

nolza95,2021-04-03 14:30:23+00:00,One simple yet powerful meditation technique," 

If you are a meditation expert, you can meditate lying down, walking, or sitting down.

But, if not, the fact that you sit down is very important.

It is easy to fall asleep when lying down and scatter when walking, so I usually sit down.

However, sitting posture tends to put a lot of strain on the back and legs, and this is the point.

The beauty of meditation is being psychologically very light, and becomes close to the state just before falling asleep, such as lowered brain waves, pulse, blood pressure, and breath. 

Pain in the lower back and legs is hidden behind the scenes by'not paying attention' due to the increase in blood concentration of anandamide and'pain control effect' due to the increase in endorphin. Among them, it triggers the hyperactivity of the vagus nerve, which is directly connected to the brain. Maybe this could explain Daejucheon or Kundalini.

Under normal circumstances, vagus nerve fainting may occur and fall, but the meditator maintains the same blood pressure and brain waves as if it had already collapsed, so I guess that the shock could trigger a shift in consciousness such as DMT endogenous generation.

Even if you can't get to this level, it's a pity that modern people can't quite feel the sensibility to melatonin, the melancholy, and the receptive state that you feel when you're seeing the change of brightness getting darker as the sun goes down in the countryside. Such an experience can be the simplest yet powerful meditation.

The meditation app' deFrown' was created with this background. Pivot from the meditation app to the wrinkles app, then back to the wrinkles + meditation app that taps and stretches both the body and mind. Turn off the lights before going to bed and Try 'deFrown', Test your ability to relax"
peaceiseverystepp,2021-04-03 14:21:41+00:00,Seven key attitudes for a happy life according to Jon Kabat Zinn,"**Non-judgment** - paying attention to your opinions as they arise. JKZ talks about how the human mind sorts things into boxes - good, bad, neutral. By taking a perspective of non-judgement and being aware we can take the most joy from the good things, accept the bad things (doing us less harm), and become more aware of the neutral things, realising how much they contribute to our lives. Of course judgmental thoughts still arise but we can simply observe them and let them pass without acting on them.


**Patience** - letting things unfold in their own time. Meditation isn’t difficult to learn but it does require patience and persistence. It takes some time to see the benefits of it, you need to stick with it. Doing it once a week is helpful but when you make time for a little bit of practice every day for six weeks the evidence shows its actually rewiring how your brain works, you’re training yourself to be happy. Its also about being patience with ourselves, not setting expectations for achieving a standard in a specific time, and being patient with others who have lived their life through a set of circumstances we’re not aware of. 


**Beginners mind** - seeing the world as if for the first time and seeing the infinite possibilities. Knowledge can limit our perception of what we don’t know, part of becoming wise (rather than clever) is getting comfortable with what we don’t know. When we accumulate a lot of knowledge and become jaded by experience we can lose touch with the joy in our lives.


**Trust** - listening to our bodies and our senses. Trusting that if we let go of anxieties about the future and regrets from the past and live in the present that everything will be OK - because it really will. When we cultivate trust in ourselves through practice, when we build our calmness and peace and live in the present moment  we start to trust other people more because we’re not jumping ahead to what they might do or questioning their motives - we’re existing in the present taking their words and actions at face value. Really listening to other people with an open mind is when we make strong human connections. 


**Non-striving** - we’re always trying to get somewhere, always running toward a destination. But an important aspect of mindfulness is realising that you have arrived in the here and now. We can’t live happily in the future; if everything we’re doing is to achieve, we sacrifice our wellbeing in the present. We tell ourselves we’ll be happy when we get promoted, we get married, we have kids, when we retire. This is the only time we can be happy - mindfulness is called the art of stopping, sometimes we have to ease off with the future plans and enjoy where we are and who we’re with.


**Acceptance** - accepting that things are the way they are. Which is not to say you don’t do anything about it, the idea is that you are aware in the present moment, you see things as they are and you can decide what it is you want to do. There’s a myth that mindfulness somehow makes you OK with injustice and suffering - the opposite is true! When we accept the world in front of us, accept people, accept yourself, you can act out of emotional intelligence and compassion rather than anger or fear. 


**Letting go** - by identifying the attachments we have we can trace the roots of our anger, our fear, our sadness and understand why we react the way we do in certain circumstances. Once we apply our awareness to our attachments we can start to understand ourselves, we can start to feel compassion for ourselves, then we can start to let go of our suffering.

massiveyacht,2021-04-03 12:07:53+00:00,Now I Am...,"This is a question I’ve started asking myself, in order to bring myself into the present. It’s making such a difference to my days, and making things that I’ve found quite hard a lot easier.

Often when I do chores, I’m angry and resentful. I think about all the things I would rather be doing. I huff and puff, and get distracted, and the whole task takes ages and is stressful and annoying. So I don’t really do a great job on the chore.

Then often when I try to relax, or do fun things, I’m worried and tense. I think about all the things I need to do, or ‘should’ be doing, and how little time I have to do them, and why aren’t I doing them NOW god damn it! Am I lazy or something? So I don’t really get to relax.

Now if I’m washing dishes, for example, whenever my mind wonders, or I get angry or resentful, I’ve tried saying to myself “now I am…washing dishes”. And I gently bring my attention back to the present moment, and the task in hand. This is what I’m doing right now.

And if I’m relaxing and watching TV, I say to myself ‘now I am…watching TV’, and I pay attention to the fact I am relaxing. This is what I’m doing right now.

It makes life a lot simpler, because now I only have to concentrate on one thing at a time. I’m worrying less about what I ‘should’ be doing, because I know everything has its time and place, and I know when I’m doing what I need to do, I will be concentrated and present.

The real challenge is staying present when you're going about your daily life in the world because the world is full of people who are only living on the level of the mind, identified with their egos so it's easy to get pulled back into that way of being.

A helpful practise is to remind yourself throughout the day to stay in the present and remain as the awareness, instead of getting entangled in thoughts, feelings and reactions."

adriadriando,2021-04-03 07:25:32+00:00,Meditation and Sleep/Dreams,"Hey everyone,

I'm a beginner at meditating (just over a month in) and I have to admit that I struggle to meditate every day– I usually only end up doing it maybe 4-5 days in a week right before I go to bed which is when I feel I have the most time and focus. Because I'm a bit inconsistent I've actually started to notice a difference in how I end up sleeping if I've meditated before or not.

If I don't meditate, it takes me a while to fall asleep (because my mind is focusing on unpleasant thoughts, no surprises there), then I sleep through the night but when I wake up I'm super groggy and stay in bed for a good hour or so in half-awake mode trying to get up/fall asleep again, which doesn't feel very good.

If I do meditate, I end up falling asleep much more easily and when I wake up I'm more alert and able to get out of bed in maybe 15 minutes. I sleep the same amount of time in both events BUT invariably every single time I meditate before bed, I wake up in the middle of the night from very vivid dreams, sometimes multiple times (not bad or good dreams, just strong enough to wake me up apparently).   

I'm not surprised that I fall asleep better and wake up feeling better after meditating, but does anyone have any insight or experience with the dreaming aspect? Waking up from vivid dreams has never been a common occurrence with me until just a week or two ago and I'm curious if it has something to do with the meditating right before sleep or maybe it just correlates to something else going on in my life right now!"

The past three times I’ve meditated, I’ve gotten into such a zone that my abs / core start churning in a clockwise motion. It is all involuntary - “I” feel like a narrator who is enjoying an amusement park ride. Today, I just allowed myself to go with the flow, as long as I could. For about 4 minutes, I sat on the edge of my bed, first swaying in a circular motion, then the direction shifted. It felt like I was being pulled forward and pushed backwards. The motion kept getting stronger and stronger. It was like the force moving me was external, and not internal. I recorded it, and (whoever “I” am) was able to narrate with my voice as it was happening. It felt like someone just “took over” control of my stomach. It ended with me just collapsing on the bed. 

This was such a wild experience. I do not feel scared about this - it was a peaceful  feeling. As if I was being taken care of by someone else. 

I am a skeptic. Before this happened, I would have thought anyone speaking like this had lost it. 

I really want to know if anyone else has experienced this while meditating, and whether you have thoughts on how to proceed if this happens again. For example, immediately “snap out of it” (I knew I could “take control” if I wanted to), or keep enjoying the feeling (not feeling in control was actually a freeing thing, plus I was enjoying what felt like a soothing ab workout).

Eg ""I Surrender"" to me means that the all the stress and issues from that point on shall be handled by the cosmos only and I only try to get one with the cosmos through my 15-20 min meditation session.

Then i follow this practice while day to day chores as well. Whenever i feel pressured. Just remind myself of the cosmic energies and tell myslellf that my share of the game is only my action and leave everything else to the almighty with pure Surrendrance.

Really glad if this helps someone.

Om Shanti 🙏

Sincerity_Amigo,2021-04-03 03:21:46+00:00,The potential for 1 million forests - is in 1 acorn,"How much potential do you think is inside of you right now? 

Everything is energy. You know this. All atoms are energy. All atoms in your body...100% pure energy. You are pure energy. Pure energy is unlimited potential. You are unlimited potential. 

Every atom in your body is the same age as the universe. 

You are unlimited and immortal. Science has proven this to you. Treat yourselves and everything around you as the unlimited and immortal beings that you all are and you get healthier, you get better looking, have better opportunities, which leads to more wealth, and because of your good mental health you are also having better relationships. Your universe will change. Pretty dramatically when you treat it like the infinite universe that it is. 

But because we are doing this dance together - we need each other. We are Interdependent. Not dependent. Not independent. Interdependent. If we treat it all perfectly - it will all be perfect. Technology and medicine can now treat most things that used to be impossible to live with. 

Find harmony with yourself  
Find harmony with your friends and family.   
Learn to harmonize with strangers.  
Study what brings harmony to your environment and home.   
Find what it means for your brain to be in harmony. Meditate on it. What does it feel like when your brain is in harmony? Just tell your brain ""I am harmonizing now"" as you meditate. Then proceed to do whatever comes to you in that moment as you follow your breath. 

Let go of everything. Just harmonize with the present moment. You do not need anything in this moment, except harmony. Admit it. That is what you want. You want complete inner peace. So harmonize. Once you learn to harmonize your brain, then you can start to take that around your environment and then around people. You do at least one thing where your brain is able to find harmony. Painting, dancing, laughing, holidays, vacations, church, prayer, meditation, yoga, orgasms, LSD (if a good trip), surfing, basketball, Whatever makes you happy. Your brain is fully in the moment and harmonizing. That's a feeling you made with your brain. Not the thing itself - you. It was all you. You don't need it. Its there to show you that its possible and all you need to do is pay attention to how your consciousness is reacting in those moments. Study your breath in those moments. Study your body. How does your brain feel? Which parts are lighting up? Really pay attention when you feel happy. That's harmony. Cultivate it through meditation and doing more of the things you love. Its that easy. Just do what you love and brings you to harmony with yourself and your environment. Seems like heaven to me. The day still seems pretty beautiful and the night seems pretty beautiful.

Nature is in harmony, as long as its there it is in harmony, because its natural. It doesn't think about it. It just does nature. If you leave it alone it will produce rainforests, jungles, elephants, duckbilled platypus, venus fly traps, and all sorts of cool stuff. You don't have to do anything. Just leave it alone. Isn't that cool? You can go visit - but when you are there you s- find harmony with it. 

Try a mediation on harmony. Imagine yourself like one of those Tesla balls. Feeling the electricity coming off every part of your body and brain as you float in harmony with your mediation area. Watch a video online of one. The way it seems to be in perfect harmony. Feel it through your whole body and through your hair. Feel it through your spine and chest.  Feel it underneath you. Feel your whole body in perfect harmony. Pay attention to how this feels. If you can take that feeling with you throughout your day, it makes for a really enjoyable experience. All the time. Everywhere. All you have to do is try and you can learn to harmonize all day long. Floating around like a Telsa ball is fun. Its how you feel when you are truly happy. Light on your feet. Light in your heart. You can feel it. Its like a tightening on your chest.

It takes study. Learn what helps your body and mind harmonize. Write it down. Learn what helps your relationships harmonize. Write it down. It just takes you to want to do it. The effort is all on you and its as easy as getting a notebook and pen. Because once you have those you have already made the decision to find harmony. And the universe will give it to you if you ask. If youre sincere about it. Dont you want harmony in your everyday life? Peace, love, and joy - every single day. Your life in total harmony. If we all do it, then we can reduce the risk of creating more disharmony. So follow your dreams, do what you love, and find harmony. That's pretty fun."

But the one kernel I can’t seem to overcome is jealousy of other/envy of others/coveting their success and joy. It keeps me stuck in a very angry depression. I don’t feel good enough or like I’ll never have those things I want because I’m a bad person. I feel like I don’t have enough in my life and that I’m being left behind.

Physical illnesses may be treated with medicines but soul, which controls our morale, motivation and happiness, cannot be cured with scientific measures. To evaluate your emotions and bring harmony to feelings, you must practice meditation along with other tasks of your life. It relaxes your nerves and muscles and brings peace to your inner structure, which allows greater efficiency in other activities.

Although it's an intangible mechanism, sill there is some themes that are followed for each distinct technique of meditation. It starts with understanding your own self, the pattern of nature and how both work coherently to bring peace. So instead of beginning the meditation practices [randomly,read about the philosophy and underlying rules of that particular activity.](https://glitzland.blogspot.com/2021/04/meditation-for-beginners.html)

Once you start believing in unseen structures, you get to step closer to the higher purpose of life. This allows you to stay composed regardless of present condition of your life. Meditation enhances control over feelings and allows you to utilize them for your greater benefit. The moment you become aware of your inner personality traits, you can behave in a more optimistic and constructive manner thus nurturing your social relationships. When your mind becomes healthy, it casts positive impacts on your body and you feel active and competent than before."

So letting my feelings out and not holding them back. I dont understand this because in those moments I just want everything to stop (especially the hurting) even though that I know those are just my real feelings . I dont know if I should go see a therapist or not, I dont know anything really. I would appreciate ;) some advice especially if keep on meditating will help me understand it."

weIIokay38,2021-04-02 20:14:16+00:00,Why would I want to 'observe the observer'?,"I've been doing the Sam Harris Waking Up course lately, and the past few episodes just haven't made any sense to me. He's started talking about 'observing the observer' and 'looking for the thinker', and... I just don't want to?

The reason why I meditate is because I want a tool that can help me handle my anxiety, the mood swings that come from ADHD, and the *incredibly* intrusive thoughts that come with my OCD. That's all I care about. Thanks to my anxiety, I already have a severely distorted picture of reality (I experience a **ton** of dissociation and derealization), and all these episodes do is trigger that. 'Looking for the observer' sounds like it's putting me back in that space, and *I don't want to be in that space*.

I like feeling centered. I like feeling connected to my body. Meditation fixes dissociation and derealization for me, and I don't want to 'ascend' beyond that. I don't care if humans are biological state machines, if I'm 'connected to the universe', etc., I just want a tool to manage my own mind malfunctioning. When I see people talking about 'ego death' on here, and how they've 'ascended past the self' or something like that, it just kinda triggers my anxiety and makes me feel like it's neurotypical people trivializing the experiences I've had with my dissociation and derealization.

Just wanted to get that off my chest. Is it okay in meditation for me to just stick to one level? Is it okay for me to just stop where I feel comfortable? I *like* my ego, I like the part of me where I feel centered and where my limbs feel like they're part of my body and where the world feels real, that's the kinda experience I want, because the alternative is **fucking terrifying** to me and quite literally hell. Is there something I'm missing here?"
hoborat,2021-04-02 19:52:15+00:00,Any advice for beginner stuck in early stages of meditation?,"I had some very intense experiences using psychedelics and meditating, I become aware of the years of suppressed emotions almost instantly and simply breathe into them, and cry everytime, after crying I start laughing so hard at the amazing pleasure of relief and it's like a giant curtain gets pulled over and life becomes magical. One experience stuck with me on an accidental dose of 6 dried grams (planned to be 2.5) I went through what felt like several layers of consciousness that ended in exhaustion, my mind was still, there was no thought. I just was present, being in the moment and I didn't move or think and the bliss and love I felt is something I know now is all I want to achieve in this life.

But it is not transformative, it gives me a glimpse of what could happen though I truly believe if I can get some habits and discipline going it would help immensly, or to just experience some emotions lol. As my mind takes over and my habits realign themselves and the ego takes over, I have 0 discipline of my mind it's completely untamed and extremely restless, but it feels so damn hard to meditate while completely in the survival state of mind, it's so numb inside and noisy it does feel impossible to break the giant barrier I built to protect myself growing up from the crazy shit I could write about I had to deal with and all. Basically suppression was my ultimate survival tool dealing with abusive people.

I just can't really express how much of a slave to my mind I am, it feels so restless, I got constantly told I have adhd and I will admit I can be really manic when i'm even a little bit happy. and manically depressed i've tried to kill myself in simple thought loops. I

In other words is there a route or a practice anyone could point me to for a type of person who possibly has unusual amounts of thoughts, like crushing amounts that for months tries everyday to meditate but can't get passed a minute without getting crushed by the millions of thoughts I'm having. Or is this normal and I just need to keep trying what i'm doing? 

Thanks"

I practiced for a brief period years ago, then stopped.  I have begun my practice again and had been consistent for 3.5 months up until a couple weeks ago.  As I stated in the title, I have always felt an obligation when I do it, never a desire, often times even a dread whenever I know the time to meditate is approaching.  

I know mindfulness is a key to living a more harmonic, natural and peaceful life.  I just have no desire to sit down at any period of the day and meditate.

I use the 10 Percent App when I meditate and have found the concept of mental noting (ex: when you realize that you are thinking, say the mental note in your head, “thinking”) from the primary teacher I am following (Joseph Goldstein) to be beneficial.  But I do not like the repetitive nature of the practice using the app.

snorlaxerr,2021-04-02 19:06:47+00:00,Is it all about strengthening pre-frontal cortex?,"Around 2 years ago I used to be super chill. I used to be frequent weed smoker.
Whenever I smoked weed, I felt the effects all over my brain.

Until a year ago I used to be super stressed. I was convinced my prefrontal cortex was gone and was ready to get a brain scan, until a doctor told me it is nothing but my stress, because whenever I smoked weed, I would feel every part of my brain except frontal. 

Whenever I meditate and try to focus on my body, I feel the lower back part of my brain deactivating &amp; my frontal part activating. I feel more relaxed. 

Now when I smoke weed, I feel something in my frontal part too, tho not as much as I used. I am very very de-stressed compared to a year ago.

So, my question is - Is meditation all about strengthening your pre-frontal cortex so you can manage your stress better and be present in the moment?"

I was going through one of the daily guides and the focus was on gazing into the space behind your eyelids. Sam was talking about focusing on the thoughts that arise, and I had a few flash by. Stupid things, like a potato (idk why lol), what my living room looked like before I left the house, or nothing which let me focus on the darkness behind my eyelids. But for a second or two, I felt like I teleported to another place. I could see white, sun-bleached sand all around my vision field. There were blue skies in the background and not a cloud in sight. Directly in front of me was a small, skinny palm tree. I could hear seagulls and waves crashing behind me. I could smell the salty air. And as quick as it came, the beach scene was gone. I was then focused on the dark space behind my eyelids again. 

Is this a normal part of the practice? I didn't recognize the beach I was on, but it felt so real. Honestly, it was super refreshing. Wish I was able to spend more time there!"
genbuggy,2021-04-02 17:09:08+00:00,Questions about meditation for my newbie husband and my more experienced self,"I have been meditating on and off for several years.   I have been encouraging my husband to join me in this adventure since I began.  In early February, after we were both very stressed about a tragedy in our local community, my husband decided that he wanted to join me in daily meditation. 

I have experimented with a number of different meditation techniques over the years but have never been formally taught or found a specific technique that absolutely resonates with me.  I am open to trying lots of methods.   

The only time we can meditate together is immediately after our kids go to bed at night.   We have meditated together every evening since February 9.  We sit in a quiet, dimly lit room together and set a timer (currently for 20 minutes).  

I have decided to let him take the lead on figuring out which approach he prefers since I dont want to influence him (and I can easily convince him to do most things).  We have followed a few guided meditations.  We have tried awareness of breath.  We have done a couple of mantra based sessions.   Last night we followed a guided Metta meditation.  He doesn't love any of them.  After each session I will ask if he enjoyed that technique and he is always rather insure.  He also doesn't see any significant changes from almost two months of consistent practice.  He is committed to doing this practice daily because he has heard countless accounts of its importance but he wants some input on how to best go about finding his personal style. 

As for me, I have developed, over the years, a personal approach that I like.  I have found since meditating with him however, that I don't go nearly as ""deep"" as I used to when I meditated alone.   Although I have some ideas as to why I'm feeling this, I'd be open to hearing opinions about this from others.

Since I'm consciously working to keep my opinions out of his journey, I thought I would ask this community to share their thoughts and experiences on different types of meditation and specific strategies for a newbie that is way out of his comfort zone.   Your constructive feedback is greatly appreciated."

Though, (bear with me for a second as I explain...)I’ve recently signed a new lease agreement and I’m in the process of moving. We are renting a rather rundown old place for super cheap, and happy to do some repairs. I’ve noticed a few things about the building managers already such as asking them to get our carpet deep cleaned prior to move in (required in BC for tenancy longer than 1 year if carpet flooring) and the day we got the keys, the manager left pretty quickly (didn’t do a damage inspection form)... so I examined the carpet and it still had old pet barf on it. He just vacuumed and tried to play it off as if they “got” it cleaned... anyway, back to how this ties into meditation. I’ve been unable to sleep, laid awake for 4+ hours last night just ruminating on all the work that needs to be done and these stories I was making up about potential conflict with the managers, or other tenants in the building (3 story house, 1 unit per level). I’ve never had this much trouble with ruminating thoughts and stress keeping me up... any ideas as to why my practice has seemed to make this aspect worse? I tried to focus on my breath to fall asleep, but it was like I was unable to catch myself drifting into these stories... any ideas? Tips?"

I struggle meditating when I am stressed about work or personal life issues. Any tips? I understand that it's all in the mind and to ""let go"" but it's hard to do that in reality when you have responsibilities.

Here are some examples:

- When there are tight work deadlines or issues at work.

Even after switching off my laptop, I find it hard to actually switch off mentally. I find myself thinking about what frustrated me, or the incomplete state of ""work"" that I am supposed to finish off etc.

I struggle to concentrate in meditating, my mind is drifting towards some of the thoughts above and I am generally feeling very unpleasant inside.

Does anyone have tips please?

When everything is at peace and under control and life seems hopeful, meditating is fantastic."
_TheRedWolf,2021-04-02 13:13:17+00:00,"When I meditate I can't stop focusing on an specific part of my stomach, and even my mind moves the focus constantly when I breath, making me uncomfortable and anxious.","I describe it as a dense ""energy"" fluid, moving constantly around my stomach. I was supposed to focus on how my stomach goes up and down, how it expands and then retracts, and that was what I did when I started meditating.

But then, my mind started distracting with, as I described before, a mental fluid that is constantly moving, it's like an imaginary puppy in my abdomen. Sometimes it moves to the left, sometimes to the right, it's never in the middle of my stomach, where my belly button is located. Also, I can't control that ""energy"", it moves on its own.

It's weird. I searched about this but I couldn't find any other case as similar as mine. 

I only feel it when I try to meditate. Rather, I feel it when I simply focus on my stomach. It doesn't affect other areas of my life, just on meditation.

What should I do? Should I move to another type of meditation, or just continue focusing on that energy?"
Matino,2021-04-02 12:57:53+00:00,How to apply mindfulness,"Hi,

During times of frequent practice I sometimes get a sensation og ""waking up"". I become conscious of my actions, but I am unsure how to handle this. For example I can notice an impulse to scratch my head, I can notice the want, or I ""catch"" my hand moving towards my head. What should I do in this situation? Should I just scratch my head? How can I apply the mindfulness in daily life? The same goes for other impulses such as poping joints or small movements, maybe I over time can reduce these impulses. 

In addition I can at times notice that I am thinking, but I'm unsure what to do with this. I notice that I am thinking and can get some distance to the thoughts, but does this have an implication that I don't know? Should I monitor my thoughts and actions? Or just let things be and observe them? 

I have also noticed this in conversation with others, there as well I am unsure. What I have been trying to do in that situation is to direct my attention to the person speak, which I think is a good usage of awareness. 

Thanks in advance for any insight."

antichrome69,2021-04-02 12:00:21+00:00,Death is our greatest teacher,"I have read Michael Singer's ""Untethered Soul"" 18-20 times for the last 2 years and I want to share what I learned that 200% boosted my journey to Buddha. Excuse my grammar (SSSORRYY).

""Death is our greatest teacher"" is such a cosmical paradox. No humans or happenings can teach you more than death does. A wise person knows that moment where you will take your last breath will happen whenever and wherever. A wise person accepts the fact that we can die whenever and wherever. If someone were to teach you how to get rid of your obsession, death solves it by just taking it right away. If someone were to teach you how all lives are equal, death instantly put all lives equally. But, will you just be waiting for it to come when we have that power in ourselves to be awakened? If there is something miserable happening in your life right now, try thinking about death. Let's say you are very insecure and hate seeing your BF/GF talking with others. But is it really right for your loved one to be not loved by anyone and living a lonely life? If you can let your selfishness down for a moment,  you will realize that you wish your loved one to live an abundant life with no doubt. If that is what you truly want, why all the fuss about your loved one talking to others? To motivate yourself to live in a higher-self, death must be with it. Why must you learn the way to higher-self when everything is taken away? A wise person thinks, ""If everything were to change from one breath, I will live in higher-self for the rest of the life. I will not hurt my loved ones. I will be fully honest and live in my deepest side of my existence. "" This is an attitude you need to have deeper and meaningful relationships in your life. Look back in your past time when you treated harshly or rather bitterly to your loved ones. It could be the morning when you yelled at your mom. It could be when you acted selfishly to your friends. We think they will be there for your all the time. It is very difficult to grasp. But what if they die now? What if YOU die? What would you do if the night sky you see right now is the last time you will be seeing your loved ones? Imagine grim reaper comes during your sleep and tells you to pack everything up because, in the next morning, you will be leaving? Then the people you met on that day will be the last time you will be seeing them. Forever. How would you feel? What would you talk about with them? You wouldn't even care about their wrong if it's the last time you will be with them. How much love would you be able to express in your last moment? You will look at your life very differently. Now, we must deeply realize this. Death is not to be creeped out or be scared of. Death is the greatest teacher out of all out there. You don't need to get nervous in front of death. Knowing and accepting death will make you live like every moment in your life matter. As every moment is precious. Even now where you are facing difficulties. A person who knows there is only a week to live will treat every moment in that person's last week very special. That last week will be a million times more meaningful than his/her entire life. What would it be like to live every day like this? A really awesome thing when you accept this deep truth is that you don't need to turn your whole life upside down. You just need to change the attitude towards death. For example, you are a person who takes a walk like million times, at a park. But how many times have you actually experienced the joy from it? Imagine a person who has only a week to live asks a doctor, ""Can I go outside and take a walk?"", ""Can I look upon the sky for the last time?"" Even if there are storms, he/she will be willing to go out for a walk. It is the most important thing for them to do in their last week. However, you hate storms. You either run or use an umbrella. What is it that makes you feel like you are not living? What is it that makes you so scared? We keep ourselves so busy and try so hard so the next thing will go smoothly. We don't live in the present moments. Don't you want to truly LIVE before death comes? There will be no warnings. It is extremely rare for a person to know when he/she will die. Most of us will fail to realize that there is no next breathe. Use your every day, every moment to let go of the fear that stops you from living in present. Because you know death will come to you no matter what, speak the whatever the FK you want. Do what you need to do without hesitation. Don't worry about what would happen next. Turn your awareness to present moments. This is the life of someone who knows and accepts death. You must be able to live like one because you are also facing death as well. Don't be scared of death. Let it be the key to your freedom for your soul. Receive the courage to live your life wholly from death. ""You"" are simply experiencing what is happening. It is not about hoping something to happen. Don't waste your time trying your ass off to make the next thing happen. Be thankful and savor every moment. Live your life as if you are on the edge of the cliff because we all are."

What an interesting and inspiring community!

I am starting with meditation (did it already long long time ago for about a week), and i have a main goal:

Every time i have a big event i get anxious and stressed, and mostly about the sleep i get the night before. This in turn keeps me awake, which is a vicious circle that i really hate. 

Examples: last year my birthday, i had to get up early and had a party in the evening. I got so stressed about my sleep (and the early waking) that i got kind off panic attacks about my sleep.

And now: next week i have a job interview (at 14.00h, so not even early). I already feel my stomach and chest stressing about the sleep (and NOT the interview). 

I know there are a lot of benifits in meditation, and not to speak less about allllll these benefits, but will mediation (and being more mindfull) help me with my main goal do you think?"

Even on anxiety medication I still feel restless and uneasy, I struggle to cope with my anxiety even after regularly practicing meditation. I want to accept every aspect of myself but it’s difficult for me, I try to watch my thoughts but I can only do so for so long, my anxious thoughts don’t disappear they just get replaced by other depressive/anxious thoughts so watching them seems counterproductive imo. But I’m no meditation guru so what do I know? I don’t like watching thoughts because I never could get that feeling like I’ve separated myself from them, it still feels like I’m being brought down by them.

Even if I watch a thought til it disappears there’s a 70 percent chance they next thought will be negative. I KNOW that my thoughts aren’t factual but I still feel them as if they are. For example if I watch the thought “I’m so sad, why am I sad, why can’t I accept myself and give myself love?” Watching this thought doesn’t do anything and no matter how hard I try to be the observer of this thought I just can’t.

I just want to love myself and except my thoughts and emotions as they are, but no matter what I do I still don’t fully feel that love for myself."

chocolate__crab,2021-04-02 04:59:18+00:00,Meditate like airborne fighter pilots during dogfighting!,"I read in a book that fighter pilots make fast and accurate decisions under such high g-forces with something called an 'OODA' loop. 
O - Observe
O - Orient
D - Decide
A - Act
(Repeat) 





I have experimented and come up with a similar cycle that keeps me tranquil and mindful during meditation. The results are mind-blowing. 


This loop also contains 4 elements whose execution is to be repeated sequentially.

1) Be aware of all thoughts.

Yet try to not get involved(dwell) in those thoughts. Do not judge those thoughts. Do not spend any intellectual resources on those thoughts. 



2) Regardless, If you do realize that you're dwelling or judging any thought(s), just distract yourself from it instantaneously and deliberately.

For helping the distraction process, you can momentarily open your eyes to see a candle or a wallpaper with white dot in a black background. If you don't have such physical distractions, you can simply ""visualise"" a white tiny dot floating in a dark background of space/nothingness. Whatever be the method of distraction, the objective here is to break the involvement with your thought(s).



3) Be aware of the relation between current thought, previous thought and the upcoming thought.

Most of the times, thoughts occur as a chain of ideas. Even if one thought pops up, out of nowhere, the next one might be related to the first one. Realizing the common attribute(s) of the consequent thoughts can help you better distract yourself from that chain of ideas. But I must caution you, do not spend too much of your intellectual efforts on this third element. Do not even dwell on it. For this is just a ¼ part of the loop that is to be repeated several times.



4) Discern meta-cognitive thoughts

This element is specifically dedicated to one peculiar type of thought. That's metacognition. There is good chance that you'll get involved in something called a feedback loop or ""thinking about thinking."" The last step of this loop is look out for any such thought processes going around and terminate them. Use the methods of distraction in element 2 if needed.



Now repeat this loop.


As hard and long the above might seem, it's just for explanatory and comprehensive purposes. But I execute each iteration of this loop in just a few seconds. With practice even you'll be able to. And the results will amaze you. I'm a 22 yo undergraduate student from India. Do write to me, if you need any further clarification on the above method.
Good luck and happy meditating!"
gwendolynrb,2021-04-02 04:23:16+00:00,How awareness brings growth (a thought process),"Ive recently had a focus on just noticing and having an awareness around what the contents of my thoughts are... and Im developing a big fat crush on someone

so my thoughts have been a lot of fantasies and scenarios and its made me start to think about how being so infatuated with this person is a way for me to not experience reality to its fullest, a way for me to numb out essentially.

 And its quite interesting because now I am wondering why am I numbing out or a better question, what am i numbing out? 

I just moved across the country 2 months ago and I think Ive finally come face to face with the overbearing loneliness that comes with living alone for the first time and moving days away from all your family and friends.

and so ive delt with this loneliness by finding someone to obsess over and I can think and daydream of happy carefree fantasies with this person anytime I might feel lonely and then I dont have to acknowledge or experience these negative feelings. 

I dont know how im supposed to sit with this loneliness, I feel frustrated with myself and I feel lost and I dont know how to move forward. 

... in the past what ive done is given myself an intentionally emotional outlet, like making myself cry by listening to sad music. Im not sure if it helps, part of me thinks its just an excuse for me to ""be over and done with it"" like if I let myself experience the hurt for 15 minutes it will go away and stop hurting. 

on the bright side all this is a wonderful example of my growth, the fact that I can recognize whats happening instead of just deteriorating. 

I also worry that this might be a reoccurring theme in my life with my tendency to not stay too single for too long... is it all just a constant repression of a deep loneliness? and if thats the case, what can I do to help with this? how does one go about unlearning such a thing? 

I guess its to continue to catch myself in the act of these thoughts and patterns... and then to combat them, to do something else, to come back to the present moment. Stop the train in its tracks over and over again until it doesn't see the point in running anymore. and I guess thats growth."

After suffering with some insomnia and my usual nightly meditation/astral projection sessions were not helping, I decided to during the day have a session not in my usual place (front room) and blasted some meditation music through my surround sound system.    

The purpose of this sessions was to manifest abundance in wealth - specifically the Euro Millions £120 million Lottery Jackpot for today (and I absolutely and wholeheartedly believe I will become a millionaire when I play the lottery today) however during this meditation I astral projected a little (kind of teleported around the house in different seats in different rooms) and then all of a sudden I was swimming through the sea at speed. The water was gorgeously deep blue and I could see I was swimming with wild life. It cause I was travelling at speed it didn’t feel like I was human, as the ocean felt deep and vast yet we (myself and the other wildlife around me) was only a few feet from the surface. It’s was so beautiful and so real, I could even see the individual bubbles created through our powerful yet graceful movements through the waters. I also noticed it felt like as I was moving my head/vision was spearheading through the waters and my body was behind (at the back) kind of like a dolphin I suppose? This last about 5 seconds until it faded the I’d go back to being in some random part of my house and then it would fade back in after a few moments and this repeated about 5-10 times.       

It was a really profound experience and I’m trying to understand what it means! Does anybody have any ideas or similar experiences? I don’t believe it was me taking form of my spirit animal as I believe that Is a snake (I’ve had many dreams whereby I’m kind of slithering around like a snake) and when I walk in the dark I get worried that I’m constantly going to fall over and it’s like I constantly have a silver snake slithering around my ankles in a figure of 8.        

Really hope is don’t sound too out there as there experiences are very vivid! Any thoughts and guidance would be greatly appreciated!"

joestrwrs,2021-04-02 02:10:27+00:00,“Who am I?”,"When I was a kid, probably around age 9 or 10, I used to sometimes wonder very deeply about my mind. I distinctly recall thinking about thinking itself and my mind. And then I would wonder to myself, “wait, who am I? No, like who is asking that question? What is behind all of my movements?” And then I would look at my hands and move them and just observe in awe that I was making that happen. And then one time, while I was doing this, I suddenly entered into this spooky out-of-body type experience that made me feel disconnected with my body. I remember having a sense of “seeing” my body from above (though I wonder if this particular memory is a suggestive memory from years of TV and stories of these types of things). 

While this experience was going on, I remember hearing my dad’s voice in the other room and understanding that it was my dad, but in another way not really being familiar with it. And within a few seconds I would come back to reality, pretty shaken.

This intrigued me as much as it frightened me. And so I recall doing it intentionally a few times after that over the next few years. I could induce it by thinking (and maybe even saying) the question “who am I?” very intently and looking in the mirror as I did it. 

To me, this was always kind of my rosebud  - I would try to explain it to people over the years and they never really understood me. But it has fascinated and terrified me all of my life.

I have been getting into meditation and mindfulness practice recently and it seems like what I was doing was seeing the dissolution of the self. Transcending the self perhaps? In the Waking Up app, Sam Harris described an experience (perhaps quoting Harding’s the Man With No Head) that was eerily similar to what I remember.

What’s interesting to me is that I cannot and have not been able to “achieve” this since I was probably like 12. It may be of note that I started taking ADHD and SSRI medications around the time I used to have these experiences and have taken them all of my life since. So perhaps there is some barrier there.

But I just wanted to share this in case anyone else has had this experience."

My biggest trouble is my mind always begins to wander and I lose my meditative state in only a few minutes. 

I’ve found what might be the perfect solution for my busy mind. Trataka Meditation. Focusing on the flame of a candle to promote concentration. This has worked wonderfully for me thus far! I often pair trataka meditation with certain frequencies or binaural beats playing in my headphones. I have never been able to successfully clear my mind for more than 5-10 min at time. With this method, I’ve found myself in a meditative state for 20-30 min. 

While gazing at the flame, I often see images. The most recent and most vivid image that appeared to me was an elephant standing in front of a giant “tree of life”. I’ve also seen butterflies, mountains and an image of what seemed to be someone waving at me. This immediately made me think of my grandmother and that perhaps she was saying hello.

I've recently hit this point where it's like I keep seeing my thoughts and how the constantly try to me suffer. For example, I was at the doctor for oral surgery and was waiting for over 30 minutes inside without my phone. During this my mind would occasionally think angrily like ""what is taking so long! I want my phone. Ugh"". But it's like anything I would think that I would think notice and be like am I really causing my own suffering then just laugh. 

Stuff like that happens a lot now. It's funny because sometimes I won't be able to control a thought or emotion but I still feel the underlying feeling of ""don't create your own suffering"" but it's just to strong to completely control or stop, but it won't have much of a grip as it used to. Therefore, the emotion or thought fades away with much less effort than before. (Not saying I'm perfect now, because I definitely still lose temper and get caught in my emotion and thoughts still)

Honestly mediation has helped my life so much. I went from the classic lazy college student living at home to a person who has a strict schedule from 8am - 7pm. I think the biggest thing it taught me was that all value judgments people place aren't real, and is completely subjective . This is probably the knowledge that helped me be less attached to thoughts and feelings. Because while I still take them seriously and into consideration, I don't feel the weight of them controlling me as much."

EitherCartoonist1,2021-04-01 22:34:44+00:00,Non-mindfullness meditation. One example.,"This is a comment from a post. But it also is very much a powerful use for meditation that is not mindfulness or awareness.

Meditation for assessing and fixing problems in life.

_______

When you fight a monster do you run away? Not if you are to defeat that monster.

A mistake made is to find escape from the things that are issues. One of the uses, so commonly, of meditation is to run from life issues. Living in the moment. Even the desire to use meditation to create happiness. It is as a drug. Temporary.

Another less common use is to use meditation to analyse a problem. To really over think it. Find what ever detail that can change your opinion of the problem you find. One of the mysteries that meditation unfolds that a lot of people repeat is that a problem is found only in your head and not in reality. As an illusion.

But in reality that problem still exists. In reality that problem is in your head but it is also in your life. To meditation on life issues is to find the proper detail you need to change your situation. Often times it is a small detail of how you are thinking of the situation. That's where it is true that the problem is an illusion. But that still means you have to find that solution.

Because the problem is in your head and the only way to fix it is to fix your thought pattern.

Way of the rock. One never avoids an issue. One looks it directly in the eyes and makes it move like water around itself so the problem does not effect the one.

Meditate to fix your problems in life. Not to escape them."

tstaffordson,2021-04-01 20:18:53+00:00,Loving Kindness- sharing my experience from my session today.,"Something amazing happened in my practice today.  I feel compelled to share.

This afternoon, instead of doing my usual mindfulness meditation, I decided to branch out and try to add some variety to my routine.  Using a meditation app (Medito) I randomly selected a Loving Kindness session by Giovanni Dienstmann.  In this session, the whole focus was on cultivating and fully immersing one's self in Loving Kindness.  

It wasn't my first experience with a loving-kindness session, but it was the first time I was able to fully connect with and feel what I will have to describe as pure, unconditional love for myself.  

In the \~13 minutes I was sitting, I laughed, I cried, I felt physical sensations of near ecstasy and catharsis.  It was one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had (period). Long-suppressed memories of first loves and remembered moments of joy came rushing back in waves.  They reminded me, that I wasn't always so closed off and guarded... that I wasn't always afraid to express love or to fully love myself.  It made me realize just how much I have hidden from my own view out of some fear of being too vulnerable and just how amazing and powerful love truly is.

Anyway, thank you all for allowing me to share... I hope it helps someone else out there, who like me, is just trying to figure it all out.

**I'd love to hear from all of you about any similar or related experiences.**

As for me,  I am going to go kiss my wife and child and then call my Mom.

Much Love!

*\*Addendum:  I don't know if I can credit my experience to a single app, guide, or session.  I am certainly not trying to sell or promote anything here... I did want to relay important details, just in case, they might be a help to others.  My experience is likely a result of many factors including my years-long journey exploring meditation and mindfulness practice.*"

donutsilovedonuts,2021-04-01 18:40:25+00:00,"Working with ""insistent visitors"" and strong urges","I've been dealing with a very specific, and extremely insistent, set of stories/feelings for about two and a half years at this point. It manifests as a particular urge to reach out to / be in relationship with a person I knew from a few years ago. This experience continues despite the fact that I actually already semi-dated this person for two months, before breaking it off due to lack of positive investment in the relationship. Anyway, I've done a lot of work with this pattern, trying to get underneath it to find an emotional driver underneath, and have definitely made some progress in feeling some of the old developmental trauma that relates to it, as well as problems in other relationships. Nonetheless the pattern persists. I found [Jack Kornfield's article](https://jackkornfield.com/expand-field-attention/) about ""insistent visitors"" and repetitive thoughts to be quite helpful here, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of any related articles I could look at. In general, anyone who has had related experiences can feel free to chime in with this. I've been feeling very stuck lately, and have been unsure whether I just need to reach out to this person again, or whether that story is mostly a distraction from a deeper underlying issue at play."

swisstrip,2021-04-01 16:59:02+00:00,Meditation Practice Problems,"Let me start by saying that the discovery of meditation using the WakingUp app is one of the best and most important discoveries I made in a long time. I even rate this discovery amongst the most important things I have ever done or experienced (this includes my acid experiences and my coming out).

I have come into this with a more than skeptical mind, but once I tried the first few sessions of the introductory course of the app, it took only a few days until I realized that the practice already started to have some impact on my perception and getting some mindful moments throughout the days was often as easy as taking a single deep breath. 

For the next week or so the effects, like being more equanimous, less reactive and being more present in the current moment became even more noticeable. I have become deeply fascinated by this technique. Even my partner mentioned that he feels like having a transformed and kind of new person in front of him. For me, the situation was pure bliss and the feelings that went with it were rather euphoric.

Unfortunately, this state of mind did not persist. As the introductory course progressed and I also tried to do some additional meditation sessions in between, I realized that it got harder and harder to become or stay attentive and to dive in. Also, the moments where I was able to bring mindfulness into normal life got less common and even when it worked it had little effect. After another few days I realized that I am basically back to my old, mainly reactive, instead of mindful mode of operation. The only thing that stopped me of abandoning the mediation project out of frustration and anger (this gave me some sleepless nights) was the previous experience that the technique works and that there is something worth exploring.

What am I doing wrong? 

I guess I strive and want to much, which blocks me of letting go and becoming aware of the present moment. Are any ways, techniques or recommendation, how to overcome this obstacle so I can dive in again?

It is clear to me that other meditation novices must have made similar experiences. When I did a little research on how to move forward, I didn’t find much of help apart from the recommendation to let go and strive less, but the question how to actually do this remained unanswered. Therefore some down to earth advice on how to move forward would be highly appreciated."

I do it for the first 5/6 days of the month and fail to be consistent and the same thing repeats every month. Right now I'm in such a low state of my life. I'm failing academics so badly. My mind is so distracted. I can't control myself from talking to toxic online guys. I'm constantly seeking attention and validation from them. I know I don't love them and I know they don't care for me but despite knowing this I just can't control myself from chatting and wasting time on them. For the past 5 years, I did that way too much and somehow this may be the main reason for me to master the art of distraction. I really can't concentrate on anything. Even if I'm not talking to any guys and I've no problem in my life I actually cannot concentrate on my studies. I just can't focus. I am no more that small girl who used to wake up at sharp 4 am and dive into her books. I lost that spark and nothing has hurt me more than this.

I came to know about tratak and in some article, they say tratak works wonder to increase concentration and has many more benefits other than just developing concentration. In one of them, I read that it even helps to improve eyesight naturally. I'm suffering from short-sightedness so is this true that tratak can get me rid of these boring glasses? 

And does tratak works as they said? If yes then how do I stick myself to perform it on regular basis? And if no what are other forms of meditation which will help me to stay focused and be that little girl again?"

Jax_Gatsby,2021-04-01 10:48:04+00:00,Love and attachment aren't the same thing.,"Most people confuse attachment and lust with love, I've even heard some people say if you're not attached to a person then you can't love them. But the truth is as long as attachment is there, you can't love. With attachment comes fear, jealousy (which is a form of fear), possessiveness and other unpleasant things that ruin relationships.  Real love doesn't ask to be loved back because then it becomes a transaction, but people only love people who love them back and this isn't love.

As long as there is fear (which includes attachment and so on) and expectations, there can't be love because the two cannot co-exist. Things like fear and attachment are of the ego, and the ego cannot love because it is unconscious and self-centred, and a self-centred person can't love. Attachment and love are like darkness and light; when darkness is there, light isn't and vice versa.

I'll leave you with this quote:

Google, youtube is full of guided meditations and I tried a few but did not help me to even meditate for 10 min.

Sandycastles,2021-04-01 03:44:04+00:00,"Question on Judgement of Information, Yourself, and Others","Dear Cass,

Could you write one on judgment?

Thanks,

\~

Hey \~,

That is a very vague question so I will give you an interpretation on it. There are two sides to judgement: there is your own judgement of your perception of reality and there is other people's judgement of you.

Let me begin with the question: How can I trust my own judgement? This is a very good and difficult question to tackle, after all, our judgement of the world around us, of right and wrong, of true and false is just a combination of all the events and information we have been exposed to throughout the course of our lives. So when questioning your own judgement of the world around you, it's best to stick to the easy to prove. If your gut reaction to a statement is that it doesn't seem true, then the best next step is to **do your research** and I don't mean reading the headlines of popular articles, I mean look at a few different reputable sources that are written by people with real credentials. If you are going to pass judgement on information, at least have an informed opinion on the topic.

If you have fears, for example, about if getting the COVID vaccine is safe or if any vaccine is safe, please do not just look at facebook pages for research. Look to scientists, scientific publications, the CDC. Maybe look into what goes into the vaccine and how it works. You can even find first person accounts from people who received the vaccine, even people who received the vaccine during it's first couple months of human trials. Once you look at the peer reviewed articles then you can revisit what you want to do about the vaccinations.

What about if you find yourself judging other people? Again, look at what you can prove. Has this person hurt you in any way? Has this person made your life more difficult? Does this person even affect your life at all? If you are judging people from a far that will never touch your life, then it is most likely a waste of time. That person can be wrong if they want and it probably not worth expending so much energy on someone you will never meet and has no power over your life. Also, before you work yourself up thinking about how much this person might suck, remember that even if the have harmed you, they may not have realized it. There are two sides of every story and if you find yourself judging someone else for their opinions, behavior, or actions try to understand why they may be doing and saying these things. Most of the time if someone is spreading misinformation it is because they were taught that same misinformation and to them they are doing the right thing. If someone is being inconsiderate, it is usually because they have suffered some adversity whether it was that day, long ago, or even a childhood trauma.

It may be still be frustrating that the person who is bugging you doesn't seem interested in tackling the root of the problem with introspection and/or therapy, but unfortunately we can not force others to improve themselves, they have to want self-improvement on their own. The best we can do for the people who wrong us is to be a good example of calmness and love. It reminds me of a quote from one of my favorite actors, Bill Murray. He says ""The more relaxed you are, the **better** you are at **everything**: the **better** you are with your loved ones, the **better** you are with your enemies, the **better** you are at your job, the **better** you are with yourself."" It is ok to judge others for their choices, but right after you judge them, you should follow it up with compassion and love.

In a quick example, ""I hate my neighbors, they are always playing music too loud, too late in the night! "" ""maybe they don't know how loud it is from my side"" ""It is nice that they are enjoying their music."" ""Maybe I should just let them know that it is keeping me from getting to sleep on time."" .....Unfortunately this is really all you can do, at least this scenario ends with a potential solution instead of a brooding and growing anger. Maybe you do let them know that it is a nuisance and they reign it in and you find compromise and maybe even become friends. Maybe they are total d bags and they decide they don't care what you think and play their music louder to spite you. If that is the case you will have to talk to your landlord, apartment manager, or the police, but at least you didn't jump to conclusions before trying to communicate with them.

In a quick example, ""I hate my neighbors, they are always playing music too loud, too late in the night!

""Maybe I should just let them know that it is keeping me from getting to sleep on time."" .....Unfortunately this is really all you can do, at least this scenario ends with a potential solution instead of a brooding and growing anger.

If that is the case, you will have to talk to your landlord, apartment manager, or the police, but at least you didn't jump to conclusions before trying to communicate with them.

The final part of this contemplation of judgement to cover is other people's judgement of you. This can be daunting, I still find myself experiencing anxiety about cooking in my kitchen because I am afraid of being judged by my roommate. Just like in the last scenario, judgement goes both ways. You may know your own story, but you most like don't know the story of those who are judging you. When those harsh critics gave me extremely rough reviews on this blog and this cult, I was really hurt and it was really difficult not to react emotionally. I gave it some time and I now realize that they didn't know me or my reason for starting this community. To them they were putting a stop to a sinister cult during it's infancy. To them it was a open and shut case that no cult could ever be positive and they could anonymously put a stop to it before it ever grew. To them, they had a chance to stop a possible future Hitler before he grew into a monster, and I can't be mad at them for that.

Maybe those people judging you think that you are something you are not. Most judgements are quick and not based on the whole picture. Someone can think you are messy or a bad student without realizing that you are working three jobs and barely have time to take care of yourself, let alone tidy up. Someone can think you're slutty without knowing that you are actually a virgin. When worried about other's judgements of you, just remember that if they are judging you they probably don't know you, and if they know you they probably wouldn't pass negative judgement on you, and if they know you well and still think you suck, then maybe they have something they need to work on in their own lives. At the end of the day it is not the judgement that matters, its the truth and the communication of that truth that matters.

I hope this was along of the lines of what you were looking for \~. I pontificated on judgement the best I could tonight, Please feel free to ask a more targeted version of the question if I missed the mark.

In the meantime you are doing great on you journey. I am so proud of you for all the good you do.

I love you,

Cass."

whatevergotlaid,2021-04-01 01:43:35+00:00,PSA - The direct path is available right now to anybody and many of you are ready for it.,"You don't need to spend 20 years meditating to awaken to the illusion. Meditation is still useful after awakening, to observe and undo the past conditioning. But the truth is here right now for you to know, and I believe that by feeding it to you in pieces and analogies and practices, some of you aren't being given the full prescription right away and many of you can handle it. So here is my attempt to at least enlighten a few of you. I hope somebody gets something from this, at the very least.   
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The truth is, there is no self, and there is no awareness. You can't describe either of them to me. Anything you describe, will be some form of experienced *Qualia*.   


All there is, is *Qualia. or experience. or consciousness.* or whatever the hell you want to call it.

The self is built from the Qualia and feels as though it were a free agent. It's just a concept made by the mind. The mind is also *just* experienced Qualia.  


Everything you see, hear, touch, smell, think, feel, know; is happening in your mind. None of it is happening in ""the world"". The experience you are having *is the contents of your mind*. It is a type of virtual reality, representing some objective reality that is never truly known.   


Anything you are calling a self, any feeling, explanation, thought - ANYTHING you can point to, is *just another Qualia appearing in the mind*.  


This is the stream of consciousness. There is nothing outside of it, nothing to witness it, to watch it, to observe it. There is no self, and there is other self you call *awareness*. Awareness is just where we tell people to look to dissolve the mind made self. **There is** ***nothing*** **but Qualia.** This is nonduality. Not two. Everything is one. There is no subject to the object. Just the object."

I wanted to free myself once and for all.  I wasnt suicidal, i only intended to face and transcend death. If anybody else understands what i mean.

I was in so much love, faith and  courage prior to it. But I was unable to pass through. I feel so disoriented after what i did.

I was wrong how i rushed myself again.  And hence i feel so tired again.  Im unable to keep still and continue.  So many thoughts and emotions went loose from hell. 

Its so hard to walk alone.   I still havent gotten used to it.  I miss my best friend who regulalry leads me through scriptural studies which had been most effective for me to still my mind and keep my calm.  He also guided me through heart meditation. We also do Tai Chi together.

I miss having a dadah (daddy) I can call when I feel so troubled. He's a kid much younger but I have come to respect him as higher than me like a father.  But we fell apart since I felt unsafe with his new  grp and leader.

I have given up spiritual practice ever since I had no one guiding me.  I had been afraid to meditate and take it seriously since its been getting too dark and unmanageable on my own. I quit it years ago with a promise to get back only once a guru comes to me.

I recently got back when someone saw my potential and started helping me.  But i feel bad how he just tells me to stop talking as its just of the mind.  Damn how he just wanna do all the talking but have no ears.  

Damn how tiring it is how im not allowed to be human and to be a woman and to need to talk.  I wasnt even talking to him but just looking for someone to talk with. 

Damn how he demonizes the mind.  Damn all the mindlessness. Damn too all his heartlessness.

Damn how he starts off an arguement and criticizing me after I just agree with what he said.  Damn all that unnecessary pressure and discipline. 

Damn how he stirs me into love and then had to discipline me for how I love him.  I wasnt even being indecent. I was more of just expressing kind words of gratitude, transmuting the love into a higher form.  I didnt even  allow myself to flirt and attract him. 

 Damn how I only requested him not to use examples/wordings that paints a picture of being together romantically... that was all the discipline i requested on his part so that i can continue to learn from him and not  have to leave and avoid him.  But then he start to just push me away farther and avoids talking altogether.  

Damn how he messes with my heart. And then tells me to use the heart than the mind.  Damn how he cant see talking as a portal through the heart too.  And damn how I cant use my heart coz I cant be allowed to love.

Damn his method how he intentionally provokes. Damn how he says he enjoys all but lacks concerns in how the other person gets affected.  Damn all the advanced stuff just too soon for me to ponder and delve into.  

Damn how I had been on a haste to awaken and transcend time, life, and death.  Damn how I wanted to be free to love and be loved with him. Damn how I so much wanted to manifest my true self and satisfy him with all i am. VDamn how I havent before ever had a desire this deep, beyond mind and body, and yet I am so soon giving up fo he way he is, my mind just cant really like him. Damn I didnt even really like him before except by  some occult  perhaps he did.  Damn how he has many girlfriends.

Damn this love.  Damn this heart. Damn how I cant love him.  Damn how he says he loves me but doesnt love me.  Damn how I cant  even have a mind after I have lost my  heart already.  Damn why do i even have a body.

  I just miss my dadah.  How can I find a guide like my dadah. Someone who can amaze me as much and earn my respect and trust for his character and way of communicating. Someone who really teaches well and who's words bring clarity and calm rather than confusion. Someone with a real heart and tender kindness and care. 

Someone too who'd not mess with my heart unless he really means to love me.

Damn Im so tired of seeking God/Truth/Self or whatever.  And yet my life has  been all about that.  Im devoid of everything else. Im powerless without spirituality and having to meditate. But it just so tiring to walk alone.  And all the more to walk with someone who has no real love and respect for  humanity, just so full of himself."
P0ng-Wh1ffy,2021-04-01 00:04:50+00:00,Smaller. Deeper.,"Hey y’all!

So, I’m relatively new to this wonderful practice that we all are bonded by. I’ve been setting aside about 15 minutes a day for the past 2-3 weeks to sit, and it’s been marvellous. 

Truly. A life changer. I experienced something interesting— to me at least, as a newbie!— and I wanted to share it with this great like-mind for your thoughts, opinions, encouragements, admonishments— whatsoever you feel. 

I had arranged myself comfortably, and begin settling in to the practice. I began to watch my breath, first with a count for some while, and then I let go the count and stayed with the sensation of the breath. Then I felt something unusual that I hadn’t felt before, at first my natural reaction was fear of some kind. Not terror or the need for flight from it, but just a kind of trepidation, but I managed to let go of that and I sat in that sensation for a while. It was weird, but enjoyable. The only way I can describe it is in the title— I felt this sensation of becoming smaller, that was the weirdest thing, and then a more familiar feeling, I guess, of going deeper, like I’d fallen in to something. Smaller and deeper is how I felt. It was bizarre. 

Anyhow, just wanted to share, and wondered if other practitioners had experienced similar things. I’d love to hear about your experiences, too!

So, I just experienced this new thing and I wanted to share it with you. You can share your experience as well, it got me really curious.

I practiced for 15 minutes today but I was feeling my body really tense and my mind couldn't keep up the focus anymore, so I just finished the practice and sat on the bed to have some tea. There was a candle lit just in front of me. I decided to glaze at it while having my tea, and it was really fun actually, the flame was dancing so softly and it was even following a movement pattern. 

But then after a few seconds looking at it I decided to close my eyes, and then a reeeallyyyyy intense orange circle appeared in my vision, very solid and very still, perfectly delimited. And the more I focused on it, the more intense it would get. There was a point when I couldn't take the intensity of it and suddenly opened my eyes, feeling curiosity but also a little bit frightened (not exactly this but anyway). Can I do this as a daily practice? Is this ""frightening"" common? It was really unexpected...

Please, share your experiences with candle glazing! I got really curious about it and want to know more, and if there is anything that talks about it, it would be highly appreciated.

Stay safe and keep up with your practice."

personne1-1,2021-03-31 21:09:19+00:00,Not sure how to best move forward with my current practice following TMI," 

I have only been doing daily meditation for 2 months and slowly moved from 10 mins to 25 mins.

I thought by now I would be in stage 2-3 of The Mind Illuminated book but I have found myself experiencing what googling has led me to believe may be Jhanas(whole body Jhana).

During meditation today, I experienced a lot of shaking and bouncing that basically moved me to about 6 inches in front of my cushion to the floor. The past 5 days' meditations have been lesser variations of this( the day before almost having an ""O"" which I stopped because I thought it was weird and something I had never expected to experience, this happened after following the pleasure sensation in my lower belly, and the day before that, dizziness/tipsiness after following pleasure on top of my head).

I am usually there after I have basically spent about 5+ minutes of no distraction and full attention and alertness on nose sensations and once I can't feel sensations on my nose any longer ( very shallow breathing), I do a body scan and that's when I find these ""spots of pleasure"". Book wise, I am just beginning reading on the third stage since, I had imagined that this is where I would be after this time and didn't want to read too much in advance.

So, since I don't know what I am doing( when it comes to scanning the body and those strange events) and haven't read or researched enough, should I stop my body scans, which are what's leading to the shaking or should I just let myself keep experiencing the shakes and continue to read TMI as planned. I am mostly trying to avoid doing something detrimental to my body and mental health( I have very briefly read stuff about the dark night and people basically spending months bedridden because of meditation and I want to be careful with my practice."
Southern_Type_6194,2021-03-31 20:31:39+00:00,Restart Day 1,"While I've been great at keeping up with my meditation practice...I have not been great at tracking my sitting time on here. So here's a fresh start!

I typically like guided meditations, but the past two days I knew I just needed to sit in stillness based on how much I didn't want to. One of the big things I've learned in my 32 years is sitting in stillness with your shitty feelings helps you move through them more quickly than simply wallowing or keeping busy to avoid them. Neither is healthy and they'll come to the surface eventually anyways.

I've been feeling a lot of sadness over the loss of what could only be described as a situationship. Yesterday and today I pulled out my meditation pillow, lit my favorite candle, and made myself sit in stillness while just listening to my breath go in and out and just feel my feels. 

As the time ticked away I could feel the sadness and anxiety draining away leaving my core self behind. I was filled with gratitude and love for myself.

3 Reasons I'm Grateful:

* I just signed up to take psych stats which is a prerequisite for me to apply for my master's in counseling. I had to continually put this off due to chronic pain issues that have since been resolved.
* I put myself out there with the guy I was in the situationship with and I was vulnerable. It takes a lot of bravery to open your heart up and be vulnerable with another human. Especially when it involves romantic feelings. I ended up getting rejected and that really sucks, but I'm proud of myself for being vulnerable and willing to risk getting hurt. You'll never get anything you want if you aren't willing to risk things not going your way. 
* I'm grateful because I know that even though I wasn't what he wanted, and he ended up ghosting me, I'm still fucking awesome. I like myself and I'm rad. I'll find someone who's even better and thinks I'm worth going the distance for."

My thoughts were almost always rationalizations, interpretations or analysis of things I already wanted to do.

nbachickenlover,2021-03-31 18:42:42+00:00,Anybody else have vastly different experiences meditating outside vs. inside?,"Meditating outside for me is so easy and delightful. It's hard to get distracted by your thoughts when there is fresh air and so many natural sounds and feelings in the present to focus on. My best and longest meditations have in all cases been outside.

On the other hand, being inside has an uncanny amount of quietness and stillness. Lately, I've been having trouble not being overrun by thoughts while meditating inside. (Perhaps more so because of how much of my life has been confined to the inside). I would even much rather tolerate chilly weather outside than be warm inside.

That's why I look forward to the good weather, not simply because of the positive feelings associated with it, but also because it makes my meditation multitudes better.

Anyone else feel this way?"
panicsnac,2021-03-31 18:27:46+00:00,Using the stopwatch instead of a timer.,"There was a post here by someone a few days back about this, which I can’t seem to find. I just want to thank him/her for it. 

I’m a newbie at meditation and I was timing my sessions everyday until I tried using the stopwatch instead. 

A few things changed :
1. I was much more mindful of my breathing instead of thinking about when my phone was going to ring. I am comfortable with however less I had meditated because I’m confident I’m being more focused which is more important. 

2. I don’t think of it as ‘having to’ meditate for whatever time I am currently practising. Instead, it’s leaning more towards ‘wanting to’. 

3. Some days I just don’t feel like meditating, but in order to stay consistent I just sit for 2-3 minutes instead of guilty for not continuing my regular time durations. 

Overall, I think I’m getting the essence of it better now in terms if the duration not mattering but the focus and mindfulness. I’ve noticed that time passes faster than I expect when I’m not thinking about the phone ringing when the timer is up. 

I don’t really know if this will help anyone. Just sharing my experience. Thanks for reading and thanks again to the person who suggested this hack!"
saladios,2021-03-31 18:16:56+00:00,Massive Lump In Throat While Meditating?,"Hi! I’m very new to this sub &amp; very new to meditation. I’ve always loved the idea of meditating but I never thought I’d have time to actually do it! Thankfully I watched a lot of videos / read articles to guide me on how to meditate but I never saw or read what I just experienced. 

I normally meditate after I work out, it’s normally when I am at peace and when I feel calm and nice (even if my heart rate is going crazy). These past few weeks have been a very hard time on me and my overall health in general. Specifically my mother, she has not been the best at all and I unfortunately am stuck on what I should do.

Today I specifically meditating on that, like I thought and tried to help myself find the peace within the problems with my mother. I stopped though when I actually pictured my mom and I got a massive lump in my throat and just... puked. I ran to the bathroom and puked. I hadn’t even eaten breakfast but heck, I still puked. 

Has that ever happened to anyone? I’m sorry if this doesn’t belong here but I just don’t know if this means anything or if i’m like overreacting..

And if it has happened to someone, what did you do?? 

I can answer any other questions and would appreciate the help! Thank you so much!"
