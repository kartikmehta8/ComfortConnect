Those two were their main contacts from the CIA, they were given little info that the Russians could interrogate them for in the worst case scenario.

And that got the two spies thinking, what if the soviets actually captured them? They’d certainly be subjected to a slow and unpleasant death. They came to the conclusion that the CIA should at least give them cyanide pills to keep in their pockets so they can go painlessly upon being captured.

Shortly before their flight to Soviet Russia, they went to Y to tell him that unless they’re supplied with cyanide pills they will not be taking part in the operation.

Y having already invested a lot of resources into training them had no choice, he told them:

“Don’t go, X gon’ give it to ya!”"

TrumpilyBumpily,2021-04-30 14:29:44+00:00,The scholar and the skeleton (long),"There once was a town called Pleasantville, and near this town there was a large cemetery on a hill. In that cemetery lay the souls of many generations of villagers. Lately there have been sightings of strange, unexplainable things in the cemetery. The villagers of Pleasantville have grown extremely wary of it and have been avoiding visiting their ancestors to pay respects out of fear of something terrible happening.

One day, a traveling scholar was passing through Pleasantville and was chatting with the villagers at a coffee shop when he heard of this cemetery and the rumors. Being an educated man, he didn't believe in ghost stories, and volunteered to investigate so the villagers could visit their departed loved ones again. 

That night, the scholar entered the cemetery at midnight. The skies were cloudy and the moon was full. For a while he strolled the lanes between the graves, admiring the local tombstone carver's handiwork. 

Suddenly, a bony hand breached the ground several meters away. The scholar watched in quiet awe as a human skeleton climbed out of the ground and approached him menacingly.

The scholar didn't move. The skeleton stopped just a few feet away from the Scholar and gazed at him with what once was his eyes. For a moment, a deathly silence was in the air.

The scholar spoke, ""Pardon me, sir. Why is it that you are unable to rest? Do you intend to attack me? Because you have no muscles with which to raise a weapon.""

The skeleton did nothing. 

""Do you intend to eat me? Because you have no stomach with which to digest food.""

The skeleton did nothing. 

""Or, do you merely intend to frighten me? Because I am a well-learned and traveled man, and I am not easily scared.""

The skeleton broke its silence with a gravelly, uncanny voice. 

""I have returned from the pale darkness of the eternal beyond to say to you...

I'm vegan, I do Crossfit, and how dare you assume my gender?!"""

Her overly protective mother looks meaningfully into her daughter's eyes and said, ""Honey, when you go to bed tonight, your boyfriend is going to want to touch your mouth, but you must say no, because your mouth is like cotton, very delicate. Your boyfriend might ask to touch your breasts, but you must say no, because they are your diamonds, precious and they must be kept safe.""

After checking to see that her daughter is paying attention she continues, "" And at all costs, keep him away from your vagina, because that's a grill, and anything that goes into your fire will burn."" So saying, she sends off the daughter and calls her up the next day to ask how it went.

""Oh mom!"" says the daugher, ""I told him everything you said, and he said he understood it all.""

""That's wonderful, darling! That means he didn't touch you anywhere!"" says the overjoyed mother.

""Oh no mom, he told me had a nugget he wanted to fry on my grill, and every so often he'd take it out so I could taste if it was done."" replied the daughter."

PurpleFunk36,2021-04-30 09:45:17+00:00,The Devil was sitting in Hell one fine morning...,"He was busy chuckling as he watched a rerun of World War 2 on TV, when suddenly a man appeared in a burst of flames. The man was covered from head-to-toe in blood and scorch marks. 

The Devil looked at his paperwork and frowned. He didn’t seem to have a file for the man. 

“Epstein!” The Devil roared, turning to a figure in the distance, “Stop swinging on that rope and get my paperwork in order. This is the second time this week!”

“It doesn’t matter,” the man said, his eyes wide in shock, “It’s the end of the world. You wouldn’t believe what I’ve witnessed.”

“The end of the world?” The Devil asked, looking confused, “That’s odd, God wasn’t planning Armageddon until next Tuesday. He must have brought it forward. How interesting!”

The Devil looked at the man with curiosity, “Well, why don’t you tell me what you remember before you died.”

The man sighed, 

“Well, it all started when I went to visit an old friend. He had just moved into a new place. It feels like a dream now it’s over. 

I was moving through the entrance to the complex when I heard it. A low gargling noise, and dragging footsteps. The sound was truly terrifying. 

I looked to my right. And that’s when I saw it.”

“Saw what?!” The Devil asked curiously. 
 
“A zombie.”

The Devil jumped with excitement. 

“Alright,” The Devil called, turning to his minions, “Who bet God would use zombies for the Apocalypse?”

The man continued, “He was moving towards me slowly, eyes bloodshot, mouth open. His arms were raised for my throat. He didn’t even look human anymore. 

I realised in that moment that it was kill or be killed. My mind clicked into gear. This is what all those years of planning for a zombie apocalypse had paid off for. 

I pulled my trusty sidearm from my pants and let fire. Headshot of course. It’s the only way. 

Well shit went crazy then. 

Bodies started coming out of everywhere. Doors flung open and zombies began dragging themselves out. Some were crawling on the floor, some with horrific sores on their faces, others with a missing limb or too. 

All of them had the same dead look in their eyes.

I can’t tell you how many I took out. I was like Rick Grimes on drugs. Do you like zombie shows?”

“Oh yes.” The Devil nodded, “We’ve got Netflix down here, but we use Heaven’s account. It’s a victimless crime really. Like treason”

The man continued, “I came across one human who had a zombie with both arms over her shoulders. I took them both out. You can’t doubt yourself in those situations.

An alarm sounded across the complex, and I realised that I was done. I knew it was time. I pulled out a grenade from my satchel.  You always need one for an emergency.  I pulled the pin, held it, and charged at the enemy.

Next thing I know, I’m here.”

“What a story!” the Devil exclaimed, shooing away Joseph Stalin who had come to listen. 

“But we have a problem.” The Devil continued. “Let me consult my ‘Grey Area’ compendium. I’m quite sure killing zombies falls into a grey area. You know, defending your life against the undead and all.”

The Devil pulled out a book from nowhere, and flicked through the pages,

“Hmmm....Karens.....Reposters...ah! Here we are. Yes....yes I’m afraid that there’s been a mistake in your processing.” The Devil said cheerfully, “You get to go to heaven!”

The man clapped in excitement.

“Let me just make a quick call,” The Devil said, pulling a phone out of nowhere, and dialling a number. 

“Hey Jesus my man. It’s your boy Devil,” The Devil said, “I’ve got another person here that’s yours.”

An angry voice sounded on the other end of the phone. 

The Devil paused and then nodded, before hanging up the phone. 

“What’s the matter?” The man asked. 

“He said to call back in twenty minutes.” The Devil explained, “He’s got 50 people that just arrived from a retirement village.”"

At first the bird struggled but it was warm and she made it through the night in the morning it got warmer and some warms crawled up to the cow pie and the little bird had a meal. In fact she was so happy she survived and so ready for the new day she started to chirp. A cat was walking by, heard the bird, pounced and killed it.

Nevertheless, he said he saw my potential and picked me. 

The board was going to met today to discuss about an impending merger. My boss asked me to come, to get my feet wet on making big decisions about the company. I can’t help but feel optimistic, a promotion and a salary increase would really help right now. 

He offered to give me a ride home after the meeting so we can talk about what went on. I remembered our first interview, that I lingered before I answered any of his questions. So when he asked me what was my take away from the meeting, I answered straight away, “the roast beef, sir”."

So, in 1832, an American who had moved to Ontario had been hunting wild game.

Now, he hadn't bothered with the paper work for a license, as he thought it was remote enough that no one would bother.

After getting repeated warnings to stop, he was finally arrested when he shot and killed a Brown Bear and was caught stuffing it.

When he was taken to court, he freaked out that he was being charged with a crime and exclaimed: ""I'm an American citizen! I have the right to bear arms!"""

Yes! he was Dum-ba-badumping in the very unique Armenian way that no member of any other ethnicity could do. This was his way out for sure.

This is indeed a very exciting program, and I'll explain it by using a Q &amp; A format:

 

Q. What is an 'Economic Stimulus' payment ?

 
A. It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers.

 

Q.Where will the government get this money ?

 
A. From taxpayers.

 

Q. So the government is giving me back my own money ?

 
A. Yes but only a smidgen of it.

 

Q. What is the purpose of this payment ?

 
A. The plan is for you to use the money to purchase a ;high-definition TV set, thus stimulating the economy.       

 

Q. But isn't that stimulating the economy of China ?

 
A. That is correct

 

Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the Canadian economy by spending your stimulus check wisely:

 

* If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart or Costco, the money will go to China or Sri Lanka .      

 

* If you spend it on gasoline, your money could go to the Arabs.

 

* If you purchase a computer, it will go to India , Taiwan or ;China ...           

 

* If you purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to Mexico , Honduras and Guatemala ...

 
* If you buy an efficient car, it will go to Japan or Korea .

 
* If you purchase useless stuff, it will go to Taiwan .

 
* If you pay your credit cards off, or buy stock, it will go   ;   to management bonuses and they will hide it offshore.

 
Instead, keep the money in Canada by:

 
1) Spending it at yard sales, or

 
2) Going to hockey games, or

 
3) Spending it on prostitutes, or

 
4) Beer or

 
5) Tattoos.

 
(These are the only real Canadian businesses still operating  )

 
Conclusion:

 
Go to a hockey game with a tattooed prostitute that you met at a yard sale and drink beer all day!"

Mr_Big_Judda,2021-04-29 02:59:48+00:00,Old man and the IRS,"There was this old man in his 80's, that got a letter from the IRS telling him to contact them immediately. 

He calls and the IRS agent and is told he needs to come to his office regarding some irregularities with his account. 

The old man thought about it and decided he should bring his Lawyer along with him just in case. 

When they get to the office, the IRS agent pulls up the old man's file and questioned him about large sums of money going in and out of his account at irregular intervals. 

The agent stated that he needs an explination for these large sums or they would have to perform a full audit. 

The old man confesses and says that he enjoys betting from time to time. He says that he only bets substantial amounts, otherwise it's not worth betting. And he will bet on absolutely anything. 

The IRS agent, out of curiosity and needing something for his report, tells the old man to explain. 

The old man says ""alright, I bet you $5,000 I can bite my own eye."" 

Agent doesn't see how thats possible, so he agreed and the old man took out his glass eye, bit it, and put it back in. 

This perturbed the agent but a bet was a bet, and it was made in front of a lawyer. 

Not wanting to upset the IRS agent too much, the old man said ""I don't want you to get in trouble, seeing how you're an IRS agent and all. I'll let you try to earn your money back plus a little. I bet you $7,500 that I can bite my other eye"" 

Seeing that the old man didn't come in with a seeing-eye-dog, a cane, or with any other assistance, he didn't see how the old man could pull this off. So he agreed. 

The old man proceeded to pull out his teeth and bite is other eye with them. 

Now this really got the agent upset. The old man tried to appeal to him again. 

He told the agent ""I will bet you $10,000, that if you place a bucket in the corner of your office, that i can pee into that bucket from the other side of the room, and not get a single drop outside of the bucket. I tell you what since you are already $12,500 in the hole, I'll make it $15,000."" 

The agent thought there was no way possible for him to accomplish this, so he said 'you're on!"" 

The old man then proceeds to pee all over the office and not even get close to the bucket. 

The IRS agent jumps up in excitement because he won the bet. 

Even though the old man lost the bet and now owed the agent $2,500, he was pretty happy about it, but the lawyer started getting very agitated. 

The IRS agent asked why the lawyer was so upset. The old man proclaimed ""I bet him $100,000 that I could piss all over your office and that you would be happy that I was doing it!"""

She asked me to pick her up, so i did, but I wasn't expecting much. I went up to the door expecting 400 lbs of desperation, but she answer the door 5 foot 2 with baby blue eyes, strawberry blonde curls and all the right curves in all the right places. I said WOW and gave her my name. She gave me hers, so i asked what she did. 

She said ""I'm a Sunday school teacher."" 

I said ""Well, I Ain't never been with a Christian woman before but I'm open minded about the whole affair.""

So we got in my Corvette and i was trying to impress her now. I headed to the fancyest place in town that didn't take reservations. I asked her if she'd  like to smoke a joint while we wait. 

She said ""Heavens no! What would i tell my sunday school children?"" And I apologized.

I figure weed's 50/50 some people do some people don't,  so i took a few puffs and then we got a table. 

She ordered the lobster, I ordered the steak. I asked for the 2nd most expensive bottle of wine on the list, but when our waiter came to pour it, she declined saying ""Heavens no! What would I tell my Sunday school children?""

I knew right then and there it was a bust. We ate our pricey meals. We talked and laughed. Had a great time at dinnet bur I drank that whole pricey bottle by myself thinking her Christ was one helluva cock blocker. 

So I'm driving her home and we pass a cheap motel. I figure I've got nothing left to lose,  so I say ""Why don't we get a room and fuck like bunnies?""

She says ""I thought you'd never ask!""

I say ""really? What will you tell your Sunday school children?""

She says, ""The same thing I tell them every week...

So, this guy has been traveling down this old dirt road for hours. He's tired and thirsty, but there's been nothing around. Eventually, he comes across a billboard, next to a small building, that says, ""Granny's Whorehouse"". He thinks, ""Maybe I can get a few drinks and a place to rest."" He goes in and, behind what appears to be a hotel front desk is a woman who appears to be in her late 80s/early 90s.

Old Lady: Welcome to Granny's Whore House. I'm Granny. Fifty bucks and you get what you get.

Guy: Hi. I'm just looking for a few drinks and a place to rest.

Granny: Fifty bucks and you get what you get.

Guy: Fine. 

He gives her $50.

Granny: Upstairs, door at the end of the hall.

So the guy goes upstairs and goes through the door at the end of the hall. It's at this point that he realizes, there is no room behind the door, and he falls to the ground behind the building. As he's picking himself up, he sees the back of the billboard.

Back of Billboard: Congratulations! You just got screwed by Granny!"

She made a mistake, however, when she accused Frank, a new member, of being an alcoholic after she saw his old pickup parked in front of the town's only bar one afternoon.   She emphatically told Frank (and several others) that everyone seeing it there would know what he was doing!

Frank, a man of few words, stared at her for a moment and just turned and walked away.  He didn't explain, defend, or deny.   He said nothing.

Later that evening, Frank quietly parked his pickup in front of Mildred's house ... walked home ... and left it there all night."

These three cowboys were traveling south and finally crossed the border from Oklahoma into a new territory that was still owned by Mexico. As they sat down to make camp that night one of them looked around as the sun set over the horizon and asked his companions ""what should we name this place? I am not sure what the locals call it but it has not been given a name by us settlers."" One of the other cowboys looks around and crinkles his nose and then turned towards the cowboy who had spoken and said, with a sideways glance at their other companion, ""well, it certainly smells like Tex's ass after he has eaten beans for dinner."" The other cowboy laughs and gazes out past their campfire at all the scraggly brush dotting the hills and then looks at the dry dirt at his feet and says ""yeah, and it kinda looks like Tex's ass too. Lets call this place ""Tex's Ass."" And the name stuck, although over the years it has been shortened to the easier to say ""Texas."" Though it still looks and smells as much like Tex's ass as it did the day it got the name."

The other boys used to make fun of me in the locker room, girls I dated would laugh at me as soon as we got to the bedroom... I experienced nothing but humiliation my whole life, until I met my wife, god bless her. She loves me for who I am and says it doesn't matter that I have a micropenis because we can have fun in other ways, and we do, but I just wish I could satisfy her in the way a man truly should, with a good old-fashioned pounding.""

""Well,"" said the doctor, ""I can understand your situation entirely. It's more common than you think. The thing is, the drugs that are available to treat this kind of condition won't make much of a difference in size if you're starting with a penis as extremely tiny as yours. The standard surgical options have much the same problem: you simply don't have enough tissue to work with.""

The man hung his head in despair, his eyes filled with tears.

""However,"" continued the doctor, ""There is a secret experimental project, which I happen to be a part of, to develop a procedure that will help men with precisely the problem you have. If you're willing to sign a waiver and non-disclosure agreement, I can sign you up as a test subject.""

The man looked up excitedly. ""I'll sign whatever you want! What does the procedure involve?""

The doctor stared at him gravely. ""It's quite risky, and somewhat ethically questionable due to the sourcing of the donor material.""

""Tell me! Tell me!"" said man, quivering with anticipation.

""We,"" said the doctor, ""will graft the muscles from the trunk of an elephant to your penis. Not only will you be long and girthy, but you will also become so dexterous as to make you the greatest lover the world has ever known.""

No discussion was needed. The man phoned his wife to tell her the news and immediately went to be prepped for surgery.

After a long recovery, he returned home. His wife was very pleased to see him and had a beautiful dinner laid out at the table to celebrate the occasion. They sat down to their feast.

""Well,"" his wife asked, a big grin on her face, ""was the procedure a success?""

Without saying a word, the man folded his arms as his penis reached up, snake-like, grasped a dinner roll, and disappeared beneath the table.

Staggered, amazed, and astounded, his wife said, ""That's incredible! I can't believe it! Can you do that again?!""

""Probably,"" replied the man, uncomfortably, ""but I don't think I can fit another bun up my ass."""

Things are just piling up and getting on top of him. Recently his Aunt got divorced and so she has been sitting at the end of the bar drinking away his profits, his Rottweiler Chomper has just bust a tooth chewing on a rock, and the door to the toilet is off its hinges. 

Rather than sort these issues out himself, he decides to challenge one of the regulars to sort it out for him. To sweeten the deal he decides offer some free dutch courage.

Moe ""Hey Jack, Can I make you a deal? I'll give you a free pint of what ever you want, and a £100, if you do three things for me""
Jack looks up, and senses the risk ""I ain't doing shit for you Moe""

However as the night progresses, Moe keeps piling Jack with booze, and eventually the deal is agreed!


Jack ""Fuck it Moe, let's hear what you want""
Moe ""OK, so the first thing I want you to do, is fix the toilet door, the tools are over there. The second thing I want you to do is take the pliers and pull out old Chompers bad tooth, he's out the back, and finally, Old Agnus up the end of the bar, I want you to take her home and fuck her silly, make her forget her old man""

Jack takes a moment, then remembers the free drink ""I'll have a pint of Vodka!"" he shouts.

Moe pours the vodka, and Jack stands at the bar, and then just necks the whole lot. He falls flat on his face and passes out. Moe is just starting to get annoyed when Jack jumps back to his feet and runs to the toolbox. The door is back on its hinges in under 10 minutes. Everyone in the bar is watching now as they have never seen anything like it. Jack is clutching the pliers as he runs out the back door. 

The barking starts. Then there is screaming. Then more barking and growling. Then more blood curdling screaming. Then silence.... People are looking at each other wondering whats happened, is he dead?! Then all of a sudden they see Jack crawling back through the door, his clothes ripped, blood and wounds over his body and face. He is a mess. He manages to heave himself up to the bar, drops the pliers on the bar, leans over to Joe and says: 

""Right, so.... wheres the old bitch with the bad tooth?"""

""Alright, son, this is one thing that will help you become a man. It's a privilege we have that women do not, so it's important to take advantage of it. All you have to do is follow these nine steps.""

The boy listens intently and follows each direction:

""Step one: unzip your trousers.""

""Okay.""

""Step two: pull out your penis.""

""Got it.""

""Step three: pull back your foreskin. This will help you aim better.""

""Oh, I see.""

""Step four: go pee, making sure to squeeze out every drop.""

*grunts ""*Easy enough.""

""Step five: push your foreskin back into place.""

""Right.""

""Step six: tuck your penis back inside your underwear.""

""Yeah.""

""Step seven: zip up your trousers.""

""Uh huh.""

""Step eight: flush the toilet.""

""Well of course, dad.""

""Step nine: wash your hands. Your mom will raise hell if you skip this one.""

""Oh, okay.""

""And that's it! Now one last thing that your grandpa told me when he taught me all this at your age: saying the number of each step out loud will help you remember to do them in the right order and save you from making a mess.""

""Thanks dad! I feel like a real man now!""

""That's my boy.""

TombStoneFaro,2021-04-27 10:11:50+00:00,Jokes from different cultures/languages,"Years ago (like 1980) a guy from Russia brought in a joke book which had illustrated jokes from Russia/USSR and I was struck by how unfunny they were. One theme was cannibalism which I guess stemmed from WW2 sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad; I understood the jokes but was not amused.

Then, in maybe 1995 there was an international joke competition. There was the funniest joke in the world as well as what people liked in different countries. Amazed at what people thought was funny in Belgium, etc. (The winning joke I think was the Sherlock Holmes/Watson tent joke and I think the top usa joke was a hunter accidentally shoots his partner and when the 911 operator says, wait -- let's be sure he's dead, the hunter shoots him again. I did not like either joke. The Holmes joke because it involved fictional characters and the hunter joke because no 911 dispatcher would say something like that.)

I understand that Chinese jokes do not translate into English very well and knowing many native speakers of Chinese, I have noticed a very different sense of humor. I am not surprised: different culture, older humor tradition and of course a very different language.

At the same time, I can think of some jokes that should work in almost any language.

What has been your experience with humor from different cultures?"

The doctor remains calm: ""The answer lies in the genetics. Some genetics have recessive traits, which are not apparent to the parents but may be passed on to the child. For example, last week one of your sheep gave birth to a black sheep.""

The chieftain pauses for a thinking, then replies: ""I tell you what. You say no word about black sheep and I say no word about white child."""

The chicken being young &amp; playful is running all around with the dog chasing her. But suddenly the chicken falls into a mud hole and is sinking. She calls to the dog to go and get the farmer to help pull her out to safety. The dog runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's BMW back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to the chicken who grasps it, and drives the car forward saving her from sinking! 

A few days later, the chicken and horse are playing in the meadow and the chicken falls into the mud hole again. The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. But the horse said, ""I think I can stand over the hole!"" So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, ""Grab my penis and pull yourself up."" So the chicken did and pulled herself to safety.

Husband: Honey did you know that the wifi is not working?

Wife: Yes! It is so weird it hasn't been working like all day. I don't know why but I had to do this webinar class on hotspot. 

Husband: how long was the webinar class?

Wife: 4 hours.

Husband: 4 hours?! We don't have unlimited data!  Did you try to reset the internet? Or just turning it on and off or anything??

Wife: No. I didn't have time to go upstairs.

Husband: The internet is in the basement.

Wife.: Oh well see I couldn't fix it because I didn't know where it is.

Husband: Well where did you take the class?

Wife: in the basement.

Husband: Did you notice of the lights were on the internet box?

Wife: I don't even know where it is!


Since the wife was clearly getting upset, the husband decided to go downstairs and see what was wrong. He noticed that the internet is off but the router was on. At first glance he thought  think that maybe the power wire has gone bad on the modem itself.

He went to check the plugs and notice that his wife's laptop was also plugged into the power strip which was previously full of various things like the router, the desktop, monitor, speakers, and .... Now a laptop. 

The husband went back up to his wife.

Husband: I think I found the problem!

Wife: oh thank God what was wrong?

Husband: there was a laptop plugged into the power strip.

Wife: Does that stop the internet from working?

Husband: it does when you unplug the internet to plug in the laptop."

AntarcticanJam,2021-04-26 20:39:33+00:00,Two guys in the old west are walking around and come across a big hole.,"Out in the old west, two guys are out for a walk when they come across a big hole in the ground. The hole is 20 feet across, and they can't see the bottom. To figure out how deep the hole is, they decide to throw some pebbles and listen for when they hit the bottom.
They listened and listened, for about 30 seconds but heard nothing. So they grabbed some bigger rocks and eventually a boulder. But no matter what they dropped in the hole they couldn't hear anything to suggest how deep it was.

""Hey, I saw an old train car down by the tracks, just abandoned in the bushes"" said one of the men. ""Think we can push it over here? That'll certainly make enough noise that we can finally tell how deep this hole is."" 

So they walked about 1/4 mile back, uncovered the old train car, and used all their strength rolling it back to the hole. When they finally got there, they pushed the train car into the hole, and it dropped away. But to their surprise, there was still no noise. 

As they thought about what to do next, they heard a noise and turned around to see a horse, running at them in full sprint, faster than any horse they'd ever seen before. Just as the horse was about to knock them over, they dove in opposite directions to avoid being run over. Both men looked up just in time to see the horse dive head-first into the hole and disappear completely (still no noise from the bottom). Astonished, the men began discussing possibilities. Is it supernatural? Is it bottomless? 

Then they were interrupted by a cowboy stepping out of the brush. ""What're you fellas doin?"" he inquired. The men explained how they'd been out walking in the area, enjoying the day, then they found this hole.

""Wow, cool!"" said the cowboy. ""Did you happen yo meet my horse while you were out walking around? You'd love him!""

Nervously, the guys try to explain they'd just seen: a horse had just run full speed and dove into the magic hole, which seems to be bottomless.... ""Really hope that wasn't your horse, sir,"" one said.

""Naw couldn't have been my horse,"" said the cowboy ""I have him tied to an old railway car about 1/4 mile back."""

The youngest son, 15 years old, comes out and is given the same offer.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The son says, ""What if I fuck you 10 times in a row?""

The leprechaun thinks. She says, ""I will bring back your family and give you my pot of gold.

The son says, ""Wait, how do I know you will survive it?""

""What do you mean?"" says the leprechaun.

""The cow didn't."""

Cycling is a danger to the country

Now reasons: 

• He doesn't buy cars

• He doesn't take loans

• He does not insure the car

• He doesn't buy fuel

• He does not pay for car servicing

• He doesn't pay for car parking

• Moreover, he is not fat and healthy

So, yes, it can be concluded that a healthy person is not good for the economy of the country, because: - 

• He doesn't buy medicine

• He does not go to the hospital or to the doctor

• He does not make any significant contribution to the country's GDP through any significant expenses previously mentioned

Now in contrast, the man who runs a fast food shop apart from the employees is also creating another 30 jobs in the country.

How? 

• 10 Heart Physicians

• 10 dentists

• 10 weight loss dietitians / doctors / trainers.

Intrigued, he decides that he wants to learn how to play so he phones the local music teacher asking for lessons. He says “I’d like to learn how to play the piano but there’s one problem. I’m a horse.” The music teacher responds quickly saying: “Not to worry, our state-of-the-art teaching equipment will be able to get you playing in just a couple of months.” The horse, delighted in this information immediately takes up the lesson and sure enough, becomes a master at the piano in just a month.

The horse invited his friend chicken to his house to show him what he learned. The chicken, amazed by his new talent he decides that he wants to learn the guitar to join the horse so he calls up the local music teacher asking for lessons. He says “I’d like to learn how to play the guitar but there’s one problem. I’m a chicken.” The music teacher responds quickly saying: “Not to worry, our state-of-the-art teaching equipment will be able to get you playing in just a couple of months.” The chicken, excited to join his friend horse, immediately started lessons and after a month, he was able to join horse and play with him.

The two invited raccoon over to horse’s house to show him what they had done. Racoon was fascinated by it and wanted to join so decided to take up the drums to join their band. He calls the music teacher asking for lessons. He says “I’d like to learn how to play the drums but there’s one problem. I’m a raccoon.” The music teacher responds quickly saying: “Not to worry, our state-of-the-art teaching equipment will be able to get you playing in just a couple of months.” The raccoon starts his lessons immediately and after a month, he is able to join horse and chicken in their band.

Sheep was visiting horse’s house and they decided to show them what they could do. Sheep decided that the group needed a vocalist and called up the music teacher asking for voice lessons. He says “I’d like to learn how to sing but there’s one problem. I’m a sheep.” The music teacher responds quickly saying “Not to worry, our state-of-the-art teaching equipment will be able to get you singing beautifully in just a couple of months.” after a month, sheep was able to join the trio and they had a band. They called themselves “animal farm”

The band quickly became famous and they had concerts all around the world. They were about to board the plane for their biggest concert yet when the horse learned that his mother was very ill and that she would most likely not make it. The horse told the other bandmates he wouldn’t be able to come as he would have to visit his mother. The others know that horse would have to see his mother but they knew they couldn’t cancel the show so they all came up with an idea. Horse would fly back to his mother’s house where he would spend a couple of days with his mother before she passed on while the other band members would grab the next flight to the concert and stay there for a while waiting for horse. They all agreed and horse flew back to see his mother.

Horse’s mother passed away a day after he got home. He attended the funeral and was walking back when he saw on the newspaper “animal farm in a fatal plane incident. No survivors have been found.” The horse, feeling bad for himself decided to go to the pub to try and drink his problems away. He went up to the bar and the barman looked at the horse and said: ""Why the long face?"""

“I was busy teaching a class and was writing on my whiteboard. Suddenly there was a knock on my classroom door. There was an urgent message for me from the front office. My wife had been in an accident.

My wife divorced me, and here I am.” The homeless man finished.

“Wow,” the man replied, “What a story! Though I’m still confused as to why you were fired.”

“Me too! I was just writing on the board. I left so quickly I couldn’t even finish the sentence I was writing.” The homeless man said sadly.

Miraster,2021-04-26 03:32:20+00:00,"When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard."," A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate. 

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."" 

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..."" 

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing."

deliciousmalware,2021-04-26 03:28:35+00:00,A man spots an empty beach as he frantically searches for a place to land his plane.,"He's run out fuel but he is a skilled enough pilot to guide his aircraft down and gracefully crash into the sand.  He comes in at a small angle and exits his vehicle without a scratch on him.

""Damn it, what could have gone wrong?"" He ponders for a short while before he starts assessing the damages.  The propeller is mangled but the wings are intact. He sees his landing gear ripped off the plane and sticking up in the sand 15 meters away.  Thinking that he'll be able to salvage and repair his plane he walks over to the detached parts and starts digging through the sand to collect all the pieces.  He uncovers a chunk of metal that is brass, an unusual metal for airplanes.  Curious, he rubs off the layers of dirt to reveal a foreign language that begin to glow.
Smoke pours out of the now obvious antique oil lamp and forms into a genie. 

""Thank you kind stranger, it has been many years since I have been trapped in that lamp.  As a show of gratitude I will grant you one wish!  I am a genie, not a fool so do not try to abuse my power.  Give me good reason not to turn your desires against you and I will not.""

After a few moments of chin scratching and looking around him, the man responds.  ""I'm constantly making the same mistakes, over and over.  Take this for instance, this is my second air plane.  I can never figure out what I'm doing wrong. Please, Mr. Genie,  I wish for better hindsight""

With a raised eyebrow and a short pause the Genie asks ""Are you really sure this what you want?""

""Yes!"" The man answers with no hesitation.

""It is done!"". With a loud gust of wind the genie flies out to sea.  The man sits in the sand and looks out towards the sunset.  ""I should have fueled up before I left!"" He says as he puts his face into his palms. 

He looks up in horror.  ""I should have wished for better foresight!"""

They run into the barn and hide in some barrels they find there. Shortly after the sheriff and his deputy show up looking for them. 
The sheriff looks around and asks his deputy to check the barn while he goes and checks the fields. The deputy, a lazy guy, pops into the barn. He sees some barrels, some hay, but nothing really interesting. He heads back out to the car. The sheriff asks, “did you find anything interesting?”
The deputy replies, “Just a couple of barrels and some hay”
“Did you check the barrels?”
“No...”
“Go check the barrels!”
The deputy heads back to the barn, grumbling as he goes. When he arrives, he decides instead of checking each one, he was just going to kick them.

br34kf4s7,2021-04-26 01:47:43+00:00,Three men crash in a plane over the Amazon rainforest and are immediately captured by cannibals,"To their surprise, the cannibals don't immediately kill them. Instead, they show the men (through pictures and such) the beginning of an ancient ritual which, upon successful completion by the men, will result in their freedom.

For the first step, they are instructed to go off into the jungle and collect ten pieces of a single kind of fruit.

The first man comes back triumphantly holding ten oranges. He is overcome with dismay when the second part of the ritual is revealed to him: he must now put all ten of the fruits up his ass without making the slightest noise, or he will be killed.

He fits an entire orange up there but when he starts to put the second in, he whimpers in pain. The cannibals kill him on the spot, roast him, and eat him.

The second man returns with a handful of ten grapes. The second part of the ritual is also explained to him, and he feels confident he can succeed. Sure enough, he starts popping them in his rectum one by one, and eventually is left with only one grape to go. However, as he is about to insert it, he suddenly bursts out laughing. The cannibals murder him and eat him.

The two men meet each other up at the Pearly Gates. The first man can't believe it.

""You were almost there!"" He says to the second man. ""You could've lived! Why did you laugh?""

""Because,"" says the second man, ""I saw the third guy coming back with pineapples."""

PixelPete2,2021-04-25 19:42:07+00:00,Old farmer Joe just uses all his savings to buy 51 sheep...,"To pass the season he plans to reproduce the 50 female sheep he bought with one ram doing the work.  


 To his misfortune the ram dies suddenly just after he got it. He goes to complain to his neighbor Bob about his problems and Bob, who also was a farmer, told him he had to do the job himself to impregnate the sheep.

""Are you insane!"" exclaims Joe  


""The same happened to Billy last year"" Said Bob, ""He did the job himself and it worked.""

""You gotta get the truck every morning, get the sheep in, take them to the hills and do the job. If in the afternoon, the sheep are in the shade beneath the trees, it means they are gravid.""

So farmer Joe, with no other recourse, wakes up next morning at 6 am and takes the sheep up the hill. He goes one by one, huffing and puffing until mid day. He comes home exhausted and lays in bed, when the afternoon comes, he can't get out of bed of exhaustion and he calls his wife Helen.

""HELEN, ARE THE SHEEP IN THE SHADE BENEATH THE TREES!?""

""No Joe"", says the old lady, ""They are out on the sun"".

So, next day farmer Joe goes and does exactly the same as the day before. One by one, huffing and puffing and hissing. He drives back in his truck and is absolutely and completely depleted.

He goes to bed out of tiredness and exclaims when the afternoon arrives ""HELEEEN, ARE THE SHEEP IN THE SHADE OR THE SUN?!""

&amp;#x200B;

""They are in the sun, Joe"", says Helen. 

&amp;#x200B;

So farmer Joe is very determined to do this, as he might lose his lively hood if the sheep don't reproduce.

&amp;#x200B;

He wakes up next morning, takes the sheep in his truck to the hills, and again huffing, puffing, hissing, he goes one by one until he is finished with all. He heads back home, lays in bed utterly and miserably dog-tired. After a couple of hours he calls his wife Helen, ""HELEEEEN, ARE THE SHEEP IN THE SHADE THIS TIIIME?!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""No Joe"" says Helen confused ""They are in the truck honking the horn!"""

The other two men see that their friend is ok, and are excited to try their luck. The second man runs and jumps. “The softest clouds ever!” Once again, the genie grants that wish and the second man lands on the clouds and they gently carry him away.

""Good question father,"" replies the man. ""It's not exactly my hat, but I know that Solomon comes here every Sunday and he wears the same hat. So I figured that when he goes into confession, I'll just nip on over and take it for myself!""

The priest is a bit disappointed, but leaves the man to his devices.

The service goes on as normal, and afterwards the priest notices that the man is still sitting there with no hat.

""Well,"" says the priest. ""Looks like you changed your mind! I'm glad!""

The man replies, ""Oh yes, father! You see, I was going to take Solomon's hat, but I was listening to your service this morning and it really resonated with me. I especially enjoyed the part about the Ten Commandments!""

With a bit of smugness, the priest says, ""Ah, so you must have liked the part about 'Thou Shalt Not Steal'?""

One night he’s in bed and she turns off the light to make it harder for him to realize their trick. She makes up a last minute excuse to leave the room and a minute or two late he hears what he assumes is her coming back into the room and climbing into bed.

They start making out and end up having incredible sex. At some point in the night they switched back.

He woke up next to his girlfriend and she smiled, asking if he enjoyed “our sex”. He explained to her he’d been onto them the whole time and that he knew it wasn’t her from the very start.

She looked at him shocked and asked how he knew.

He said, “your hands are smaller than his.”"

He soon realized she was heading straight towards his seat.

As fate would have it, she took the seat right beside his.

Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, ""Business trip or pleasure?""

She turned, smiled and said, ""Business. I'm going to the Annual Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston."" 

He swallowed hard. 

Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs. 

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your business role at this convention?"" 

""Lecturer,"" she responded. ""I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about it."" 

""Really?""  he said. 

""And what kind of myths are there?"" 

""Well, she explained, ""One popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait."" 

""Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Jewish descent who are the best."" 

She went on, ""I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck."" 

Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed. 
""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don't even know your name..."" 

""Tonto,"" the man said, 

""Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba."""

Samuelabra,2021-04-25 14:49:37+00:00,50 Dollars is 50 Dollars,"Every year, a couple goes to the county fair. At this fair, they offer helicopter rides where couples can ride for 50 dollars.

The husband asks, ""Do you want to go on the helicopter?""

The wife replies, ""Well it would be fun but 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

So the couple decides not to go and moves on.

The next year, they come back to the county fair and the helicopter rides are there again. The husband asks again, ""What do you think, should we go on it?""

""I don't know,"" the wife says. I know it would be great to go up there but 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

So the couple decides not to go.

The following year, they come back and the husband says, ""I really think we can do it this time! What do you think - should we go on the helicopter?""

The wife says, ""I'm really not sure - I would really love to, but 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

The pilot of the helicopter overhears this conversation and says to the couple, ""Excuse me - I couldn't help but notice that you were having some trouble deciding. Well I'll tell you what - I will take the both of you up in the helicopter, and if you don't make a single sound whatsoever while we're up there, then the whole ride is free. What do you say?""

The couple thinks for a few minutes, then finally agrees to take the deal.

So the pilot takes them both up in the helicopter, and they are completely silent. In order to try and get his money's worth, the pilot purposely makes this a shaky, uncomfortable ride, making sharp turns, jostling the copter, hoping that the couple will crack. But alas, no such luck - the pilot does not hear a peep for the entire ride.

The pilot lands the helicopter and says, ""Well, a deal's a deal! I have to say, I really thought I was going to get you guys - I'm impressed!""

And the husband replies, ""Yeah, I about said something when my wife fell out, but 50 dollars is 50 dollars!"""

Saint Peter opens the door, looks at him and says: ""Welcome to live after death. What is your name?"" The pope is slightly irritated and answers: ""I am the pope."" ""Pope who?"", Peter asks. ""Pope Francis, you should know who I am!"" the pope says, a bit upset. Peter looks into his book and says: ""Hmm, I can't find a Francis Pope in here. Are you sure you are at the right place?"" The pope doesn't understand what's going on: ""This must be a misunderstanding. I am the pope, god's representative on earth!"" Peter looks at him: ""Oh. I'm not aware the boss sent somebody down to earth to represent him. Please wait a minute, I'm going to talk to him.""

So Peter goes to god's throne and says: ""Boss, there's this guy at the door, he says his name is Pope and he insists he is your representative on earth. Do you know anything about that?"" God answers: ""I don't know what he means. Maybe we could ask Jesus?""

So they call Jesus and tell him what's going on. Jesus says: ""I don't know what this guy is talking about either, but I'm going to talk to him."" So he goes to heaven's door to talk to the pope. A few minutes later he comes back, laughing: ""Peter, you won't believe this. Do you remember that fishing club we've founded back in our time? It still exists!"""

Upon entering the examination room, Dr. Chang said, ""OK, take off all you crose."" The woman did as she was told. ""Now, get down and craw reery, reery fass to odder side of room."" Again, the woman did as she was instructed. Dr. Chang then said, ""OK, now craw reery, reery fass back to me."" So she did.

Dr. Chang shook his head slowly and said, ""Your probrem vewy bad. You haf Zachary Disease. Worse case I ever see. Dat why you not haf sex or dates.""

Former_Rush_752,2021-04-25 07:02:55+00:00,"Best jokes you've never heard, Part two.","A woman would like to take a trip cross country with her parrot. However, when she goes to book the flight, she realizes that she only has enough money for a flight that's non-smoking and no parrots allowed. With a plan in mind, she purchased the ticket and decided to take a chance and hopefully get away with it. She gets through security with no problem, with her pet parrot stuffed in her jacket, and is on the flight in no time with little to no setbacks along the way. Sitting comfortably in her chair on the plane, she is ready to travel.

In the middle of the flight, the pilot came out of the cockpit smoking a massive cigar and was greeting all the people on the plane. He slowly but surely is approaching the woman.

""How's is your flight going, Ms.?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh it's going just fine, thank you""

&amp;#x200B;

As he started to walk away he heard something muttered from behind

&amp;#x200B;

""Poly want a cracker"" 

&amp;#x200B;

He quickly turns around and asks the woman what that noise was

&amp;#x200B;

""Nothing, nothing don't worry""

&amp;#x200B;

Confused he turned back around and proceeded to walk down the aisle.

&amp;#x200B;

""Poly want a cracker""

&amp;#x200B;

He flips around again and stares into the woman's eyes. He then rips open her jacket to reveal the parrot sitting happily in its cage. 

&amp;#x200B;

""THIS IS A NO PARROT FLIGHT!"" he shouts, as he grips the parrot in his palm, opens up the plane window, and chucks it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

""OH YEAH? WELL, THIS IS A NO SMOKING FLIGHT!"" as she rips the cigar from his lips and throws it out the window. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the altercation, the pilot storms off back to the cockpit, obviously flustered and regains control of the plane. Minutes go by and then there is a slight \*tap\* \*tap\* \*tap\* on the window. It's the woman's parrot. And he has something in its mouth. The Brick."

Three friends are gathered around a pile of bricks, one of them mutters

""let's see who can throw a brick the highest""

They all grab hold of brick and get ready to compare throwing heights. One of them realizes that it would be impossible to judge how high the bricks went from the ground. Luckily it had rained and the ground they were standing on was completely muddy. With this fact, they will be able to tell who can throw the highest by measure how far in the ground the brick sank.

The first friend gathers up his energy and launches a brick high into the sky, the brick falls down and sinks 3 feet into the dirt. The second friend scoffs at this ""pathetic"" attempt and launches a brick even higher, and it sinks 5 feet into the ground. The third friend laughs and his friend's lame excuses of throws, and launches a brick so high into the sky, and it never comes down. He lost."

I pretended to drive away, waited down the block for an hour, and rushed home. I burst in to take stock, saw that my wife was in the shower, and searched high and low for the lover I feared Id find. I nearly gave up when I noticed a man hanging by his fingertips off my balcony. Enraged, I beat and kicked viciously at his fingers. He held on so I whipped out a hammer and bludgeoned his grip free. He fell 2 stories but was still alive. I grabbed the refrigerator (it weighed a ton) and pushed it off the ledge, crushing him to death. I immediately was overwhelmed with remorse and shot myself in my bedroom."" The Saint, looking a mixture of disgust and remorse, thanks him and pulls aside the next man, who says, ""I was practicing yoga on the rail of my 4th floor apartment when a gust suddenly tipped my over. Luckily I managed to grab the rail on the floor below me. Then this madman runs out and starts wailing on my hands. I cling for dear life pretty well until the hammer came out.

Ventura early this morning, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu
A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed
the problem was NOT Avian Flu.
The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it
was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws.
By analyzing these paint residues it was found that 980 of the crows had been impacted by
 motorcycles, while only20 were impacted by cars.
The investigators then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a
cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills.
The Ornithological Behaviorist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill,
they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the
lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike"""

The second guy cheated on his wife once or twice over the years, but overall was pretty faithful, so God gave him an Acura to drive around in heaven.

The third guy never cheated on his wife at all and was the most faithful he could have possibly been, so God gave him a Rolls-Royce to drive around in heaven.

Sometime later, the first and second guy found the third guy sitting down crying. When they asked him what was wrong, he said ""I just saw my wife riding down the road on a skateboard."""

Kreastricon,2021-04-24 23:00:16+00:00,Corey the Drapery Salesman,"Hope you like this joke, I just made it up.

Corey owned a business where he sold drapery for windows, and he was doing very well!

His business was thriving and making money. It was probably because he was a very friendly person who promised his customers 100% satisfaction on everything he sold. People knew him to be timid and frail, but he also perseveres to bring people service with a smile.

And that's when three thieves saw an opportunity. 

They decided to rob his store and take all his money. ""He's a big softy, robbing him will be easy!"" they thought.

Later that night, the three thieves walk into his store, pretending to be shopping. Corey greeted them with the usual hello, but noticed something off about them, and that's when the three each pulled a knife on him.

""Alright Corey! Give us all your money!"" the three men said.

Yet Corey hesitated. Instead of shrinking from fear, a fire started to brew in him, and that's when he yelled ""LIKE HELL I WILL!""

And the fight of a lifetime broke out!

Corey was outnumbered three to one and the odds were against him but he went at them anyway. Fists were thrown knocking down everything in the store. Windows were shattered by people being thrown through them. Corey's precious drapery got torn off the hooks. Knives were disarmed, bones were broken, and noses were bleeding all over the place.

And then... it was over. The three men lay on the ground, broken and bruised. Corey had won the battle.

How was a drapery salesman able to beat up three thugs armed with knives at night you ask?

That's easy.
